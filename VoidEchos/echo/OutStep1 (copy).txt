Thunder 
Was there a thunderstorm

Oh  sure  You bet 
Like it
Say  there isnt anything I like better 
would like to be with a circus I mean  for goodDad  I think he wants me to be Huh! Astronomer!
A circus would be more fun 
Youre just saying that 
No  Im not  I mean it 
right now  What would you doI--I--
See!
Id join up 
Go on 
Try me 
in with meWhat do you mean
even have a circus of our own  We could be the biggest circus-fellows inthe world  Thats if you want to go in with me  Otherwise--Well  I guessI can do it on my own  I just thought: Lets give good old Slim achance Im in! What is it  huh  Red Tell me what it is Figure it out  Whats the most important thing in circuses
Acrobats
Holy Smokes! I wouldnt go five steps to look at acrobats 
I dont know then 
crowds Even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts Do you think so
morning  Two of them And youve got them
Sure  Thats the secret  Are you telling
Of course not 
Okay  Ive got them in the barn  Do you want to see them
Are they big
only about so long  Ive got them in a cage cant get away from there  Come on  lets go up to the loft Theres sort of a hole in the canvas 
Howd that get there
Theyre still there 
The canvas appeared to be burned 
You want to look  or dont you
Watch out 
They dont hurt you 
Ever see anything like them
No 
Cant you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these
Maybe theyre too small for a circus 
Youre just trying to back out  arent you
No  Im not  Its just--
worry Whats that
to figure out what to feed them meanwhile

Where are the youngsters My son isnt in his room 
breakfast was forced into them among the women some time ago  so thereis nothing to worry about  Youth  Doctor  youth!Youth!
think theyll come  The day looks so--normal Theyll come 
your playing so elaborate a hoax  You really spoke to themAs I speak to you  At least  in a sense  They can project thoughts 
I gathered that must be so from your letter  How  I wonder 
perhaps it was just that I could not understand  It involves a projectorfor the focussing of thought and  even more than that  consciousattention on the part of both projector and receptor  It was quite awhile before I realized they were trying to think at me  Suchthought-projectors may be part of the science they will give us Perhaps 
bring to society  A thought-projector!Why not Change would be good for us 
I dont think so 
It is only in old age that change is unwelcome 
and races can be old as well as individuals 
built Beforethewars  I dont know exactly when  It is as good now as theday it was built  We couldnt possibly duplicate it now  The race wasyoung when that was built  ehThen Yes! At least they werent afraid of new things 
Destroyed  Doctor! What good were youth and new things We are betteroff now  The world is peaceful and jogs along  The race goes nowhere butafter all  there is nowhere to go  They proved that  The men who builtthe road  I will speak with your visitors as I agreed  if they come  ButI think I will only ask them to go The race is not going nowhere 
going toward final destruction  My university has a smaller student bodyeach year  Fewer books are written  Less work is done  An old man sleepsin the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging  but each day findshim nearer death all the same Well  well 
position in the planetary economy And you found me solvent
far off  You are less solvent than your father and he was less solventthan his father  Perhaps your son will no longer be solvent  It becomestoo troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that stillexist  though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of Beforethewars  Wewill be back to village economy and then to what The cavesof all thatbroadening of horizons  Look  sir  I chose you to approach in thismatter not only because you were rich and influential with governmentofficials  but because you had an unusual reputation  for these days  ofdaring to break with tradition  Our people will resist change and youwould know how to handle them  how to see to it that--that--That the youth of the race is revived
Yes 
With its atomic bombs
The atomic bombs 
civilization  These visitors of mine had their atomic bomb  or whatevertheir equivalent was on their own worlds  and survived it  because theydidnt give up  Dont you see It wasnt the bomb that defeated us  butour own shell shock  This may be the last chance to reverse theprocess Tell me 
want in returncome from a denser planet  Ours is richer in the lighter atoms They want magnesium Aluminum
No  sir  Carbon and hydrogen  They want coal and oil 
Really
have mastered space travel  and therefore atomic power  would want coaland oil  I cant answer that the truth of your story  Superficially  atomic power would seem topreclude the use of coal and oil  However  quite apart from the energygained by their combustion they remain  and always will remain  thebasic raw material for all organic chemistry  Plastics  dyes pharmaceuticals  solvents  Industry could not exist without them  evenin an atomic age  Still  if coal and oil are the low price for whichthey would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth  my answeris that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis There are the boys!
as much of it as it ever had Yes  but we age them quickly and pour them into the mold 
Whats this
didnt know anyone was here  I am sorry to have interrupted Its all right  youngster 
son  there would be no cause for slamming a door Nonsense 
You simply scold him for being young  You  with your views!Come here  lad 
How do you like the country  eh
Very much  sir  thank you 
My son has been showing you about the place  has he
Yes  sir  Red--I mean--
two up to  ehWhy--just exploring  sir 
curiosity and adventure-lust  The race has not yet lost it Sir
Yes  lad 
me in for something good to eat  but I dont exactly know what he meant I didnt like to say so Why  just ask cook  Shell have something good for younguns to eat 
Oh  no  sir  I mean for animals 
For animals
Yes  sir  What do animals eat
I am afraid my son is city-bred 
Well 
an animal  ladA small one  sir 
would probably do the trick Thank you  sir 
Do you suppose theyve trapped an animal alive
country  full of rodents and small creatures  Red is always coming homewith pets of one sort or another  They rarely maintain his interest forlong shouldnt they
III

Unbelievable!
Oh  there are larger worlds 
Inhabited
Well  no 
Why  you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it 
Not quite 
inhabitants are large in proportion to their worldNearly ten times our height 
Are you sure they are friendly
imponderable  They are not dangerous  I think  Weve come across othergroups that could not maintain equilibrium after the atomic war stageand you know the results  Introversion  Retreat  Gradual decadence andincreasing gentleness Even if they are such monsters
The principle remains 
We are descending a bit too quickly 
landed you safely twice before Why do you keep silence
your Floater and help me prepare the Ejector Are you hurt
Ive sprained something  It hurts to walk 
have to walk despite the pain Cant we rest first
can be repaired  we may live  Otherwise  we wont Just a few minutes  Let me catch my breath 
you you talk to itProjector  It wont be listening Then blast it  Blast it down 
We cant do that 
you fool
Why not
plain sight  Dont be afraid of falling with this planet  Youll never even leave it  You probably wont livethe day out Why Why
happens when a trader kills a native young  even accidentally  Whatsmore  if this is the target-point  then we are on the estate of apowerful native  This might be one of his brood What are they doing
seems to be the native equivalent of grass 
IV

No ones around  I had my eye peeled  you bet 
got to scoot back to the house What is it
what you shouldve got when I sent you to the house instead of comingback with that stupid grass doesnt come loose like that  It comes in cellophane and it isnt thatcolor till its cooked You mean it isnt cooked
take it  It wont hurt you  I tell you there isnt much time Why Whats doing back at the house
theyre looking for me  Maybe the cook told them I took the meat Anyway  we dont want them coming here after me Didnt you ask the cook before you took this stuff
water because Dad makes her  Come on  Take it Hi  Dad  Hello  sir 
youYes  Dad
Mother tells me you were out early this morning 
Not real early  Dad  Just a little before breakfast 
night and didnt go back to sleep Yes  sir 
What was it that awakened you
thunder  sort of  and like a collision  sort of Could you tell where it came from
It sounded like it was out by the hill 
walk toward the hill I am ready 
Come on 
Did they say anything about the meat
No  I guess they dont know about that  They went down to the hill 
What for
animals eat the meatWell 
smelling it or something Okay 
eat something  Lets walk along toward the hill and see what Dad andyour father are going to do What about the animals
you give them waterSure  They drank that 
bring them fruit  Anythingll eat fruit 
V

You think the noise was their ship landing
Dont you think it could be
If it were  they may all be dead 
Perhaps not 
If they have landed  and are still alive  where are they
Think about that for a while 
I dont understand you 
They may not be friendly 
Oh  no  Ive spoken with them  Theyve--
next step be InvasionBut they only have one ship  sir 
You know that only because they say so  They might have a fleet 
Ive told you about their size  They--
superior to our artillery That is not what I meant 
I had this partly in mind from the first 
letter  Not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade  but to judgetheir real purposes  I did not count on their evading the meeting any rate  The world has been at peace too long  We are losing a healthysense of suspicion will speak  I tell you that there is no reason to suppose they canpossibly be hostile  They are small  yes  but that is only importantbecause it is a reflection of the fact that their native worlds aresmall  Our world has what is for them a normal gravity  but because ofour much higher gravitational potential  our atmosphere is too dense tosupport them comfortably over sustained periods  For a similar reasonthe use of the world as a base for interstellar travel  except for tradein certain items  is uneconomical  And there are important differencesin chemistry of life due to the basic differences in soils  Theycouldnt eat our food or we theirs domed stations of lowered air pressure  devise specially designedships in its youth  It is simply that they dont have to do any of that  Thereare millions of worlds suitable for them in the Galaxy  They dont needthis one which isnt How do you know All this is their information again 
This I was able to check independently  I am an astronomer  after all 
That is true  Let me hear what you have to say then  while we walk 
that two general classes of planetary bodies existed  First  the planetswhich formed at distances far enough from their stellar nucleus tobecome cool enough to capture hydrogen  These would be large planetsrich in hydrogen  ammonia and methane  We have examples of these in thegiant outer planets  The second class would include those planets formedso near the stellar center that the high temperature would make itimpossible to capture much hydrogen  These would be smaller planets comparatively poorer in hydrogen and richer in oxygen  We know that typevery well since we live on one  Ours is the only solar system we know indetail  however  and it has been reasonable for us to assume that thesewere the only two planetary classes I take it then that there is another 
than the inner planets of the solar system  The ratio of occurrence ofhydrogen-ammonia planets and these super-dense water-oxygen worlds oftheirs over the entire Galaxy--and remember that they have actuallyconducted a survey of significant sample volumes of the Galaxy which we without interstellar travel  cannot do--is about 3 to 1  This leavesthem seven million super-dense worlds for exploration and colonization And worlds like ours
found which contains them  Apparently the development of our solarsystem was unique and did not follow the ordinary rules creatures from space are asteroid-dwellers in one out of eight stellar systems  but theyre completely differentfrom what weve been discussing still only quoting their unsupported statementspresented me with a theory of stellar evolution which I had to acceptand which is more nearly valid than anything our own astronomy has everbeen able to devise  if we except possible lost theories dating fromBeforethewars  Mind you  their theory had a rigidly mathematicaldevelopment and it predicted just such a Galaxy as they describe  So yousee  they have all the worlds they wish  They are not land-hungry Certainly not for our land intelligent and not reasonable  Our forefathers were presumablyintelligent  yet they were certainly not reasonable  Was it reasonableto destroy almost all their tremendous civilization in atomic warfareover causes our historians can no longer accurately determineover those islands--I forget the ancient name--there was only one end insight  and in plain sight  Yet events were allowed to proceed to thatend on a fools errand after all No fools errand  sir  Look there 

VI

something what this is  Its a space-ship  That must be why my father came here Hes one of the biggest astronomers in the world and your father wouldhave to call him if a space-ship landed on his estate He only came here because I told him I heard the thunder from here Besides  there isnt any such thing as a space-ship you can see the rocket tubes How do you know so much
them  Old books  From Beforethewars Huh  Now I know youre making it up  Books from Beforethewars!
job usWell  it is  too  a space-ship 
Look here  Slim  you mean thats a ship from another world 
wouldnt be so interested if it was anything else Other worlds! Where are there other worlds
of them  And other stars probably have planets  Theres probablyzillions of planets Youre crazy!
All right  then  Ill show you 
Hey! Where are you going
he tells you  I suppose youll believe a Professor of Astronomy knowswhat--here  Do you want them to start asking questions and find out about ouranimalsI dont care  You said I was crazy 
Snitcher! You promised you wouldnt tell 
fault  for starting an argument and saying I was crazy I take it back  then 
Well  all right  You better 
Its awfully small for a space-ship 
Sure  because its probably a scout-ship 
Ill bet Dad couldnt even get into the old thing 
spend all day here looking at some old space-ship or whatever it is Weve got to take care of the animals if were going to be circus-folks Thats the first rule with circus-folks  Theyve got to take care of theanimals  And anyway What for  Red Theyve got plenty of meat  Lets watch 
and I guess its about lunch time or theyre going to start investigating  Holy Smokes  dont you everread any detective stories When youre trying to work a big dealwithout being caught  its practically the main thing to keep on actingjust like always  Then they dont suspect anything  Thats the firstlaw--Oh  all right 

VII

such construction What good is it now
left  Therell be no second landing  This ship detected life on ourplanet through accident  Other exploring parties would come no closerthan necessary to establish the fact that there were no super-denseworlds existing in our solar system Well  theres no quarreling with a crash landing 
might have been repaired different  Too disturbing  In any case--its over Lunch about ready  dear 
Im afraid not  You see--
Is anything wrong
our guest wont mind a little family discussion Pray dont pay any attention whatever to me 
Ive been soothing her for hours and honestly  I dont know why Redshould have done it Done what
Red
Hes taken most of the chopped meat 
Hes eaten it
Well  I hope not  It was raw 
Then what would he want it for
Meanwhile cooks just furious  She caught him vanishing out the kitchendoor and there was the bowl of chopped meat just about empty and she wasgoing to use it for lunch  Well  you know cook  She had to change thelunch menu and that means she wont be worth living with for a week Youll just have to speak to Red  dear  and make him promise not to dothings in the kitchen any more  And it wouldnt hurt to have himapologize to cook lunch menu  why should shetalking about quitting  Good cooks arent easy to get  Do you rememberthe one before herright  He isnt here  I suppose  When he comes in  Ill talk to him Youd better start  Here he comes 
guess Got to clean up first  though 
One moment  son 
Sir
Wheres your little friend
walking and I looked around and he wasnt there said  I suppose its about lunch time  I said  We got to be gettingback to the house  And he said  Yes  And I just went on and then whenI was about at the creek I looked around and--about my youngster  He is quite self-reliant  Dont wait lunch for him Lunch isnt ready in any case  Doctor 
something happened to the ingredients  Do you have anything to saySir
take the chopped meatThe chopped meat
The chopped meat 
Well  I was sort of--
Hungry
For raw meat
No  sir  I just sort of needed it 
For what exactly
words--Youll remember that just after breakfast my son came in to askwhat animals ate take it for an animal pet youve gotsaid I had an animal He came in here and said that He said I had ananimalpromised he wouldnt tell on you  he didnt  Its your own foolishnessin trying to take something without permission that gave you away  Thathappened to be stealing  Now have you an animal I ask you a directquestion Yes  sir 
All right  youll have to get rid of it  Do you understand
meat-eating animal  Red It might bite you and give you blood-poison Theyre only small ones 
them They How many do you have
Two 
Where are they
Dont chivvy the child any further 
and thats punishment enough 
VIII

got to speak to Red  Ive got to say something youre being very polite  Youve kept lunch waiting Im sorry  Father 
Oh  dont rate the lad 
to Red if he wants to  and there was no damage done to the lunch Ive got to speak to Red alone 
Now thats enough 
Take your seat 
looseNo  its--
of telling my Dad we were feeding animalsas saying we were doing it  Besides  its something else  Red thought you were coming to the house  They acted like it was my faultyou werent there and let me talk  You dont give a fellow a chance Well  go on and tell me if youve got so much to say 
anymore and I wanted to see what it was like It isnt a space-ship 
looked inside and they were dead They were dead 
Who were dead 
animals  Theyre people-things from other planets Oh  my 
find outWe better turn them loose 
Theyll tell on us 
They cant talk our language  Not if theyre from another planet 
like that to my mother when he didnt know I was in the room  He wastalking about visitors who could talk with the mind  Telepathery orsomething  I thought he was making it up Well  Holy Smokes  I mean--Holy Smokes 
Dad said to get rid of them  Lets sort of bury them somewhere or throwthem in the creek He told you to do that 
to do what he says  Holy Smokes  hes my Dad golly  if they find out  will we be in trouble!

people 
people 
Theyre making noises 
I guess theyre talking or something 
Arent you going to do something
Arent you
You found them 
Its your turn  now 
watching You joined in  Slim  You know you did 
here looking for us All right for you 
Wait!
Now whats biting you
something Where
if hes people  maybe its a disintegrator gun Whats that
space-ships have disintegrator guns  They point them at you and you getdisintegratored They didnt point it at us till now 
Im getting my father Cowardy-cat  Yellow cowardy-cat 
them now youll get disintegratored  You wait and see  and itll be allyour fault where youre keeping them  Cook saw where you ran with the meat Hello  ma!
rid of them right away just looked like little animals and I thought youd let me keep them ma  I wouldnt have taken the meat only they wouldnt eat grass orleaves and we couldnt find good nuts or berries and cook never lets mehave anything or I would have asked her and I didnt know it was forlunch and--
X

point in any publicity now what they are  No  no--I never saw anything like it  Little horrible beasts with--with--I cantdescribe it  To think that Red was touching them and trying to feedthem  He was holding them  and feeding them meat I only--
It was not--
today  March! Into the house! And not a word; not one word! Im notinterested in anything you have to say  After this is all over  Illhear you out and as for you  Red  Ill see that youre properlypunished killed anything really terrible  Theyve just found a new pet describe these animalsCan you just tell me if they--
Im sorry 
better take care of her  Will you excuse mebefore  Surely it is not usual to find animals that are completelyunique on an estate such as this Im sorry  Lets not discuss that now 
Except that unique animals might have landed during the night 
What are you implying
I think we had better go to the barn  sir!

XI

Those
Those 
repulsive to them What do they say
that they are not seriously damaged  and that the youngsters treatedthem well them grass and raw meat to eat Tell me how to speak to them to you  but perhaps not right away The youngsters were ignorant of your identity 
because we knew they meant well by us according to their own view of thematter  we did not attempt to attack them Attack them
Why  yes 
We are armed 
We hope 
repairs in their possession they let themselves be handled and caged I dontunderstand it intelligent species 
XII

Do you really think the ship will fly
If they say so 
back  I hope  before too long And when they do 
my part of the agreement  What is more I will move sky and earth to havethe world accept them  I was entirely wrong  Doctor  Creatures thatwould refuse to harm children  under such provocation as they received are admirable  But you know--I almost hate to say this--Say what
these creatures  feeding them or trying to  and keeping them hidden  Theamazing gall of it  Red told me it was his idea to get a job in a circuson the strength of them  Imagine!Youth!

XIII

Will we be taking off soon
Half an hour 
ones  We will get very good terms; very good terms You dont think theyre too close  do you It would be bad to burn anyof them with the rocket blast at this stage of the game Theyre safe 
Horrible-looking things  arent they
Pleasant enough  inside  Their thoughts are perfectly friendly 
picked us up--They call him Red 
bad that were leaving  Only I cant make out exactly why  The nearestI can come to it is something about a lost opportunity with someorganization or other that I cant quite interpret A circus

Line and a Point by the sense of sight is  as every one knows  in thenature of things  impossible; but it can be detected by the sense ofhearing  and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained Behold me--I am a Line  the longest in Lineland  over six inches ofSpace--Of Length

How shall I make it clear  When you move straight on  doesit not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move in some other way turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards whichyour side is now fronting  In other words  instead of always moving inthe direction of one of your extremities  do you never feel a desire tomove in the direction  so to speak  of your sideKing   Never   And what do you mean  How can a mans inside any direction  Or how can a man move in the direction of his insideI   Well then  since words cannot explain the matter  I will try deeds and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desireto indicate to you At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland   As long as anypart of me remained in his dominion and in his view  the King keptexclaiming  I had at last moved myself out of his Line  he cried in his shrillestvoice    
 replied I; 
When I had done this at great length  I cried triumphantly  taking up the same position as before But the Monarch replied  Furious at his perversity  and especially indignant that he professedto be ignorant of my sex  I retorted in no measured terms  Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry asif to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same movement therearose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry  increasingin vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army ofa hundred thousand Isosceles  and the artillery of a thousandPentagons   Spell-bound and motionless  I could neither speak nor moveto avert the impending destruction; and still the noise grew louder and the King came closer  when I awoke to find the breakfast-bellrecalling me to the realities of Flatland

Elaine 
Lady Elaine Trask of Traskon 
Oh  no  Lucas!
Its bad luck to be called by your married name before the wedding 
ball  when you were just home from school on Excalibur That was when I started calling me that  too 
Theres a terrace to the west at Traskon New House 
Tomorrow  well have our dinner there  and watch the sunset together 
I know  I thought that was to be our sunset-watching place 
You have been peeking 
your surprise saw it from the air  Ill be very surprised at everything inside And very delighted 
I thought Id find you two here 
have tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow together  but need I remindyou that today we have guests  and more coming every minute Who came in the Ward car
Rovard Grauffis  And Otto Harkaman; you never met him  did you  Lucas
No; not by introduction  Id like to  before he spaces out 
Is the Duke coming
with him  Theyre at the Palace now back in town Oh  dear! I hope he doesnt--
Has Dunnan been bothering Elaine again
speak with her  We got him to leave without too much unpleasantness after tomorrow Im terribly sorry for him 
have let me talk to him  I might have made him understand yourself to that! The man is insane!Elaine  your shawl!
Ill have to come back  some time  and visit them 
Theyll miss me 
Youll find a lot of new friends at your new home 
You wait till tomorrow 
Im going to put a word in the Dukes ear about that fellow 
maybe itll do some good I doubt it  I dont think Duke Angus has any influence over him at all 
Didnt there use to be something they called privacy
Its a big story  Sesar 
with us  I know everybody at Traskon is watching this by screen You havent met Captain Harkaman  Lucas 
I know your attitude  but hes a good sort  Personally  I wishwe had a few like him around here 
II

now that I meet you  let me congratulate both Youre not an investor in the Tanith Adventure  are you
Lord Trask does not approve of the Tanith Adventure 
instead of exporting robbery and murder to the Old Federationfor it Well  our operations are definable as robbery and murder 
And you object Perhaps you find me personally objectionableI dont care how many planets you raid or cities you sack  or howmany innocents  if thats what they are  you massacre in the OldFederation  You couldnt possibly do anything worse than thosepeople have been doing to one another for the past ten centuries What I object to is the way youre raiding the Sword-Worlds Youre crazy!
Young man 
Trask and myself  And when somebody makes a statement you dontunderstand  dont tell him hes crazy  Ask him what he means What do you mean  Lord Traskbest men  You raided me for close to forty vaqueros  farm-workers lumbermen  machine-operators  and I doubt Ill be able to replacethem with as good have you lost to Captain Harkamanescaping to space  like the atmosphere of a low-gravity planet each generation begotten by fathers slightly inferior to the last It wasnt so bad when the Space Vikings raided directly from theSword-Worlds; they got home once in a while  Now theyre conqueringplanets in the Old Federation for bases  and staying there Federation  and I know Space Vikings whose fathers were born onOld Federation planets gentleman isnt crazy  at all  Thats what happened to the TerranFederation  by the way  The good men all left to colonize  and thestuffed shirts and yes-men and herd-followers and safety-firstersstayed on Terra and tried to govern the galaxy Well  maybe this is all new to you  captain 
of the Sword-Worlds is an old song to the rest of us  I havetoo much to do to stay here and argue to sit here and build up population pressure like Terra in theFirst CenturyThey had that many on Terra alone  And it took us eight centuriesto reach that expanding three hundred and fifty years ago  when that ship cameback to Morglay from the Old Federation and reported what hadbeen happening out there since the Big War  Before that  we werediscovering new planets and colonizing them  Since then  wevebeen picking the bones of the dead Terran Federation Some drunk being bounced 
adventure; were not making any hit-and-run raid  Were taking overa whole planet; itll be another Sword-World in forty or fiftyyears Inside another century  well conquer the whole Federation 
What I dont understand 
Angus  Lord Trask  if you think the Tanith adventure is doing Gramso much harm make himself King of Gram  and I dont think anybody else could dothat  This planet needs a single sovereignty  I dont know how muchyouve seen of it outside this duchy  but dont take Wardshaven astypical  Some of these duchies  like Glaspyth or Didreksburg  areliteral snake pits  All the major barons are at each othersthroats  and they cant even keep their own knights and petty-baronsin order  Why  theres a miserable little war down in SouthmainContinent thats been going on for over two centuries Thats probably where Dunnans going to take that army of his 
Dunnan with it You dont have to go to Southmain; just go to Glaspyth 
planet will decivilize like anything in the Old Federation Oh  come  Lucas!
too far Yes  for one thing  we dont have the Neobarbarians 
Em-See-Square in nothing flat  Might be a good thing if theydid  too; it would stop us squabbling among ourselves Neobarbarians are  anyhowAttilas Huns in spaceshipsWell  isnt that who they are
Federation that still have hyperdrive  and theyre all civilized Thats if civilized is what Gilgamesh is homemade barbarians  Workers and peasants who revolted to seize anddivide the wealth and then found theyd smashed the means ofproduction and killed off all the technical brains  Survivors onplanets hit during the Interstellar Wars  from the Eleventh tothe Thirteenth Centuries  who lost the machinery of civilization Followers of political leaders on local-dictatorship planets Companies of mercenaries thrown out of employment and living bypillage  Religious fanatics following self-anointed prophets GramIf you do  take a look around 
recruited Yes 
instances  on a dozen and a half planets  in the last eightcenturies  of anti-technological movements  They had them on Terra back as far as the Second Century Pre-Atomic  And after Venusseceded from the First Federation  before the Second Federationwas organized Youre interested in history
aboard ship in hyperspace; boredom is the worst enemy  Myguns-and-missiles officer  Vann Larch  is a painter  Most of hiswork was lost with the Corisande on Durendal  but he kept us fromstarving a few times on Flamberge by painting pictures and sellingthem  My hyperspatial astrogator  Guatt Kirbey  composes music; hetries to express the mathematics of hyperspatial theory in musicalterms  I dont care much for it  myself history  You know  its odd; practically everything thats happenedon any of the inhabited planets happened on Terra before the firstspaceship Lets go 
the guests ought to find battle-stations  too

noble sir Make way  here!
Let these guards pass 
You lie!
teeth  all of you! Youve intercepted every message shes tried tosend me My daughter has sent you no messages  Lord Dunnan 
she wants nothing whatever to do with you only knows how youve been torturing her to force her into thisabominable marriage--Well  really! He actually is crazy!
Crazy  am I
Trask  he wants an interest in Karvall mills  and heres SesarKarvall  he wants access to iron deposits on Traskon land  Andmy loving uncle  he wants the help of both of them in stealingOmfray of Glaspyths duchy  And heres this loan-shark of a Ffayle trying to claw my lands away from me  and Rovard Grauffis  the fetchdogof my uncle who wont lift a finger to save his kinsman from ruin and this foreigner Harkaman whos swindled me out of command ofthe Enterprise  Youre all plotting against me--Sir Nevil 
himself  If youre a good friend to him  youll get him out of herebefore Duke Angus arrives Great Satan  are you against me  too
now--No  curse you  I wont go till Ive spoken to her  face to face--
Lord Dunnan  what do you wish to say to me
quickly and then go; you are not welcome here Elaine!
your head; why do you speak to me as a stranger I am Andray who loves you  Why are you letting them force you into thiswicked marriagehappily  because I love him  Now  please  go and make no moretrouble at my wedding him; they cant make you  Come with me now  They wont dare stopyou  Ill take you away from all these cruel  greedy people  Youlove me  youve always loved me  Youve told me you loved me again and again--hated you  either  but you are making it very hard for me not to Now go  and never let me see you again You lied to me!
Youre as bad as the rest of them  all scheming and plotting againstme  betraying me  I know what its about; you all want to cheat meof my rights  and keep my usurping uncle on the ducal throne  Andyou  you false-hearted harlot  youre the worst of them all!You two!
Help me  here  Get hold of him 
Lucas  hes crazy 
spoken fifty words to him since he came back from his last voyage--Sesar  You dont think  do you  that I need assurance of itCrazy  Ill say hes crazy 
hear what he said about his rights Wait till his Grace hearsabout that Does he lay claim to the ducal throne  Sir Rovard
Duke Angus and the true date of her birth falsified to give Angusthe succession  Why  his present Grace was three years old when shewas born  I was old Duke Fergus esquire; I carried Angus on myshoulder when Andray Dunnans mother was presented to the lordsand barons the day after she was born Of course hes crazy 
the Duke doesnt have him put under psychiatric treatment Id put him under treatment 
that ought to be deactivated  before they blow things up We couldnt do that 
nephew--I could do it 
this company of his  Why you people ever let him recruit them Satanonly knows ground-fighters  Id like to see how they shape up in combat  beforewe space out  I can have them ready for action in two hours  anditd be all over before midnight No  Captain Harkaman; his Grace would never permit it 
the independent lords on whom were counting for support  Youwerent here on Gram when Duke Ridgerd of Didreksburg had his sisterSancias second husband poisoned--

Elaine!
Elaine  where are you
Nikkolay; Andray Dunnan 
What happened to Elaine
Lucas 
Elaine     Elaine is dead 
she even felt the first one  She didnt suffer at all You were hit twice 
smashed the femur  And one in the chest  That one missed your heartby an inch Pity it did 
her down  and tried to cover her  I must have thrown her straightinto the burst and only caught the last of it myself Dunnan  Did they get him
took her off-planet I want to get him myself 
About the only thing we could do 
Sesar got shot  too No 
Was he killed
started  he went charging up the escalator  Didnt have anythingbut his dress-dagger  Dunnan gave him a quick burst; I think thatwas why he didnt have time to finish you off  By that time  theguards whod been shooting blanks from that rapid-fire gun got ina clip of live rounds and fired at him  He got out of there as fastas he could  They have Sesar on a robomedic like yours  He isntin any danger Youll be up and around in a few weeks 
seen to it that everything at Traskon New House will be ready foryou by then wouldnt be more than the next minute  That was to be Elaineshouse  I wont go to it alone He pirated the Enterprise 
that company of mercenaries of his  and hed bribed some of thepeople at the Gorram shipyards  I thought Alex would kill his chiefof security when he found out what had happened  We cant proveanything--were trying hard enough to--but were sure Omfray ofGlaspyth furnished the money  Hes been denying it just a shadetoo emphatically Then the whole thing was planned in advance 
before he started recruiting that company  I think he meant to doit the night before the wedding  Then he tried to persuade theLady-Demoiselle Elaine to elope with him--he seems to have actuallythought that was possible--and when she humiliated him  he decidedto kill both of you first at your word and accepting your offer  then How did he get hold of that Westlands Telecast and Teleprint car
office and told them he had the inside story on the marriage andwhy the Duke was sponsoring it  Made it sound as though there wassome scandal; insisted that a reporter come to Dunnan House for aface-to-face interview  They sent a man  and that was the last theysaw him alive; our people found his body at Dunnan House when wewere searching the place afterward  We found the car at theshipyard; it had taken a couple of hits from the guns at KarvallHouse  but you know what these press cars are built to stand  Hewent directly to the shipyard  where his men already had theEnterprise; as soon as he arrived  she lifted out Rovard  how soon will that second ship be finished
everything we had  The duchys on the edge of bankruptcy now  Westopped work on the second ship six months ago because we didnthave enough money to keep on with her and still get the Enterprisefinished  We were expecting the Enterprise to make enough in theOld Federation to finish the second one  Then  with two ships anda base on Tanith  the money would begin coming in instead of goingout  But now--It leaves me where I was on Flamberge 
King Napolyon was going to help the Elmersans  and Id have gottena command in that  Its too late for that now here on Gram  Thats if you dont mind commanding under me asowner-aboard  I am going hunting for Andray Dunnan Id count it an honor  Lord Trask  But where will you get a ship
Angus can finish her for me  and pay for it by pledging his newbarony of Traskon You mean  youll trade Traskon for that ship
Finished  equipped and ready for space  yes 
The Duke will agree to that 
Traskon is all you own If I have a ship  I wont need them  I am turning Space Viking 
Lucas Trask--Space Viking 
Now Ive heard everything 
That was another Lucas Trask  Rovard  Hes dead  now

pleasant to be a shipless captain living on strangers bounty Id hate  though  to have you think  some time  that Id advancedmy own fortunes at the expense of yours you are  I need a space-captain  and your misfortune is my owngood luck off Gram  at allA few years at the University of Camelot  on Excalibur  Otherwise  no 
yourself tofigures  that is  but do they mean anything to you I know theydont to a good many spacemen  even  We talk glibly about ten to thehundredth power  but emotionally we still count  One  Two  Three Many  A ship in hyperspace logs about a light-year an hour  Youcan go from here to Excalibur in thirty hours  But you could senda radio message announcing the birth of a son  and hed be a fatherbefore it was received  The Old Federation  where youre going tohunt Dunnan  occupies a space-volume of two hundred billion cubiclight-years  And youre hunting for one ship and one man in that How are you going to do it  Lord Traskdo it  There are planets in the Old Federation where Space Vikingscome and go; raid-and-trade bases  like the one Duke Angus plannedto establish on Tanith  At one or another of them  Ill pick up wordof Dunnan  sooner or later hell be gone for a year and a half to two years  Weve been raidingthe Old Federation for over three hundred years  Lord Trask  At present Id say there are at least two hundred Space Viking ships in operation Why havent we raided it bare long ago Well  thats the answer:distance and voyage-time  You know  Dunnan could die of old age--whichis not a usual cause of death among Space Vikings--before you caught upwith him  And your youngest ships-boy could die of old age before hefound out about it else that means anything to me life  I want a ship of my own  like the Corisande  that I lost onDurendal  Some day  Ill have one  But till you can command your ownship  Ill command her for you  Thats a promise You take it easy  Lucas 
damage-control work on you  and dont strain the machinery tillits fixed  We have plenty of time  Were not going to get anywherechasing Dunnan  The only way we can catch him is by interception The longer he moves around in the Old Federation before he hearswere after him  the more of a trail hell leave  Once we canestablish a predictable pattern  well have a chance  Then  sometime  hell come out of hyperspace somewhere and find us waitingfor him Do you think he went to Tanith
on Tanith  anyhow  You know the kind of a crew he has That gang arent even good enough for routine raiding 
on Tanith  Unless Dunnans completely crazy  which I doubt  hes goneto some regular Viking base planet  like Hoth or Nergal or Dagon orXochitl  to recruit officers and engineers and able spacemen to Tanith--was that aboard when he took the shipor Nergal or Xochitl  On a Viking-occupied planet in the OldFederation  that stuffs almost worth its weight in gold Whats Tanith like
like Haulteclere or Flamberge  It was one of the last planets theFederation colonized before the Big War  Nobody knows what happened exactly  There wasnt any interstellar war; at least  you dont findany big slag-puddles where cities used to be  They probably dida lot of fighting among themselves  after they got out of theFederation  Theres still some traces of combat-damage around  Thenthey started to decivilize  down to the pre-mechanical level--windand water power and animal power  They have draft-animals that looklike introduced Terran carabaos  and a few small sailboats and bigcanoes and bateaux on the rivers  They have gunpowder  which seemsto be the last thing any people lose        *       *       *       *       *All right  theyd try Xochitl first  Harkaman knew the planet and was friendly with the Haulteclere noble who ruled it The work went on at the Gorram shipyard; it had taken a yearto build the Enterprise  but the steel-mills and engine-workswere over the preparatory work of tooling up  and material andequipment was flowing in a steady stream  Lucas let them persuadehim to take more rest  and day by day grew stronger  Soon he wasspending most of his time at the shipyard  watching the enginesgo in--Abbot lift-and-drive for normal space  Dillingham hyperdrive power-converters  pseudograv  all at the center of the globular ship Living quarters and workshops went in next  all armored incollapsium-plated steel  Then the ship lifted out to an orbit athousand miles off-planet  followed by swarms of armored work-craftand cargo-lighters; the rest of the work was more easily done inspace  At the same time  the four two-hundred-foot pinnaces thatwould be carried aboard were being finished  Each of them had itsown hyperdrive engines  and could travel as far and as fast asthe ship herself Otto Harkaman was beginning to be distressed because the ship stilllacked a name  He didnt like having to speak of her as name-marked  Elaine  Trask thought  at once  and almost at oncerejected it  He didnt want her name associated with the thingsthat ship would do in the Old Federation  Revenge  Avenger Retribution  Vendetta; none appealed to him  A news-commentator turgidly eloquent about the nemesis which the criminal Dunnan hadinvoked against himself  supplied it  Nemesis it was Now he was studying his new profession of interstellar robbery andmurder against which he had once inveighed  Otto Harkamans handfulof followers became his teachers  Vann Larch  guns-and-missiles who was also a painter; Guatt Kirbey  sour and pessimistic  thehyperspatial astrogator who tried to express his science in music;Sharll Renner  the normal-space astrogator  Alvyn Karffard  theexec  who had been with Harkaman longest of all  And Sir PaytrikMorland  a local recruit  formerly guard-captain to Count Lionelof Newhaven  who commanded the ground-fighters and the combatcontragravity  They were using the farms and villages of Traskonfor drill and practice  and he noticed that while the Nemesiswould carry only five hundred ground and air fighters  over athousand were being trained He commented to Rovard Grauffis  the Dukes henchman said  
And Duke Angus would tax his new subjects of Glaspyth to redeemthe pledges on his new barony of Traskon  Some old Pre-Atomic writerHarkaman was fond of quoting had said         *       *       *       *       *The Nemesis came back to the Gorram yards and settled onto hercurved landing legs like a monstrous spider  The Enterprise hadborne the Ward sword and atom-symbol; the Nemesis should bear hisown badge  but the bisonoid head  tawny on green  of Traskon  was nolonger his  He chose a skull impaled on an upright sword  and it wasblazoned on the ship when he and Harkaman took her out for hershakedown cruise When they landed again at the Gorram yards  two hundred hours later they learned that a tramp freighter from Morglay had come intoBigglersport in their absence with news of Andray Dunnan  Hercaptain had come to Wardshaven at Duke Angus urgent invitationand was waiting for them at the Ducal Palace They sat  a dozen of them  around a table in the Dukes privateapartments  The freighter captain  a small  precise man with agraying beard  alternately puffed at a cigarette and sipped froma beaker of brandy  he was saying  
The room was still  The breeze fluttered curtains at the openwindows; from the garden below  winged night-things twittered [Illustration] Harkaman said

Pretty good  Guatt 
Good  Gehenna; it was perfect 
Oh  I suppose itll have to do 
made it a little closer  Need three microjumps  now  and Ill haveto cut the last one pretty fine  Now dont bother me Take it easy  Lucas 
control  We only think he might be here Im sure he is  He has to be 
disappointment  If we dont  and he is  its a disaster All right 
Jumping 
You know 
wasnt too bad  I think we can make it in one more microjump micro-
What do you think about it
Where should Guatt put us
As close as possible  of course 
nine hundred hours  By that time  he could have put in adetection-station  and maybe missile-launchers  on the moon  TheEnterprise carries four pinnaces  the same as the Nemesis; inhis place  Id have at least two of them on off-planet patrol  Solets accept it that well be detected as soon as we come out ofthe last jump  and come out with the moon directly between us andthe planet  If its occupied  we can knock it off on the way in by the planet Would you
the moon  they could launch at us in a curve around the planet  bydata relayed from the other side  and wed be at a disadvantagereplying  Just go straight in  You hearing this  Guattlook here a minute All right  jumping 
a million miles All yours  Sharll 
Eight hours to atmosphere 
to waste a lot of time shooting up Junior  there planetbuster  or four or five thermonuclears Have a good nap
Radio and screen signals  Not much  but some  The locals wouldnthave learned enough for that in the five years since I was here We didnt stay long enough  for one thing You didnt lose any men  did you
fifty hours  This were getting is outside stuff; somebodys therebeside the locals Is Paul getting anything new
Detection! Detection from planet! Radar  and microray!
Coming from a definite point  about twenty-fifth north parallel 
Theres nothing at all on the moon from the west Is she the Enterprise
Cant tell  yet 
in the screen! That spark  about thirty degrees north  just offthe west side detected!Shes calling us 
Interrogative: What ship are you Informative: her screencombination  Request: Please communicate All right 
Whats her screen-combinationto Tanith  Whos the gentleman with you He isnt the Duke ofWardshaven  is he
VIII

the Space Scourge youre in  I take it What are you doing hereon TanithThats Garvan Spasso  in the Lamia 
doing here  weve taken this planet over  We intend keeping it  too one another  And you have a little planet  all your very own  Im sohappy for both of you  What are you getting out of it--beside poultryTanith is our planet  You think you can take it away from usI know we could  and so do you 
and Spasso together; why  a couple of our pinnaces could knock theLamia apart  The only question is  do we want to botherThen the Enterprise didnt come here at all!
Isnt that the Enterprise youre in
Oh  no  Pardon my remissness  Captain Valkanhayn 
Lucas Trask  is owner-aboard  for whom I am commanding  Lord Trask Captain Boake Valkanhayn  of the Space Scourge  Captain Valkanhaynis a Space Viking ship is approaching  You mean to tell me that the Enterprisehasnt been hereYou mean the Duke of Wardshaven has two ships
As far as I know  the Duke of Wardshaven hasnt any ships 
of Lord Trask  The Enterprise  for which we are looking  is ownedand commanded by one Andray Dunnan a base That was what wed heard  We heard youd gone from Flambergeto Gram to command for him Where did you hear this And when
brought the news from Xochitl good enough  when it was fresh  It was a year and a half old whenyou got it  though  How long have you been here on TanithAbout a thousand hours 
Boake  Say hello to Garvan for me when he comes up You mean youre not staying
Youre just spacing right out again
Enterprise has obviously gone somewhere else  She was still inhyperspace when Captain Valkanhayn and his accomplice arrived here Is there anything worth staying for
Beside poultry  that is
and Captain Spassos  Let them be stuck with it ten or twenty thousand people; temples and palaces and everything Then  there are a couple of old Federation cities  The one were atis in good shape  and theres a big spaceport  Weve been doinga lot of work on it  And the locals wont give you any trouble All they have is spears and a few crossbows and matchlocks--I know  Ive been here 
Well  couldnt we make some kind of a deal
get Garvan on screen and switch him over to your ship--Well  we have a lot of Sword-World merchandise aboard 
fixed for robotic equipmentBut arent you going to stay here
on this  Just excuse me for a minute--The humor escapes me 
We came here on a fools errand 
Im sorry  Lucas 
its a letdown  but that pair of chiseling chicken thieves! I couldalmost pity them  if it werent so funny know what their idea wasWho are they
like Set and Hertha and Melkarth  where the locals havent anythingto fight with--or anything worth fighting for  I didnt know theydteamed up  but that figures  Nobody else would team up with eitherof them  What must have happened  this story of Duke Angus Tanithadventure must have filtered out to them  and they thought that ifthey got here first  Id think it was cheaper to take them in thanrun them out  I probably would have  too  They do have ships  of asort  and they do raid  after a fashion  But now  there isnt goingto be any Tanith base  and they have a no-good planet and theyrestuck with it Cant they make anything out of it themselves
Like what
no men  Not for a job like that  The only thing they can do is spaceout and forget it We could sell them equipment 
thing  we do want to let down and give the men a chance to walk onground and look at a sky for a while  The girls here arent too bad either bath  now and then wed get to where hes been reported  hed be a couple of thousandlight-years away the men a chance to get off the ship  here  We can stall this pairalong for a while and we wont have any trouble with them Just holding ships meetings 
back and forth for a couple of hours  yet Yes; Valkanhayn and Spasso dont own their ships 
maintenance till everybody owns everything in common  The shipslook like it  too  They dont even command  really; they justpreside over elected command-councils the Duke of Wardshaven at all Thats correct 
thought another Gram ship  the Enterprise  would be here  Sinceshe isnt  theres no point in our being here  We do hope  though that you wont make any difficulty about our letting down and givingour men a couple of hundred hours liberty  Theyve been inhyperspace for three thousand hours See!
He wants to trick us into letting him land--
Captain Spasso 
everybodys intelligence  your own included going to do here  You expected Captain Harkaman here to establish abase for the Duke of Wardshaven  and you thought  if you were hereahead of him and in a posture of defense  that hed take you intothe Dukes service rather than waste ammunition and risk damage andcasualties wiping you out  Well  Im very sorry  gentlemen  CaptainHarkaman is in my service  and Im not in the least interested inestablishing a base on Tanith I get it!
Enterprise and this one  The Duke of Wardshaven fitted out theEnterprise  and somebody else fitted out this one  They both wantto put in a base here!Why  sure you can land  Otto 
like to be three thousand hours in hyper  myself youabout midnight there now  Hows the spaceport When I was here  itwas pretty bad Oh  weve been fixing it up  We got a big gang of locals working for us--
of jobs  to keep a civilization running  Smash the installations andkill the top technicians and scientists  and the masses dont knowhow to rebuild and go back to stone hatchets  Kill off enough of themasses and even if the planet and the know-how is left  theresnobody to do the work  Ive seen planets that decivilized both ways Tanith  I think  is one of the latter But some of them survived  Dont they know what happened
buildings by wizard arts  Then the sorcerers fought among themselvesand went away Thats all they know about it 
I dont envy the poor buggers 
Spasso have probably made slaves of the lot of them  If I was reallygoing to put in a base here  I wouldnt thank that pair for thekind of public-relations work theyve been doing among the locals 
IX

that were any good for work here; we gathered the rest up at villagesalong the big river How do you get food for them
Or dont you bother
Oh  we gather that up all over 
parties out with landing craft  Theyll let down on a village  runthe locals out  gather up whats around and bring it here  Once ina while they put up a fight  but the best they have is a few crossbowsand some muzzle-loading muskets  When they do  we burn the villageand machine-gun everybody we see Thats the stuff 
be milked  just shoot her  Of course  you dont get much milk out ofher again  but--Pick all this stuff up off the locals
river where we recruited the fellows were using to boss the workers come!for the work they do or for the things you take from them any kind of a mess out of it you want to You think we ought to pay them
bunch of savages!took it over  Youve been there; youve seen what Prince Viktor doeswith them now We havent got the men or equipment they have on Xochitl 
We cant afford to coddle the locals 
You cant afford not to 
here  You can only use one for raiding; the other will have to stayhere to hold the planet  If you take them both away  the locals whom you have been studiously antagonizing  will swamp whoever youleave behind  And if you dont leave anybody behind  whats the useof having a planetary baseWell  why dont you join us 
With our three ships we could have a real thing  here 
The gentlemen 
usWell  if you want to put it like that 
admit  your Nemesis would be the big end of it  But why not Threeships  we could have a real base here  Nikky Grathams father onlyhad two when he started on Jagannath  and look what the Grathams gotthere now Are we interested
have great possibilities  Suppose we reserve decision for a whileand look around a little Have your fill of Space Viking glamour  Lucas
For the moment  Im told that this lot arent typical 
with it Valkanhayn are a pair of ignominious little crooks  and stupid alongwith it  If Andray Dunnan had gotten here ahead of us  he might havedone one good thing in his wretched life  I cant understand why hedidnt come here I think he still will 
Nevil Ormm  Ormms ambitious  and Dunnan is insanely vindictive--Im telling you that!
Why didnt he come here directly  then
constructive; Dunnans a destroyer  I think he took that cargo ofequipment somewhere and sold it  I think hell wait till hes fairlysure the other ship is finished  Then hell come in and shoot theplace up  the way--The way he did my wedding; I think of it all the time 
to contragravity and nuclear energy gunpowder  for one thing  and I can think of some rather impressiveOld Terran civilizations that didnt have that much  They have anorganized society  and anybody who has that is starting towardcivilization Valkanhayn stay here long are often tough while theyre happening  I know whatll happen toSpasso and Valkanhayn  though  Theyll start decivilizing  themselves Theyll stay here for a while  and when they need something theycant take from the locals theyll go chicken-stealing after it but most of the time theyll stay here lording it over their slaves and finally their ships will wear out and they wont be able to fixthem  Then  some time  the localsll jump them when they arentwatching and wipe them out  But in the meantime  the localslllearn a lot from them You know 
Im going to let Spasso and Valkanhayn persuade me to take thisplanet away from them You crazy or something
him hes crazy  Ask him what he means  Who said thatOn target 
What do you mean  Lord Trask
interception  You know the source of that quotation  too  This looksto me like a good place to intercept him  When he learns I have abase here  hell hit it  sooner or later  And even if he doesnt we can pick up more information on him  when ships start coming inhere  than we would batting around all over the Old Federation up a base like Nergal or Xochitl five ships  Space Vikings  traders  Gilgameshers and so on  oneither of those planets all the time  If we had the cargo Dunnantook to space in the Enterprise  we could start a base like that But we havent anything near what we need  and you know what Spassoand Valkanhayn have Adventure  from Duke Angus down  lost everything they put into it If theyre willing to throw some good money after bad  they can getit back  and a handsome profit to boot  And there ought to beplanets above the rowboat and ox-cart level not too far away thatcould be raided for a lot of things wed need They wont be the kind Spasso and Valkanhayn are in the habit ofraiding  though  And besides machinery  we can get gold  and valuablemerchandise that could be sold on Gram  And if we could make a go ofit  youd go farther hunting Dunnan by sitting here on Tanith than bygoing looking for him  That was the way we used to hunt marsh pigs onColada  when I was a kid; just find a good place and sit down and wait I believe  together  we could really make something out of this planet 
Thats what weve been telling you  all along 
This is a wonderful planet--
spaceport  for one thing Well  whats this  here
It was a spaceport 
wed need a shipyard  capable of any kind of heavy repair work Capable of building a complete ship  in fact  I never saw a shipcome into a Viking base planet with any kind of a cargo worthdickering over that hadnt taken some damage getting it  PrinceViktor of Xochitl makes a good half of his money on ship repairs and so do Nikky Gratham on Jagannath and the Everrards on Hoth And engine works  hyperdrive  normal space and pseudograv 
robotic-equipment works  and--Oh  thats out of all reason!
twenty trips with a ship the size of this one to get all that stuffhere  and howd we ever be able to pay for itEnterprise  practically a duplicate of the Nemesis  carriedeverything that would be needed to get it started  when she waspirated When she was--
Now youre going to have to tell the gentlemen the truth 
I intend to 
larger plan; Angus wanted to gain economic supremacy for Wardshavento forward his political ambitions  It was  however  an entirelypractical business proposition  I was opposed to it  because Ithought it would be too good a proposition for Tanith and work tothe disadvantage of the home planet in the end the project  What did annoy me  to put it mildly  was that justbefore he took the ship out  Dunnan shot up my wedding  wounded meand my father-in-law  and killed the lady to whom I had been marriedfor less than half an hour  I fitted out this ship at my ownexpense  took on Captain Harkaman  who had been left without acommand when the Enterprise was pirated  and came out here tohunt Dunnan down and kill him  I believe that I can do that best byestablishing a base on Tanith myself  The base will have to beoperated at a profit  or it cant be operated at all join me as partners finance it Tanith adventure will put it up  Its the only way they can recoverwhat they lost on the Enterprise But then  this Duke of Wardshaven will be running it  not us 
The Duke of Wardshaven 
here on Tanith  There are three thousand light-years between Well have to hold a meeting of all three crews 
We will do nothing of the kind 
things here on Tanith  You people may allow your orders to bedebated and voted on  but I dont  You will inform your respectivecrews to that effect  Any orders you give them in my name will beobeyed without argument I dont know how the menll take that 
I know how theyll take it if theyre smart 
running your ships  or how your ships crews have been running you Well  we dont do it that way  Lucas Trask is owner  and Imcaptain  I obey his orders on whats to be done  and everybody elseobeys mine on how to do it wants it  Boake  You want to give him an argument I dont The first order 
working here are to be paid  They are not to be beaten by theseplug-uglies you have guarding them  If any of them want to leave they may do so; they will be given presents and furnishedtransportation home  Those who wish to stay will be issued rations furnished with clothing and bedding and so on as they need it  andpaid wages  Well work out some kind of a pay-token system and setup a commissary where they can buy things anything else  We will pay for anything we get from any of thelocals Well have trouble about that 
think anything a local has belongs to anybody who can take it So do I 
planet  and our locals  We dont raid our own planet or our ownpeople  Youll just have to teach them that 
X

taking somebodys livery-and-maintenance cant use too much pressure; make them think its their own idea We arent going to spend our time sitting here on Tanith 
the operative word  And we are not going to raid easy planets  Aplanet that can be raided with impunity isnt worth the time it takesgetting to it  We are going to have to fight on every planet we hit and I am not going to jeopardize the lives of the men under me which includes your crews as well as mine  because of under-poweredand under-armed ships Weve been getting along 
chicken-stealing on planets like Set and Xipototec and Melkarth  Notmaking enough to cover maintenance expenses; thats why your shipsin the shape she is  Well  those days are over  Both ships ought tohave a full overhaul  but well have to skip that till we have ashipyard of our own  But I will insist  at least  that your guns andlaunchers are in order  And your detection equipment; you didnt geta fix on the Nemesis till we were less than twenty thousand milesoff-planet We had better get the Lamia in condition first 
can put her on off-planet watch  instead of that pair of pinnaces You know how that ships run
of officers; chief engineer  exec  guns-and-missiles  astrogator andso on  Spassos just an animated ventriloquists dummy  I talked toall of them  None of them can pin me down to anything  but theythink were going to heave Spasso out of command and appoint one ofthem  and each one thinks hell be it  I dont know how long thatlllast  its a string-and-tape job like the one were having to do onthe ship  Itll hold till we get something better Well have to get rid of Spasso 
put one of our own people in his place  Valkanhayn can stay incommand of the Space Scourge; hes a spaceman  But Spassos nogood for anything first  and make a big raid Space Scourge back to Gram empty  When Baron Rathmore and LordValpry and the rest of them talk to Duke Angus and the Tanithinvestors  theyll have to have a lot more than some travel filmsof Tanith  Theyll have to be able to show that Tanith is producing We ought to have a little money of our own to invest  too But  Otto; both ships
and finds nobody here but Spasso and the Lamiayear and a half before Dunnan shows up here  I know  we were fooledtrying to guess what hed do before  But the sort of raid I have inmind  well need two ships  and in any case  I dont want to leaveboth those ships here while were gone  even if you do trust Spasso here alone  can weAlvyn--thatll mean a lot of work for me that hed otherwise do on the ship  And Baron Rathmore  and young Valpry  and the menwhove been training our sepoys  We can shuffle things around andleave some of Valkanhayns men in place of some of Spassos  We mighteven talk Spasso into going along  Thatll mean having to endure himat our table  but it would be wise Have you picked a place to raid
here  That wont amount to much; just chicken-stealing  Itll giveour green hands some relatively safe combat-training  and itll giveus some idea of how Spassos and Valkanhayns people behave  andgive them confidence for the next job And then
old  A lot of things can happen in twenty years  All I know of it--Iwas never there myself--is its fairly civilized--about like Terrajust before the beginning of the Atomic Era  No nuclear energy  theylost that  and of course nothing beyond it  but they have hydroelectricand solarelectric power  and nonnuclear jet aircraft  and some very goodchemical-explosive weapons  which they use very freely on each other It was last known to have been raided by a ship from Excaliburtwenty years ago That sounds promising  And the third planet
difference there  but if we saved Amaterasu for last  we mightbe needing too many repairs Its like that
mention Beowulf to Captains Spasso and Valkanhayn  Wait till wevehit Khepera and Amaterasu  They may be feeling like heroes  then 
XI

That was a good one; that was a good one!
five days  and all the stuff we gathered up around them  We tookover two million stellars Knock it off  Spasso  You said that before 
Who do you think you are--
He thinks hes Lord Trask of Tanith 
too; he is pop your mouth about a lousy two million stellars  Nearer a millionand a half  but two millions nothing to pop about  Maybe it wouldbe for the Lamia  but we have a three-ship fleet and a planetarybase to meet expenses on  Out of this raid  a ground-fighter or anable spaceman will get a hundred and fifty stellars  Well get abouta thousand  ourselves  How long do you think we can stay in businessdoing this kind of chicken-stealing You call this chicken-stealing
Tanith  If you live that long Well  you saw the elephant  Lucas 
to have liked it Elephant
elephant was an animal about the size of one of your Gram megatheres The expression means  experiencing something for the first timewhich makes a great impression  Elephants must have been somethingto see  This was your first Viking raid  Youve seen it  now They dont have a chance 
fighting Yes; stupid of them  isnt it
What would you do in their place
me  Terro-humans are all stupid like that  Thats why were human Poor devil 
No 
Great Satan  Lucas! Why did you do that
I wish Andray Dunnan had done that for me 
he had  How many more happinesses do you think weve smashed heretoday And we dont even have Dunnans excuse of madness It was a filthy business 
ask me who said that Space Vikings are professional robbers andmurderers  but who was it said that he didnt care how many planetswere raided and how many innocents massacred in the Old FederationA dead man  Lucas Trask of Traskon 
You wish  now  that youd kept Traskon and stayed on Gram
Im doing now  I can get used to this  I suppose my first raid  and had bad dreams about it for a year rest  for a couple of hours  Then draw some alcodote-vitamin pillsfrom the medic  As soon as things are secured  therell be partiesall over the ship  and well be expected to look in on every one ofthem  have a drink  and say Well done  boys 
XII

They got radio  and they got radar 
Well  so what
years ago  when Rock Morgan was here in the Coalsack  But theydont have nuclear energy  do theybut nothing nuclear with a gun can lick half a dozen with clubs  And two ships withnuclear weapons can lick a whole planet without them  Think itstime  LucasPaul  can you cut in on that Eglonsby station yet
What are you going to do
and then we will pick out another city and summon it to surrender I dont think the second one will refuse  If we are going to bemurderers  well do it right  this time Neobarbs a lesson--Eglonsby  Space Vikings    Vann 
four miles over the city Communicate at once Will you hold your fire until somebody in authority can communicatewith you This is the chief operator at the central State telecaststation; I have no authority to say anything to you  or discussanything Oh  good  that sounds like a dictatorship 
everything surrender the city to us  If this is not done within the hour the city and everybody in it will be obliterated the Council of Syndics  We will switch President Pedrosan over assoon as he can speak directly to the personage in supreme commandof your ships That is myself; switch him to me at once 
lives and destruction of property You dont begin to  Do you know anything about nuclear weapons
fissionables on this planet Eglonsby and for a radius of almost a hundred miles  Are you stillprepared to resistI have all powers in any emergency  I think 
automatically ratify any decision I make dictatorship  with parliamentary false front If he isnt a false-front dictator for some oligarchy 
How large is this Council
Syndicate of Labor  the Syndicate of Manufacturers  the Syndicateof Small Businesses  the    Corporate State  First Century Pre-Atomic on Terra  Benny the Moose 
Lets all go down and talk to them 
contragravity  For winged aircraft powered by chemical fuel  I hopewe have time for me to look around  here  Ill bet they even haverailroads here great damage
Lord Trask  will you deal with these people directly
Certainly  Admiral 
expect complete submission  As long as you remain submissive to us we will do no damage beyond removal of the things we wish to takefrom it  and there will be no violence to any of your people  or anyindiscriminate vandalism  This visit we are paying you will cost youheavily  make no mistake about that  but whatever the cost  it willbe a cheap price for avoiding what we might otherwise do You understand  we want maximum value and minimum bulk 
luxury goods of all kinds  Rare-element metals  And monetary metals gold and platinum  You have a metallic-based currency  I supposeOh  no!
is based on services to society  Our monetary unit is simply calleda credit Gold  to some extent  for jewelry 
And platinum in industry  of course 
If they want gold  they should have raided Stolgoland 
They have a gold-standard currency 
Stolgoland doesnt seem to appear on them I wish it didnt appear on ours  either 
decided to raid them instead of us It isnt too late for these gentlemen to make that decision 
peoplethe Stolgonian currency  The actual currency is paper  theoreticallyredeemable in gold  In actuality  the circulation of gold has beenprohibited  and the entire gold wealth of the nation is concentratedin vaults at three depositories  We know exactly where they are You begin to interest me  President Pedrosan 
You have nuclear weapons  something nobody on this planet has  Youhave contragravity  something that is hardly more than a legendhere  On the other hand  we have a million and a half ground-troops jet aircraft  armored ground-vehicles  and chemical weapons  If youwill undertake to attack Stolgoland  we will place this entire forceat your disposal; General Dagró will command them as you direct  Allthat we ask is that  when you have loaded the gold hoards ofStolgoland aboard your ships  you will leave our troops inpossession of the country along with it What
them by surprise  It will be nothing but plain self-defense been plotting to attack us for years Eglonsby  they would have invaded us the moment your ships liftedout  Its exactly what Id do in their place But you maintain nominally friendly relations with them
of Eglonsby    Yes  Mr  President; I understand  And they have an embassy here
They call it that!
a plague-spot of espionage and subversion   !Well grab that ourselves  right away 
able to round up all their agents outside it  and if we tried to  itwould cause suspicion  Well have to put up a front to deceive them collaborate with us  and you will specifically order your troopsmobilized to assist us in collecting the tribute we are levying onEglonsby your troops concentrated around our landing craft  theyll thinkits to help us load our loot military equipment and tanks are being loaded on your contragravity vehicles Is this how you Space Vikings keep faith
sacking Eglonsby  You promised to leave Eglonsby alone if I helpedyou get the gold of Stolgoland Stolgoland  Youve taken it unnecessary damage or violence  Ive already hanged a dozen of myown men for rape  murder and wanton vandalism  Now  we expect to beout of here in twenty-four hours  Youd better be back here beforethen  Your own people are starting to loot  We did not promise tocontrol them for you Id do  if Id gotten myself into a mess like that  Hell probablybring half his army back  leave the other half in Stolgoland  andlose both  Suppose we drop in  in about three or four years  justout of curiosity  If we make twenty per cent of what we did thistime  the trip would pay for itself 
XIII

No  we did not 
out of Tanith  were going to need power  and I dont mean windmillsand waterwheels  As youve remarked  Beowulf has nuclear energy Thats where we get our plutonium and our power units There are  or were  three chief sources of fissionable ores 
Kintours Princess of Lyonesse  sixty years ago  He hit one on theAntarctic continent; according to his account  everything there wasfairly new  He didnt mess things up too badly  and it ought to bestill operating  Well go in from the south pole  and well have togo in fast one of our boys did that who launched it; get his name!sunrise line  Thats where those missiles are coming from Thats it 
Ship secure 
can call that chicken-stealing Gram gum-pear brandy youre putting in that coffee Ill have thesame  Just leave out the coffee

You know whatll happen
cargo  and thatll be the last any of usll hear of him again  Hellprobably take it to Joyeuse or Excalibur and buy himself a lordshipwith it along--Guatt Kirbey will be the astrogator; youd trust him wouldnt you And Sir Paytrik Morland  and Baron Rathmore  andLord Valpry  and Rolve Hemmerding    Space Scourge  tooGood  Then well be sure nothing crooked is pulled 
when you get to Gram  And ask Duke Angus  as a favor to give himsome meaningless position with a suitably impressive title  LordChamberlain of the Ducal Washroom  or something  Then he can primehim with misinformation and give him an opportunity to sell it toOmfray of Glaspyth  Then  of course  he could be contacted to sellOmfray out to Angus  A couple of times around and somebodyll sticka knife in him  and then well be rid of him for good Of course  we could go ahead with it  now 
of a reaction plant to make sure nobody else tries to take the ship  And I reallybelieve  now  that Valkanhayn can be trusted But we dont know whats been happening on Gram  Glaspyth andDidreksburg could have teamed up and jumped Wardshaven beforeDuke Angus was ready to invade Glaspyth  Boake might be landingthe ship in a trap at Wardshaven first time in history that a Sword-World was raided by Space Vikings in over to this screen about two light-seconds away in a few minutes Prince Trask; Count Harkaman 
thirty-two hundred hours out of Wardshaven on Gram  Baron Valkanhayncommanding  accompanied by chartered freighter Rozinante  Durendal Captain Morbes  Requesting permission and instructions to orbit in Baron Valkanhayn
Thats right 
size of a blanket to prove it  I have a whole cargo of scrolls  Onesays youre Otto  Count Harkaman  and another says youre Admiral ofthe Royal Navy of Gram He did it!
He made himself King of Gram!
Trask  and Viceroy of his Majestys Realm of Tanith of Tanith Is his Majesty making it worth while to accept his sovereignty
That is  beside vellum scrolls
down  And wait till you see whats crammed into the other ship Did Spasso come back with you
Angus  He is Chief of Police at Glaspyth  now  and nobody can callwhat hes doing there chicken-stealing  either  Any chickens hesteals  he steals the whole farm to get them The Space Scourge stopped that 
the base here  and saw what wed shipped to Gram  they startedchanging their minds  Only subjects of King Angus will be allowedto invest in the Tanith Adventure his profitMy business out here is Andray Dunnan 
Oh  yes 
many words  that he would be most happy if you sent him his nephewshead in a block of lucite  What Dunnan did touched his honor  too Sovereign princes never see any humor in things like that Tanithyou see the defense armament were bringing  youll think he does

back  but we didnt want to send the Rozinante back empty One thing  I had time to do a little reading  between stops 
The books from the Eglonsby library
planet was so extensively colonized by the Federation  when theredont seem to be any fissionable ores The planet produced gadolinium Theres only one thing its good for  and you cant run a spaceshipon Diesel oil  I suppose the mines could be reopened  and newrefineries built  but    own  We could charge our own prices for it  and we wouldnt need totell them what gadolinium sells for on the Sword-Worlds we did to Eglonsby and Stolgoland  Where would we get plutoniumhave everything elseBy Satan  thats it!
plutonium and Beowulf gadolinium  are youWhy not We could make a big profit on both ends of the deal 
both planets all over the place in a few years  We want that likewe want a hole in the head Have you ever heard of a Space Viking ship named the Enterprise
Andray Dunnan year ago Chermosh to trade  This ship sacked the city in which they were;some of them lost heavily in worlds goods Thats a pity 
It is as Yah the Almighty wills 
and worshipers of false gods  The Space Vikings looted their templeand destroyed it utterly; they carried away the graven images andabominations  Our people bore witness that there was much wailingand lamentation among the idolators Almost two years ago  on Jagannath 
on orbit there  getting some light repairs  I met the man a fewtimes  Looks just like those pictures  but hes wearing a smallpointed beard  now  Hed sold a lot of loot  General merchandise precious and semiprecious stones  a lot of carved and inlaidfurniture that looked as though it had come from some Neobarb kingspalace  and some temple stuff  Buddhist; there were a couple of biggold Dai-Butsus  His crew were standing drinks for all comers  Someof them were pretty dark above the collar  as though theyd been ona hot-star planet not too long before  And he had a lot of Imhotepfurs to sell  simply fabulous stuff What kind of repairs Combat damage
after I came in  in company with another ship  The Starhopper Captain Teodor Vaghn  The talk was that they were making a two-shipraid somewhere cartridges to hellburners  And he was buying all the air-and-waterrecycling equipment  and all the carniculture and hydroponicequipment  he could get Did he know  at the time  that Im out here hunting for him
myself  till six months afterward That checks with the Gilgameshers story He got the furs on Imhotep; he traded for them 
middle of a glaciation  the land surface down to the fiftiethparallel is iced over solid  There is one city  ten or fifteenthousand  and the rest of the population is scattered around insettlements of a couple of hundred all along the face of theglaciers  Theyre all hunters and trappers  They have somecontragravity  and when a ship comes in  they spread the news byradio and everybody brings his furs to town  They use telescopesights  and everybody over ten years old can hit a man in the headat five hundred yards  And big weapons are no good; theyre too welldispersed  So the only way to get anything out of them is to tradefor it I think I know where he was 
silver is a monetary metal  On Agni  they use silver for sewer-pipe Agni is a hot-star planet  class B-3 sun  And on Agni they aretough  and they have good weapons  That could be where theEnterprise took that combat damage It doesnt tell us anything  either way 
is away off to the side from Agni and Imhotep in either case Terra-type planet with all that air-and-water and hydroponic and carniculture stuffWhat sort of a captain is this Teodor Vaghn
one he knows his business and he has a good ship and a well-trainedcrew  You think he and Dunnan have teamed upa fleet together Hell know were after him by now 
where we are  and that puts him one up on us

wont look for any with me Burrik had his base  First  there was a trading ship came in  Youmay have heard of her; she is the one called the Honest Horris Honest Horris 
He had been to Melkarth before 
Burrik are friends of the Fairdealer was that the Honest Horris was landed besideBurriks ship for ten days  when two other ships came in  They saidone had the blue crescent badge  and the other bore a green monsterleaping from one star to another There was a great feast  of all four crews  Then everything ofvalue was loaded aboard the Fortuna  and all four ships liftedand spaced out together  They said Burrik left nothing of any worthwhatever behind; they were much disappointed at that Have any of them been back since
before his ship put in there  He could still see where the landinglegs of the ships had pressed into the ground  but the locals saidthey had not been back Look  Rovard 
in  didnt you Thats what happens to a ship that raids a planetwhere theres anything worth taking  Beowulf is lousy withfissionables; theyll give us all the plutonium we can load  inexchange for gadolinium  which we sell them at about twiceSword-World prices  We trade plutonium on Amaterasu for gadolinium and get it for about half Sword-World prices quote me as saying that whoever has advised His Majesty that thatisnt good business is no friend to His Majesty or to the Realm He wondered why His Majesty didnt stop Lionel of Newhaven fromsending the Blue Comet out from Gram  He found out from herskipper  the next time she came in        *       *       *       *       *The captain of the Blue Comet  who was one of Count Lionelsvassal barons  was silent for a moment  he said  
The unfortunate grandfather of Duke Angus had always been a subjectnice people avoided  The unfortunate grandfather of King Angus wasprobably a subject everybody who valued their necks avoided Lothar Ffayle had also come out on the Blue Comet  He was just asoutspoken Ffayle nodded  Ffayle nodded again  Well  that was understandable  One of the ships that made theshuttle-trip to Gram would carry enough in her strong rooms  in goldand jewels and the like  to pay a handsome profit on the voyage  Thebulk-goods that went into the cargo holds was practically taking afree ride  so anything on hand  stuff that nobody would ordinarilythink of shipping in interstellar trade  went aboard  A two thousandfoot freighter had a great deal of cargo space Baron Trask of Traskon hadnt even begun to realise what Tanith basewas going to cost Gram [Illustration][Illustration]

You see what you did  now
were making a customer; what you made was a competitor need a fleet to take it  A couple of Beowulf ships would help  Youknow them; you fought them  too How did they take it
Space Vikings  not Gilgameshers  I told him we werent Gilgameshers either  as hed find out on Xochitl the next time one of his shipsraided one of our planets  Are you going to back me up Of course you can always send Prince Viktor my head  and an apology--and a planet full of hellburners  You did perfectly right  Otto;exactly what Id have done in your place subject  Lucas  Prince and Viceroy of Tanith; we consider ourselvesvery badly served by Prince Trask  We therefore command him to returnto Gram  and render to us account of his administration of our colonyand realm of Tanith We  Lucas  Prince of Tanith 
acknowledge the suzerainty of the King of Gram  formerly Duke ofWardshaven  It is our earnest desire  if possible  to remain atpeace and friendship with the King of Gram  and to carry on traderelations with him and with his subjects --dammit  hed said 
of some other word--       *       *       *       *       *Three months later  the next ship  which had left Gram while KingAngus summons was still in hyperspace  brought Baron Rathmore Shaking hands with him as he left the landing craft  Trask wanted toknow if hed been sent out as the new Viceroy  Rathmore started tolaugh and ended by cursing vilely  Trask corrected  
said  Rathmore had lowered his voice  but even so the open landing stagewas no place for this sort of talk  He said so  ordered a coupleof the locals to collect Rathmores luggage  and got him into ahall-car  taking him down to his living quarters  After they werein private  Rathmore began again:Trask stiffened  he asked softly Rathmores mouth opened slightly  The girls name meant nothing to Trask; he did know of her father  aBaron Valdiva  He was lord of a small estate south of the Ward landsand west of Newhaven  Most of his people were out-and-out banditsand cattle-rustlers  and he was as close to being one himself ashe could get Flavias brother  He shook his head  Rathmore shrugged   he said  
       *       *       *       *       *The captain of the free Space Viking Damnthing was namedRoger-fan-Morvill Esthersan  which meant that he was someSword-Worlders acknowledged bastard by a woman of one of the OldFederation planets  His mothers people could have been Nergalers;he had coarse black hair  a mahogany-brown skin  and red-brown almost maroon  eyes  He tasted the wine the robot poured for himand expressed appreciation  then began unwrapping the parcel hehad brought in It was an automatic pistol  with a belt and holster  The leather wasbisonoid-hide; the buckle of the belt was an oval enameled with acrescent  pale blue on black  The pistol was a plain 10-mm militarymodel with grooved plastic grips; on the receiver it bore the stampof the House of Hoylbar  the firearms manufacturers of Glaspyth Evidently it was one of the arms Duke Omfray had provided for AndrayDunnans original mercenary company previous report from that planet  That was practically sizzling hot  Well  something like that had tohappen  sooner or later  The Space Viking was asking him if he knewwhat sort of a place Tetragrammaton was Neobarbarian  trying to recivilize in a crude way  Small population concentrated on one continent; farming and fisheries  A little heavyindustry  in a small way  at a couple of towns  They had some nuclearpower  introduced a century or so ago by traders from Marduk  one ofthe really civilized planets  They still depended on Marduk forfissionables; their export product was an abominably-smellingvegetable oil which furnished the base for delicate perfumes  andwhich nobody was ever able to synthesize properly Space Viking said  he said  touching the pistol         *       *       *       *       *They played off the tapes that evening  They werent particularlyinformative  The locals who had been interrogated hadnt been inactual contact with Dunnans people except in combat  The man whohad been carrying the 10-mm Hoylbar was the best witness of the lot and he knew little  He had caught one of them alone  shot him frombehind with a shotgun  taken his pistol  and then gotten away asquickly as he could  They had sent down landing craft  it seemed and said they wanted to trade; then something must have happened nobody knew what  and they had begun a massacre and sacked the town After returning to their ships  they had opened fire with nuclearmissiles  Hugh Rathmore said in disgust  
 Boake Valkanhayn said  
 Harkaman frowned  
[Illustration]acknowledged bastard of somebody named Morvill said   Trask agreed  
demanded  Baron Rathmore started to say something about what Andray Dunnanwas crazy enough to do  and what his uncle was crazy enough to do It was just one of the cracks he had been making since hed cometo Tanith and didnt have to look over his shoulder while he wasmaking them  Trask said  
Rathmore cried  Harkaman had stopped being incredulous  
passion for Elaine; he pushed that thought hastily from him  himself by adding  There was a time when he had dreaded the possibility that somebodyelse might kill Dunnan before he could 
XVIII

They bombed and strafed the little farm-towns and villages  Theyscattered radioactives that killed as many as the bombing  And afterthey had gone away  this other ship came The Damnthing She bore the head of a beast with three very big horns
captain found out what had happened to us  he left some food andmedicines for us We can give you a little equipment  Just remember it of us  whenyoure back on your feet; well be back to trade later  But dontthink you owe us anything  The man who did this to you is my enemy Now  I want to talk to every one of your people who can tell meanything at all    We dont even know Dunnan did it  personally 
nobody ever heard of  sitting on a golden throne  surrounded by a harem spend all my time on Tanith  Say we try Audhumla next  Its thefarthest away  We might get there while hes still shooting upObidicut and Lugaluru  Guatt  figure us a jump for it We caught him  we caught him!
in  continuous acceleration  as much as we can stand  Well worryabout decelerating when were in shooting distance miles--hundreds  not thousands--35° North Latitude  15° west ofthe sunset line  Ship is under fire  bomb explosions near her theres another ship detected but not visible  somewhere around theequator  and a third one somewhere out of sight  we can just get thefringe of her contragravity field around the planet Shes in trouble 
and water vapor like crazy Well  is she a good guy or a bad guy
Another ship making signal 
the equator  Sword-World impulse code; her communication-screencombination  and an identify-yourself Well  Sir Nevil! A pleasant surprise 
We last met on the terrace at Karvall House  did we not
Trask! Satan curse you   !
Well  go for her! Give her everything!
you a friend Sword-World ship Nemesis; Im Prince Lucas Trask of Tanith commanding Royal Mardukan ship Victrix 
Bentrik  commanding Are you still battle-worthy
Seventy per cent of the ships sealed off  and weve been holed in adozen places  We have power enough for lift and some steering-way We cant make lateral way except at the expense of lift into a tight circle above her can to cover you All you can is all you can; thank you  Prince Trask 
Here comes the Enterprise!
She hairpinned on us 
Well  do something about her!
Well shot  Victrix! Well shot!
unprintability!That was our planetbuster 
use on Dunnan I didnt know we had one 
weaponeers I wonder 
Dunnan was on that ship 
XIX

I doubt we can get her off-planet again  let alone into hyperspace 
then here havent been exactly popular on Marduk  lately  They may thank youfor bringing me back to stand trial Id have anybody shot who let his ship get caught as I did mine Those two were down in atmosphere before I knew theyd come out ofhyperspace I think they were down on the planet before your ship arrived 
Oh  thats ridiculous  Prince Trask!
cant hide a ship on a planet  Not from the kind of instruments wehave in the Royal Navy We have pretty fair detection ourselves 
with a thousand or so feet of water over her  Thats where I wasgoing to hide the Nemesis  if I got here ahead of Dunnan But the locals  They didnt know about it 
in directly over the ocean  out of the sun  and nobodyd see the ship Is that a regular Space Viking trick
wanted to ambush your ship  hed have thought of it  too  Its theonly practical way to do it You may find youre quite welcome on Marduk  at that 
years  I believe  as you do  that this enemy of yours is responsiblefor all of them  We have half the Royal Navy out now  patrolling ourtrade-planets  Even if he wasnt aboard the Enterprise when youblew her up  youve put a name on him and can tell us a good dealabout him ridiculous  one might even think he was making war on Marduk Sword-Worlds scraping to the class above him; hes too busy trying to shovehimself up into it  And the men who ship out as Space Vikings arethe least class-conscious of the lot  Think my men may have troubleon Marduk about that Theyll all insist on doing their drinking inthe swankiest places in town arent twelve feet tall  with three horns like a Zarathustra damnthingand a spiked tail like a Fafnir mantichore that they wont even noticeanything less  Might do some good  in the long run  Crown Prince Edvardwill like your Space Vikings  Hes much opposed to class distinctionsand caste prejudices  Says they have to be eliminated before we canmake democracy really work Why  it sounds like feudalism to me!
support of his great nobles; they owe theirs to their barons andlandholding knights; they owe theirs to their people  There arelimits beyond which none of them can go; after that  their vassalsturn on them troops to support the baronroyal city and hold the crown lands  the king has no troops  If hewants troops  he has to get them from his great nobles; they have toget them from their vassal barons  who raise them by calling outtheir people oppress his people; it might be their turn next You mean  the people are armed
Great Satan  arent yours
sufferance  If their ballots arent secured by arms  theyreworthless  Who has the arms on your planetWhy  the Government 
You mean the King
The people cant; you just told me that they arent armed  andthe Government is And in the end 
property owner and the only employer on the planet  and everybodyelse would be slaves  working at assigned tasks  wearingGovernment-issued clothing and eating Government food  theirchildren educated as the Government prescribes and trained for jobsselected for them by the Government  never reading a book or seeinga play or thinking a thought that the Government had notapproved    legislate themselves into slavery They have something about like that on Aton 
Nationalist gang got into control fifty years ago  during the crisisafter the war with Baldur    They were voted into power by the people  werent they
Yes; they were 
measure  and they were given emergency powers  Once they were in they made the emergency permanent That couldnt happen on Marduk!
the next election Oh  then Marduks safe! The sunll go nova first

Your Majesty! I am most deeply honored!
Are you all right  Simon
They havent done anything to you  have they
a comrade  Your Majesty  Have I your permission to present informally  their commander  Prince Trask of TanithIndeed you may  Simon  I owe the gentleman my deepest thanks 
His Majesty  Mikhyl the Eighth  Planetary King of Marduk 
of Tanith for his Majesty Angus the First of Gram of my kinsman Prince Bentrik  and then at the honor of meeting onein the confidence of my fellow sovereign King Angus of Gram  I willnever be ungrateful for what you did for my cousin and for hisofficers and men  You must stay at the Palace while you are on thisplanet; I am giving orders for your reception  and I wish you to beformally presented to me this evening that is one of the Sword-Worlds  is it notAre you really a Space Viking  Prince Trask
Nobodys going to be sticky about what happened on Audhumla 
mix you up in that  Its not only about the action on Audhumla;everybody from the Space Minister down wants to hear what you knowabout this fellow Dunnan  Like yourself  we all hope he went toEm-See-Square along with his flagship  but we cant take it forgranted  We have over a dozen trade-planets to protect  and heshit more than half of them already Look at that city!
civilized planets  but I never realized they were anything likethis  Why  this makes Excalibur look like Tanith!more of them  If there were two billion people on Gram--which I hopethere never will be--Gram would have cities like this  too I dont care how many people they have 
had  A wolf never cares how many sheep there are in a flock  Withtwenty ships  we could take this planet like we took Eglonsby Thered be losses coming in  sure  but after we were in and down wed have it Where would we get twenty ships
that nonsenseOh  let them rave 
waits  the more theyll be ridiculed when the facts are published daughter Thats too close to take chances with him 
Simon  Youll have to be a spaceport spaceman from now on I shant be sorry 
Prince Trask gratitude  I do Trask  my son wants to meet you  very badly  Hes ten years old  andhe thinks Space Vikings are romantic heroes He should be one  for a while 
cousin valued friend to me and my house 
ballroom You are quite the cynosure  you know 
and I can sit down  Your Majesty was the center of attention in thethrone room  yet I seemed to detect a look of relief as you left it I try to hide it  as much as possible 
Majesty can be rather wearying  you know 
the evening  relaxing over our wine and tobacco Goodman LucasRight  Goodman Mikhyl 
I hear a few hard things about your trade  Goodman Lucas 
robbers  as one of my fellow tradesmen says  The worst of it is thatrobbery and murder become just that: a trade  like servicing robotsor selling groceries crippled Victrix  Whysure whether you killed him or notcan really trust  One or the other would stay wherever he has hisbase all the time And when you do kill him; what then
later  Ill have one quarrel too many with King Angus  and then wewill be our Majesty Lucas the First of Tanith  and we will sit on athrone and receive our subjects  And Ill be glad when I can get mycrown off and talk to a few men who call me shipmate  instead ofYour Majesty subject to renounce his sovereign  of course  but that might be anexcellent thing  You met the ambassador from Ithavoll at dinner  didyou not Three centuries ago  Ithavoll was a colony of Marduk--itseems we cant afford colonies  any more--and it seceded from us Ithavoll was then a planet like your Tanith seems to be  Today  itis a civilized world  and one of Marduks best friends  You know sometimes I think a few lights are coming on again  here and therein the Old Federation  If so  you Space Vikings are helping to lightthem localsBut they have to be used for civilized ends  Do you know anythingabout a Space Viking raid on Aton  over a century agodamaged and without booty nations; the two greatest were at the brink of war  and the otherswere waiting to pounce on the exhausted victor and then fight eachother for the spoils  The Space Vikings forced them to unite  Out ofthat temporary alliance came the League for Common Defense  and fromthat the Planetary Republic  The Republics a dictatorship  now  andjust between Goodman Mikhyl and Goodman Lucas its a nasty one andour Majestys Government doesnt like it at all  It will be smashedsooner or later  but theyll never go back to divided sovereigntyand nationalism again  The Space Vikings frightened them out of thatwhen the dangers inherent in it couldnt  Maybe this man Dunnan willdo the same for us on Marduk You have troubles
Youve seen decivilized planets  How does it happen
and industries  Survivors among ruins  too busy keeping their ownbodies alive to try to keep civilization alive  Then they lose allknowledge of how to be civilized erosion  and while its going on  nobody notices it  Everybody isproud of their civilization  their wealth and culture  But trade isfalling off; fewer ships come in each year  So there is boastfultalk about planetary self-sufficiency; who needs off-planet tradeanyhow Everybody seems to have money  but the government is alwaysbroke  Deficit spending--and always the vital social services forwhich the government has to spend money  The most vital one  ofcourse  is buying votes to keep the government in power  And it getsharder for the government to get anything done Trask closed his eyes  Again  he could feel the mellow sun of Gramon his back  and hear the laughing voices on the lower terrace  andhe was talking to Lothar Ffayle and Rovard Grauffis and Alex Gorramand Cousin Nikkolay and Otto Harkaman  He said:Mikhyl VIII looked across the low table at his guest   the King said

Permission to come aboard  sir
youre just in time for second breakfast Is that a Sword-World robot  sir  or did you capture it somewhere
Its one of our own 
it does some cooking on top  at the back that be a servant as nobles servants of jobs You need all your people for fighting men  dont you
five hundred men; most of them around eight hundred Of course  Most of them are ground-fighters 
I wish I were a Space Viking!
Navy  Youre supposed to fight Space Vikings I wont fight you 
Youd have to  if the King commanded 
No  Prince Trask is my friend  He saved my fathers life 
fireworks  and then well each go home and claim victory  How wouldthat beIve heard of things like that 
with Odin  seventy years ago  that was mostly that sort of battles Besides  the King is Prince Trasks friend  too 
lie when theyre on the Throne  do theyGood Kings dont 
Ours is a good King 
My house owes Prince Trask a debt talk  Count Steven Prince Bentrik was surprised  That couldnt have been avoided  atthe time shouldnt be allowed to happen many more times  though the time itll take to get all the ships equipped as they come in detection system  Prince Trask though were informing Space Vikings about our technical secrets    Well have to find out where the fellow has his base 
assume that he was on his flagship when you blew it  and just putpaid to him and forget himwent anywhere on the same ship  after he came out here andestablished a base  I think one of them would stay home all thetime Well  well give you everything we have on them 
too  I just skimmed over the summary of what you gave us; I daresaywell both get a lot of new information  Have you any idea at allwhere he might be based  Prince TraskOnly that we think its a non-Terra-type planet 
great deal Federation space-volume that are inhabitable in artificialenvironment  Including a few completely covered by seas  where youcould put in underwater dome cities if you had the time andmaterial What I should like to know 
of a Dunnan knew wed have a ship on Audhumla just when we did I dont think he just pulled that planet out of a hat and then wentthere prepared to sit on the bottom of the ocean for a year and ahalf waiting for something to turn up  I think he knew theVictrix was coming to Audhumla  and just about when I dont like that  commodore 
You think I do  sir
is  though  We all have to face it We do 
caution you to screen everybody you put onto it very carefully the Navys had anything like this to worry about I mustPrince Edvards  I mean Baron Cragdales  hunting lodge Well be going there directly from here 
Ah 
Well  well keep in contact  Prince Trask 
time  Prince Trask  She is precisely eight years old; I saw hergetting ready for bed before I came down here  Ill look in on herafter dinner that sort of thingWell  we dont use the word government very much 
talk a lot about authority and sovereignty  and Im afraid we burnentirely too much powder over it  but government always seems to uslike sovereignty interfering in matters that dont concern it  Aslong as sovereignty maintains a reasonable semblance of good publicorder and makes the more serious forms of crime fairly hazardous forthe criminals  were satisfied positive for the peopleword--doesnt do anything for the people!individual lord or baron And the people have no voice at all; why  thats tyranny 
people do that for themselves  The government  if you want to thinkof it as that  just sees to it that nobodys shooting at them whiletheyre doing it pensions whooping for uninhabited planet rescued  all three were immensely wealthy  from trading hats witheach other  Thats about the way this thing will work to civilized society on Marduk Im inclined to agree with Prince Trask 
Makann now May I put it on  to show you what I mean
The Ministries are full of them! They are all traitors! Thebloodthirsty reactionaries of the falsely so-called Crown LoyalistParty! The grasping conspiracy of the interstellar bankers! Thedirty Gilgameshers! They are all leagued together in an unholyconspiracy! And now this Space Viking  this bloody-handed monsterfrom the Sword-Worlds    Shut the horrible man off 
Makann! Makann! Makann the Leader! Makann to Power!
You even let him have a private army
Oh  those silly buffoons and their musical-comedy uniforms 
They arent armed 
Not visibly 
Not yet 
I dont know where theyd get arms 
No  Your Highness 
Thats what Im worried about

Id rather enjoy them in company  If your Ministerial duties do notforbid  could you be the companyaffairs of state  Square root  Have you seen the grottoes Theyredown this way informal discussions about co-operation against this mutual enemyof ours  Dunnan  This is fine; it has my approval  and the approvalof Prince Vandarvant  the Prime Minister  and  I might add  that ofGoodman Mikhyl  I think it ought to go further  though  A formal treatybetween Tanith and Marduk would be greatly to the advantage of both proposing marriage on rather short acquaintance Its only beenfifty hours since the Nemesis orbited in here a large Gilgamesher colony here  You have a few on Tanith  haventyou Well  anything one Gilgamesher knows  they all find out  andours are co-operative with Naval intelligence advantageous  Id be quite in favor of it  Co-operation againstDunnan  of course  and reciprocal trade-rights on each otherstrade-planets  and direct trade between Marduk and Tanith  AndBeowulf and Amaterasu would come into it  too  Does this also havethe approval of the Prime Minister and the Kingand the King  as youll have noticed  The King cant be in favor ofanything till the Assembly or the Chancellor express an opinion Prince Vandarvant favors it personally; as Prime Minister  he isreserving his opinion  Well have to get the support of the CrownLoyalist Party before he can take an unequivocal position we just work out a rough outline of what this treaty ought to be and then consult  unofficially  with a few people whom you cantrust  and see what can be done about presenting it to the propergovernment officials    Controversial 
every general election  On this planet  you can always kick theGilgameshers and the Armed Forces with impunity  neither have votesand neither can kick back  The whole thingll be forgotten the dayafter the election  It always is Thats if Makann doesnt win the election 
get along without the Navy  and they bloody well know it Audhumla  no at least a thousand people  from myself down to the shoeshine boys could have known about it as soon as the order was taped Skathi as junk a century ago and tinkered up by the locals  She wasin here twice  according to the commercial shipping records  and thesecond time she was in too bad shape to be moved out  and Sasstroffcouldnt pay to have her rebuilt  so she was libeled for spaceportcharges and sold  Some one-lung trading company bought her and fixedher up a little; they went bankrupt in a year or so  and she wasbought by another small company  Startraders  Ltd   and theyve beenusing her on a milk-run to and from Gimli  They seem to be alegitimate outfit  but were looking into them  Were looking forSasstroff  too  but we havent been able to find him there knows anything about her  You may discover that she hasntbeen going there at all We might  at that 
Well just find out 
Do you think it would be wise
lunatics would pick it up and twist it into evidence of some kindof a sinister plot Oh  I believe Her Majesty could sign a treaty with Prince Trask 
very secret Gee!
wicked rulers of the old dictatorship!Ill bet Grandpa doesnt even have any secret treaties!
SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME! SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME!
SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME! SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME!
Fire!
fire now!Those police were murdered 
man who ordered them out there unarmed That would be Count Naydnayr  the Minister of Security 
Then hes the one you want to hang for it 
What else would you have done
machine-gun fire as soon as the mob crossed it  and kept on firingtill the survivors turned tail and ran  Then sent out more cars  andshot everybody wearing a Peoples Watchmen uniform  all over town Inside forty-eight hours  thered be no Peoples Welfare party  andno Zaspar Makann either things in the Sword-Worlds  Prince Trask  Its not the way we dothings here on Marduk  Our government does not propose to be guiltyof shedding the blood of its people Marduk  You could have made almost anything of it  But its too latenow  Youve torn down the gates; the barbarians are in 
XXIII

Traskon  any more  Traskon is now the personal property of our wellloved--very well loved--Queen Evita  The Trasks dont own enoughland on Gram now for a family cemetery  You see what you didhelped put Angus on the throne  and it would have been about thesame in the end It could be a lot different 
your ships and men back to Gram and put yourself on the throne renounce my allegiance to Angus  I can trade on Morglay or Joyeuseor Flamberge just as easily Count Lionel and Duke Joris are both defying Angus; theyve refusedto furnish him men  theyve driven out his tax collectors  thosethey havent hanged  and theyre building ships of their own  Angusis building ships  too  I dont know whether hes going to use themto fight Bigglersport and Newhaven  or attack you  but theres goingto be a war before another years out All right 
bring that ship back under Angus of Wardshavens charter and wellfire on her Just call yourself Prince of Tanith 
make any difference in your authority here  and if you do lay claimto the throne of Gram  nobody can say youre a foreign king tryingto annex the planet King of Gram Why  yes 
Secondhand booty  I raided Dagon for it 
Barragons ships were raiding one of our planets 
of the locals  I found out about it from Captain Ravallo of theBlack Star  on Indra; hed just been from Ganpat  Beowulf wasnttoo far out of the way  so we put in there  and found theGrendelsbane just ready to space out joined us  and the three of us went to Dagon  We blew up one ofBarragons ships  and put the other one down out of commission  andthen we sacked his base  There was a Gilgamesher colony there; wedidnt bother them  Theyll tell what we did  and why That should furnish Prince Viktor of Xochitl something to ponder 
Where are the other ships  now
to do a little trading on the way  The Black Star went to Xochitl Just a friendly visit  to say hello to Prince Viktor for you Ravallo has a lot of audiovisuals we made during the DagonOperation  Then shes going to Jagannath to visit Nikky Gratham our own industries  we can produce what we need  and we can tradewith Beowulf and Amaterasu  and with Xochitl and Jagannath and Hoth if we can make any sort of agreement with them; everybody agrees tolet everybody elses trade-planets alone  Its too bad you couldntget some kind of an agreement with Marduk will probably be raiding Marduk You think itll be like that
are rising; they have a leader  and theyre uniting  Every societyrests on a barbarian base  The people who dont understandcivilization  and wouldnt like it if they did  The hitchhikers The people who create nothing  and who dont appreciate what othershave created for them  and who think civilization is something thatjust exists and that all they need to do is enjoy what they canunderstand of it--luxuries  a high living standard  and easy workfor high pay  Responsibilities Phooey! What do they havea government forthe car than the people who designed it  so theyre going to grabthe controls  Zaspar Makann says they can  and hes the Leader understand it  though  I was reading about Hitler  on the way home I wouldnt be surprised if Zaspar Makann had been reading aboutHitler  too  Hes using all Hitlers tricks  But Hitler came topower in a country which had been impoverished by a military defeat Marduk hasnt fought a war in almost two generations  and that onewas a farce the ruling class of his nation  the people who kept things running were discredited  The masses  the homemade barbarians  didnt haveanybody to take their responsibilities for them  What they have onMarduk is a ruling class that has been discrediting itself  A rulingclass thats ashamed of its privileges and shirks its duties  Aruling class that has begun to believe that the masses are just asgood as they are  which they manifestly are not  And a ruling classthat wont use force to maintain its position  And they have ademocracy  and they are letting the enemies of democracy shelterthemselves behind democratic safeguards the word for it their power  and our people arent hitchhikers  and as long as theyget decent treatment they dont try to run things  And were notdoing so well one of them--Napolyon of Flamberge  Rodolf of Excalibur  or Angus ofabout half of Gram--who is devoted to civilization or anything elseoutside himself  and thats the mark of the barbarian What are you devoted to  Otto
You  You are my chieftain  Thats another mark of the barbarian 
So thats it 
election and theyre afraid to antagonize anybody who might have avote  So the Navy had to drop the investigation  Everybody onMarduks scared of this Makann  You think there might be some tie-upbetween him and Dunnantrade-planets since the Battle of Audhumlacouple of Mardukan ships there  and they had the Victrix fixed upenough to do some fighting  They ran the Bolide out Mardukan Navy ship came in  They were glad to see me; it savedthem sending off a pinnace for Tanith  They had news for you  anda couple of passengers Passengers
anybody with side-whiskers and buttoned-up coats see them What those people know gets all over the place before long 
and impose myself and Steven on you  Prince Trask he insisted  We spent the whole voyage to Gimli concealed in thecaptains quarters; only a few of the officers knew we were aboard Makann won the election  Is that it
doesnt want to risk you and Steven being used as hostagesThats it 
might as well have  Nobody has a majority of seats in the Chamber ofRepresentatives but hes formed a coalition with several of thesplinter parties  and Im ashamed to say that a number of CrownLoyalist members--Crowd of Disloyalists  I call them--are votingwith him  now  Theyve coined some ridiculous phrase about the waveof the future  whatever that means If you cant lick them  join them 
If you cant lick them  lick their boots 
My son is a trifle bitter 
to a trace of bitterness  too Well  thats the Representatives 
of the governmentmajority of seats in the Delegates  Most of them would haveindignantly denied  a month before  having any connection withMakann  but a hundred out of a hundred and twenty are hissupporters  Makann  of course  is Chancellor And who is Prime Minister
Andray Dunnan
The Prime Minister is Crown Prince Edvard  No; Baron Cragdale That isnt a royal title  so by some kind of a fiction I cantpretend to understand he is not Prime Minister as a member ofthe Royal Family If you cant    
believes  very sincerely  that the election was an expression ofthe will of the people  and that it is his duty to bow to it just small arms; combat vehicles and heavy weapons  As soon as thenew government was formed  they were given status as a part of thePlanetary Armed Forces  They have taken over every police stationon the planet And the King
else can he do Weve been whittling down and filching away thepowers of the Throne for the last three centuries that you two would be used as hostagesHes going to fight 
Maybe as a guerrilla in the mountains  I dont know  But if he cantlick them  he wont join them  I wanted to stay with him and helphim; he told me I could help him best by placing myself and Stevenwhere he wouldnt worry about us I wanted to stay 
But he said that I must take care of Mother  And if he were killed I must be able to avenge him You talk like a Sword-Worlder; I told you that once before 
Princess Myrnaand Lady Valerie
Theyre at Cragdale; theyll be safe there  I hope 

XXIV

Prince Viktors fire see a lot of good firemen around  If there is a battle you will seethat Stevens in a safe place  wont youIn a space attack  there are no safe places  Ill keep him with me 
Well  you wont be on any ship  Count  Youll be on my staff 
Marduk doesnt like us  any more 
ships on all their trade-planets  and they all have orders to fireon any  repeat any  Space Vikings  including the ships of theself-styled Prince of Tanith  I got this from Captain Garravay ofthe Vindex  After we were through talking  we fought a nice littleship-to-ship action for him to make films of  I dont think anybodycould see anything wrong with it This order came from Makann
retired on account of quote ill-health unquote  He is now in a quotehospital unquote Wheres Prince Bentrik
and he just vanished  Gone underground  or secretly arrested andexecuted; take your choice of them  That isnt to catch Dunnan  Thats to disperse the Navyaway from Marduk  They dont trust the Navy  Is Prince Edvardstill Prime Ministerin a scrupulously legal manner  outside of making his PeoplesWatchmen part of the armed forces  Protesting his devotion tothe King every time he opens his mouth When will the fire be  I wonder
Probably happened by now The whole things just a big Gilgamesher lie 
himself--paid them to tell us that  to pin our ships down here Or they made it up themselves  so they could make hay on ourtrade-planets Lets go down to the Ghetto and clean out the whole gang 
Anything one of thems in  theyre all in together 
Nifflheim with that; lets all space out for Xochitl 
we have enough to lick them on their own planet Prince Trask; I must speak to you as soon as possible 
It is of the first importance 
its of the first importance  the sooner you tell me about it    you can command  Satan only knows whats happening there now  butthree thousand hours ago  when the Duke sent me off  Omfray of Glaspythwas landing on Wardshaven  He has a fleet of eight ships  furnishedto him by his wifes kinsman  the King of Haulteclere  They are commandedby King Konrads Space Viking cousin  the Prince of Xochitl Angus--the former King Angus  or maybe even the late King Angus I suppose he is now--but a murderer like Omfray of Glaspyth    You dont want to do either  do you
what would happen if we did thatplanet-holders like Gratham and the Everrards would combine againstus and make a slag-pile out of Tanith Viktors kept his ships away from our planets  If we attackedXochitl now  without provocation  nobodyd know what to expect fromus  People like Nikky Gratham and Tobbin of Nergal and the Everrardsof Hoth get nervous around unpredictable dangers  and when they getnervous they get trigger-happy Then youll be going back to Gram 
crowd are wrong doesnt make Valpry and Rathmore and Ffayle right You heard what I was telling those very people at Karvall House  theday I met you  And youve seen whats been happening on Gram sincewe came out here  Otto  the Sword-Worlds are finished; theyre halfdecivilized now  Civilization is alive and growing here on Tanith I want to stay here and help it grow Look  Lucas 
the Admiral  But Im telling you; youll have to do something  orthis whole setup of yours will fall apart  As it stands  you canattack Xochitl and the Back-To-Gram party would go along  or youcan decide on this crusade against Omfray of Glaspyth and theRaid-Xochitl-Now party would go along  But if you let this go onmuch longer  you wont have any influence over either party finished wont raid Xochitl; I told you why  and you agreed  And I wontspend the men and ships and wealth of Tanith in any Sword-Worlddynastic squabble  Great Satan  Otto; you were in the Durendal War This is the same thing  and itll go on for another half a century Then what will you do
I came out here after Andray Dunnan  didnt I
wont be as interested in Dunnan as you are Hitler  coming in from Marduk I will tell them all a big lie Such a big lie that nobody will dare to disbelieve it 
XXV

Do you think I was afraid of Viktor of Xochitl
a dozen ships; we could make a new Van Allen belt around Tanith ofthem  with what we have here  Our real enemy is on Marduk  notXochitl; his names Zaspar Makann  Zaspar Makann  and Andray Dunnan the man I came out from Gram to hunt; theyre in alliance  andI believe Dunnan is on Marduk  himself  now Well  here; we dont know anything about this Zaspar Makann 
No  you dont 
and listen  till you find out a little about him we were hunting for him I wouldnt be surprised 
Dunnan was Zaspar Makann  I know he doesnt look like Dunnan  weall saw him on screen  but theres such a thing as plastic surgery five years ago  That would be about the time Dunnan would havearrived on Marduk and all the time and money weve invested in it  to go back to Gramand pull your chestnuts out of the fire Gehenna with you! Werestaying here and defending our own planet  If youre smart  youllstay here with us but safe and well How are you
way For all I know  shes Queen of Marduk  now our planet give you and took overAnd  of course  they elected Makann Chancellor; that did it 
Representatives have been arrested  on all kinds of ridiculouscharges--sex-crimes  receiving bribes  being in the pay of foreignpowers  nothing too absurd  Then they rammed through a lawempowering the Chancellor to fill vacancies in the Chamber ofRepresentatives by appointment Why did the Crown Prince lend himself to a thing like that
is an almost holy symbol to the people  Even Makann was forcedto pretend loyalty to the King and the Crown Prince    It didnt work; he played right into Makanns hands  What happened
You werent just sitting on your hands  were you
Oh  no 
thought myself capable of  a few years ago  Organizing a mutineeringconspiracy in the Royal Mardukan Navy  After Admiral Shefter wasforcibly retired and shut up in an insane asylum  I disappearedand turned into a civilian contragravity-lifter operator at theMalverton Navy Yard  Finally  when I was suspected  one of theofficers--he was arrested and tortured to death later--managedto smuggle me onto a lighter for the Moonbase  I was an orderlyin the hospital there  The day the Crown Prince was murdered  wehad a mutiny of our own  We killed everybody we even suspected ofbeing a Makannist  The Moonbase has been under attack from theplanet ever since Well talk about this later  There are some people here    
Dunnan is working with Zaspar Makann  and as soon as Makannconsolidates his position hes sending an expedition againstTanith How in blazes did you find that out  here
From the Gilgameshers
Prince Trask 
Valerie!
you here Welcome to Tanith  Your Highness!glad to see you  Theres been such awful things happened!among friends; friends with whom you have a treaty  Rememberplay-Queen  And now I know what they meant when they talked aboutwhen Grandpa and Pappa would be through being King  Pappa didnteven get to be King!Lady Valerie  will you come with us
quarters for Princess Myrna Is it Princess Myrna  or is it Queen Myrna
when we left Moonbase  but that was five hundred hours ago  We dontknow anything about her mother  either  She was at the Palace whenPrince Edvard was murdered; weve heard absolutely nothing abouther  The King made a few screen appearances  parroting things Makannwanted him to say  Under hypnosis  That was probably the very leastof what they did to him  Theyve turned him into a zombi Well  how did Myrna get to Moonbase
Kobbly  and Captain Rainer  They armed the servants at Cragdale withhunting rifles and everything else they could scrape up  capturedPrince Edvards space-yacht  and took off in her  Took a couple ofhits from ground batteries getting off  and from ships aroundMoonbase getting in  Ships of the Royal Mardukan Navy!They sent the yacht off to Gimli 
theyll try to rally as many of the Royal Navy units as havent goneover to Makann  Theyre to assemble on Gimli and await my return If I dont return in fifteen hundred hours from the time I leftMoonbase  theyre to use their own judgment  Id expect thattheyd move in on Marduk and attack Thats sixty-odd days 
time to expect that lunar base to hold out  against a whole planet Marduk was fighting a combination of six other planets  It held outagainst continuous attack  once  for almost a year  Its beenconstantly strengthened ever since And what have they to throw at it
over to Makann  Four fifteen-hundred-footers  same class as theVictrix  and two thousand-footers  Then  there were four ofAndray Dunnans ships--You mean  he really is on Marduk
Yes: Fortuna  Bolide  and two armed merchantmen  a Baldurbuiltship called the Reliable  and your friend Honest Horris You didnt really believe Dunnan was on Marduk
those people out of that crusade against Omfray of Glaspyth Im not surprised  We decided  long ago  that Dunnan was planningto raid Marduk  It appears that we underestimated him  Maybe hewas reading about Hitler  too  He wasnt planning any raid; hewas planning conquest  in the only way a great civilization canbe conquered--by subversion Yes 
programme  who was this Makann  anyhowNobody 
a coven of fellow-crackpots  who met in the back room of a saloonand had their office in a cigar box  The next year  he had a suiteof offices and was buying time on a couple of telecasts  The yearafter that  he had three telecast stations of his own  andwas holding rallies and meetings of thousands of people  Andso on  upward Makann moved in behind the King  And Dunnan will have him shotthe way he had Prince Edvard shot  and use the murder as a pretextto liquidate his personal followers out of hyperspace on Tanith and smash him now  while hes still little enough to smash The Nemesis  the Corisande  and the Space Scourge for sure
possible  We dont know how many ships will be gathered there but we dont want them wasted in detail-attacks  Tell whoeversin command there that ships from Tanith are on the way  and towait for them Even after we get through arguing about it  Argument is not exclusively a feature of democracies 
It isnt a Space Viking fleet 
are only three Space Vikings in it  The rest are the ships of threecivilized planets  Tanith  Beowulf and Amaterasu Marduk  or Baldur or Odin  or   Well  arent you
We are Space Vikings!
with the Neobarbarians of Zaspar Makann Well  I wont argue the last half of it  Steven 
Are you people done yakking about whos civilized and who isnt
ready to jump Jumping 
We think weve figured out where Dunnans base is 
Oh  good!
Wheres yours
Abaddon 
the Marduk system checking our outside planets to see if Prince Viktor might be hidingon one of them Well  what with the time element  and the way theHonest Horris was shuttling back and forth from Marduk to someplace that wasnt Gimli  and the way Dunnan was able to bring hisships in as soon as the shooting started on Marduk  we thought hemust be on an uninhabited outer planet of the Marduk system I dont know why we never thought of that  ourselves 
Its only a small planet  about four thousand miles in diameter  andits three and a half billion miles from primary  Its frozen solid It would take almost a year to get to it on Abbot drive  and if yourship has Dillinghams  why not take a little longer and go to a goodplanet So nobody bothered with Abaddon No 
strategy is decided Well  how about the Mardukan Navy
Fleet Admiral Barghams in command at Gimli He may be  at present  but he wont be when I get there  I will be 
commodore know dead  The Crown Prince is dead  The Princess Myrna is a child I am assuming the position of Regent and Prince-Protector of the Realm 
XXVI

Thats Zaspar Makann and his stooges youre talking about
Well  the Constitution    
chosen by election  Even members of the Royal Family cant justmake themselves Regent by saying they are more elections  at least for the present  Not till we make sure thepeople of Marduk can be trusted with the control of the government navy battleships and four other craft attacking them other trade-planets  but I havent heard from any of them  We cantgo there with only four ships Sixteen ships 
were using for a troopship  I think thats enough  Youll remainhere on Gimli  in any case  admiral; as soon as the other ships comein  youll follow to Marduk with them  I am now holding a meetingaboard the Tanith flagship Nemesis  I want your four ship-commandersaboard immediately  I am not including you because youre remaininghere to bring up the late comers and as soon as this meeting is overwe are spacing out Go on in 
within a mile if necessary  They could be hiding somewhere on it sure Simon Bentrik  Prince-Protector of Marduk  calling Moonbase 
Moonbase; this is Simon Bentrik  Prince-Protector  speaking Prince-Protector thingSomebody had to do it  Is the King still alive
know what it was like--urging everybody to obey and co-operatewith our trusted Chancellor  Makann always appeared on the screenwith him I remember 
speech  After a while  the King wasnt able to speak coherently;hed stammer  and repeat  So then Makann did all the talking; theycouldnt even depend on him to parrot what they were giving him withan earplug phone  Then he stopped appearing entirely  I supposethere were physical symptoms they couldnt allow to be seen I hope for his sake that he is dead 
So do I 
you left Fortuna  We blew out the Malverton Navy Yard  Theyre still usingthe Antarctic Naval Base  but weve knocked out a good deal of that We got the Honest Horris  They made two attempts to land on us andlost a couple of ships  Eight hundred hours ago  they were joined bythe rest of Dunnans fleet  five ships  They made a landing onMalverton while it was turned away from us  Makann announced thatthey were RMN units from the trade-planets that had joined him  Isuppose the planet-side public swallowed that  He also announced thattheir commander  Admiral Dunnan  was in command of the PeoplesArmed Forces stick theyMardukan Navy ships Champion and Guardian  There are fiveorbiting off the planet: Ex-RMNS Paladin  and Dunnan shipsStarhopper  Banshee  Reliable and Exporter  The lasttwo are listed as merchantmen  but theyre performing likeregulation battlecraft All right  we have to take all our bad eggs in one basket 
Try to hit them as soon after they join as possible 
traitors first!Scratch one traitor!
There went one of ours 
Wheres the Black Star
Gone to Em-See-Square 
Dunnan-Makanns  Bolide and Reliable Here comes the Starhopper again!
Tell him to wait a moment; we have troubles 
We just lost one of our Mardukans 
that got her looks like the Banshee; Im turning to engage her Which way; west around the planet Be right with you  captain 

XXVII

of those ships would have been destroyed  without anybody seeingit happen the battle together and headed in for the planet  They didnt comehere to help liberate Marduk  they came here to fill their cargoholds  I only hope the people theyre robbing all voted the Makannticket in the last election will be Makanns storm-troops and Dunnans pirates; theyll be theones to get killed We dont want any more killing than    
Edvard blood was shed  If theyre doing what you think they are  Im afraidwell have to kill a few of your Space Vikings  too They arent my Space Vikings 
fighting them till the main wars over  Those three shiploads areno worse than a bad cold; Makann and Dunnan are the plague he is your King; if he is not  I am your Queen  and until I am oldenough to rule in my own right  I accept Prince Simon as Regentand Protector of the Realm  and I call on all of you to obey himas I will democracy  or the constitution the use of the word rule  instead of reign Thats right 
something wrong with democracy  If there werent  it couldnt beoverthrown by people like Makann  attacking it from within bydemocratic procedures  I dont think its fundamentally unworkable I think it just has a few of what engineers call bugs  Its notsafe to run a defective machine till you learn the defects andremedy them bugs It may just be 
unworkable about government itself  As long as Homo sapiens terrais a wild animal  which he has always been and always will be untilhe evolves into something different in a million or so years  maybea workable system of government is a political science impossibility just as transmutation of elements was a physical-science impossibilityas long as they tried to do it by chemical means it breaks down  hope the next try will work a little better  for alittle longer Youre not going 
about taking care of myself    Youre to stay aboard  Count 
stabilize  Princess Myrna will have to come down  Youll act asher personal escort  And dont think youre being shoved into thebackground  Shes Crown Princess  and if she isnt Queen now  shewill be in a few years  Escorting her now will be the foundation ofyour naval career  There isnt a young officer in the Royal Navy whowouldnt trade places with you That was the right way to handle him  Lucas 
Itll do just what I said for him 
be Queen in a few years  if she isnt now  Queens need PrinceConsorts  Your sons a good boy; I liked him the first moment I sawhim  and Ive liked him better ever since  Hed be a good man onthe throne beside Queen Myrna theyre about a sixteenth cousin  But people would say I was abusingthe Protectorship to marry my son onto the Throne to learn  Youve learned one important lesson already  that a rulermust be willing to use force and shed blood to enforce his rule  Youhave to learn  too  that a ruler cannot afford to be guided by hisfears of what people will say about him  Not even what history willsay about him  A rulers only judge is himself have to talk it over with     with my only judge  Well  lets go expedition!man hiding behind thatYou know what this is  dont you
a veridicator  That globell light blue; the moment you try to lieto us  itll turn red  And the moment it turns red  Im going tohammer your teeth down your throat with the butt of this pistol Have you found anything out about the King  yet
than a month ago about him  He just disappeared Hes dead 
him and used him as a ventriloquists dummy on the screen as long asthey could; when they couldnt let the people see him any more they stuffed him into a converter Well have to have something done about that 
didnt think hed do just this  I thought he wanted to abolish theThrone  not sit on it me any Space Viking captain can control his crew  These men didnt comehere to correct the political mistakes of Marduk  They came here forwhat they could haul away  I could get myself killed trying to stopthem now    I wouldnt even try 
I came here for what I could make out of this planet  myself 
You can try to stop them 
Youll find it even harder than what youre doing now 
Could you talk your people into going to some other city
be fine looting  Drepplin The people there are Mardukan subjects  too 
By all means  gentlemen  Take your men to Drepplin  and nobody willobject to anything you do aground there  Captain Esthersan  You know what all Dunnan left there Says she knows where the King is     Im sorry  Your Highness; Dowager Crown Princess     have beentaking care of him  the best way we could  If youll only comequickly    Prince Bentrik! And its Prince Trask of Tanith!
care of  Please alive  I dont know how long  Thats our professional duty  But itsno kindness to His Majesty Is Prince Lucas Trask of Tanith here
anybody else now weve disarmed him and are holding him  If we turn him over toyou  will you let us goyou  the rest of you will be let outside this building and allowedto go away unharmed All right  Well be coming out in a minute 
Its agreed!
Bring him out 
couldnt rule without me  and neither can you gang of turncoats  and Ill rule Marduk for you Who are you
I dont know you 
I am Lucas Trask  Youve heard that name before 
away from behind him  you people Karvall  Well  you wont  Lord Trask of Traskon  She loves me  notyou  Shes waiting for me now  on Gram    Take that carrion and stuff it in a mass-energy converter 
to me again

Thirty minutes to Litchfield  sir 
Thats everything  Not many passengers left aboard  are there
the lower deck end of the run I know  I was born there 
of freight lately  I guess I dont have to tell you about Litchfield labor trouble nowLabor trouble
farm-tramps Ten of them for every job  if you call that trouble lower deck  and all your crewmen are armed  Not just pistols  either Oh  Thats on account of pirates 
Pirates
like farm-tramps; theyll have tommy guns and sawed-off shotguns intheir bindles  When the ships airborne and out of reach of help theyll break out their guns and take her  Usually kill all the crewand passengers  They dont like to leave live witnesses You heard about the Harriet Barne  didnt you
They didnt pirate her  did they
just a tag end of a radio call  that ended in a shot  Time the AirPatrol got to her estimated position it was too late  Nobodys everseen ship  officers  crew or passengers since Well  great Ghu; isnt the Government doing anything about it
there hasnt been a single case of piracy inside the city limits ofStorisende Poictesme
Hey! Zarathustra sunstone! Nice 
Where is he  Sis
Oh  emergency 
anything  In Tramptown  of course  But hell be at the party     Oops I shouldnt have said that; thats supposed to be a surprise Dont worry; Ill be surprised 
we all are to see him back     Now  Franz  put away the recorder; savethe interview for the Chronicle till later  Ah  Professor Kellton;one pupil Litchfield Academy can be proud of!Conn  what did you find out
isHello  boy 
Good to see you again 
It sure is  Conn 
Find out anything definite
We didnt have much time  Conn 
arranged a little celebration for you  Well start it with a dinner atSentas have to have a meal at Sentas before Id really feel at home in the meantime  Give the ladies a chance to fix up for the party  andhave a little drink and a talk together You want to do that  Conn
Yes  of course  Id like that 
Good melon crop this year
melons  This time next year well be washing our feet in brandy drink of Poictesme brandy on Terra This isnt Terra  and we arent selling it by the drink 
freighter captains pay us  Youve been away too long  Conn  Youveforgotten what its like to live in a poor-house This our stuff
Where did you dig it
over back of Snagtooth  in the Calders Everybody knows that wascleaned out years ago  Well  always take a second look at thesethings everybody knows  Ten to one theyre not so  It always botheredme that nobody found any underground attack-shelters  I took a secondlook  and sure enough  I found them  right underneath  mined out ofthe solid rock  Conn  youd be surprised at what I found there Where are you going to sell that stuff
private army for every man  woman and child in Poictesme some of the planets that were colonized right before the War andhavent gotten industrialized yet  Im clearing about two hundred solsa ton on it 
II

Well  gentlemen 
returned friend and new associate  Conn  were all anxious to hearwhat youve found out  but even if you didnt learn anything  werestill happy to have you back with us  Gentlemen; to our friend andneighbor  Welcome home  Conn!Well  its wonderful to be back  Mr  Fawzi 
And drink up  everybody  We have plenty of brandy  if we dont haveanything else You can say that again  Kurt 
and fermented    ferments Or why 
paying for wineOh  please 
and is going to tell us how we can solve all our problems Yes  Conn 
where Merlin is  didnt youI hope 
the map  where the computer is buried But its still here on Poictesme  isnt it
They didnt take it away with them
Most of you gentlemen 
on Terra  to study cybernetics and computer theory  It wouldnt do usany good to find Merlin if none of us could operate it  Well  Ivedone that  I can use any known type of computer  and train assistants After I graduated  I was offered a junior instructorship to computerphysics at the University You didnt mention that  son 
think it was very important I think it is 
of my boys from the Academy offered a place on the faculty of theUniversity of Montevideo  on Terra!Conn means 
Merlin used during the War by the Third Fleet-Army Force  code-named Merlin I went over all the records available to the public; I used yourletter  Professor  and the head of our Modern History departmentsecured me access to non-public material  some of it still classified For one thing  I have locations and maps and plans of every Federationinstallation built here between 842 and 854  the whole period of theWar undiscovered; most of the important installations were built induplicate  sometimes triplicate  as a precaution against space attack I know where all of them are Space attack!
could have attacked Poictesme  Even if wed had the ships  we werefighting a purely defensive war  Aggression was no part of ourpolicy--that  with all I was able to learn  I could find nothing  not onesingle word  about any giant strategic planning computer calledMerlin  or any Merlin Project Nothing  Conn
Of course  it was the most closely guarded secret    
But after forty years    
Hah  dont tell me about security!
should have seen the lengths our staff went to  I remember  once  onMephistopheles    But there was a computer code-named Merlin 
memory-bank contained all human knowledge  It was capable of scanningall its data instantaneously  and combining  and forming associations and reasoning with absolute accuracy  and extrapolating to produce newfacts  and predicting future events  and    Is there a God
Present 
Wed have won the War  except for Merlin 
Merlin have to beof a hundred thousand cubic feet  For all Merlin was supposed to do Id say something of the order of three million to five million Dawes  the banker  said  Tom Brangwyn said  
out   Lorenzo Menardes asked  
objected  Conn was lifting his glass to his lips  He set it down again and roseto his feet  he said  
 Judge Ledue said  
 Conn replied  
He went on talking  about remote controls and radio transmission andpositronic brains and neutrino-circuits  They believed it all  eventhe little they understood  They would believe anything he told themabout Merlin--except the truth  Lester Dawes said  
 Judge Ledue began  
 That was one of Klem Zareffs fellow planters  
Rodney Maxwell finished the brandy in his glass and set it on thetable  then went to the pile of belts and holsters and began rummagingfor his own  Kurt Fawzi looked up in surprise settled the belt over his hips   he asked

of it  I even caught myself starting to believe it once or twice them the truth  sondidnt I just grab a couple of pistols and shoot the lot of themhave hurt as much There is no Merlin  Is that it
couldnt Youre sure of it
ought to know  The man who commanded the Third Force here during theWar Foxx Travis!
once  when I was eight years old  I thought hed died long ago  Why he must be over a hundred keeps him alive And you talked to him
Yes 
What did he tell you
keeper  Hell have a squad of doctors and a platoon of nurses in hereas soon as youre gone  so take your time  Now  tell me how things areon Poictesme    Just about that 
an old legend people still talked about  I was ashamed to admitanybody really believed in it  He laughed  and said  Great Ghu  isthat thing still around Well  I suppose so; it was all through theThird Force during the War  Lord only knows how these rumors startamong troops  We never contradicted it; it was good for morale Conn  they wouldnt have believed you and Foxx Travis 
something they can shove all their problems onto  As soon as they findMerlin  everybody will be rich and happy  the Government bonds will beredeemed at face value plus interest  the paper moneyll be worth ahundred Federation centisols to the sol  and the leaves and wastepaperwill be raked off the Mall  all by magic I didnt know you were the village atheist  Father 
himself  I have to do business with these Merlinolators  Its all Ican do to keep Flora from antagonizing them at school Floras not a True Believer  then
Id say  You know about him just couldnt believe in it  I dont blame him  Ive heard about itall my life  and I cant Why not
everybody believes  Then  Ive had to do some studying on the ThirdForce occupation of Poictesme to know where to go and dig  and I neverfound any official  or even reliably unofficial  mention of anythingof the sort  Forty years is a long time to keep a secret  you know And I cant see why they didnt come back for it after the pressure toget the troops home was off  or why they didnt build a dozen Merlins This isnt the only planet that has problems they cant solve forthemselves Whats Mothers attitude on Merlin
smarter than people Ill agree  Its scientifically impossible 
Kurt Fawzi started talking about how long it would take to get to theGamma System  you jumped right into it and began talking up a ship Did you think that if you got them started on that it would take theirminds off MerlinMerlin till they die  But I was serious about the ship  An idea hitme  You gave it to me; you and Klem Zareff Why  I didnt say a word    
selling arms and ammunition at a profit of two hundred sols a ton  andKlem was talking as though a bumper crop was worse than a Green Deathepidemic  If we had a hypership  look what we could do  How much doyou think a settler on Hoth or Malebolge or Irminsul would pay for agood rifle and a thousand rounds How much would he pay for hislife--thats what it would come to  And do you know what a fifteen-ccliqueur glass of Poictesme brandy sells for on Terra One sol;Federation money  Ill admit it costs like Nifflheim to run ahypership  but look at the difference between what these trampfreighter captains pay at Storisende and what they get of our own  these planters would be breaking new ground instead ofcutting their plantings  and maybe wed get some money on this planetthat was worth something  You have a good idea there  son  But maybetheres an angle to it you havent thought of lift a finger to build a hypership  Theyve completely lost hope ineverything but Merlin in orbit off Koshchei  I think I could do that you  make no mistake about that  But you and I will be the only twopeople on Poictesme who can be trusted with the truth  Well have tolie to everybody else  with every word we speak  Well have to lie toFlora  and well have to lie to your mother  Your mother most of all She believes in absolutes  Lying is absolutely wrong  no matter whomit helps; telling the truth is absolutely right  no matter how muchdamage it does or how many hearts it breaks  You think this is goingto be worth a price like thatDont you
looking at it for the first time  And then tell me whether itll beworth it or not Great Ghu!
me; I honestly never realized     Yes  Conn  This is a cause worthlying for Sentas  but lets take a few minutes and talk this over  How are yougoing to get it startedit without me  I think Ive done that already  Then convince them thatwell have to have a ship to get to Koshchei  and--has have no idea what all there is  You remember the old Force CommandHeadquarters  the one the Planetary Government took over I know wheretheres a duplicate of that  completely underground  It has everythingthe other one had  and a lot more  because itll be cram-full ofsupplies to be used in case of a general blitz that would knock outeverything on the planet  And a chain of hospitals  And a spaceport over on Barathrum  that was built inside the crater of an extinctvolcano  There wont be any hyperships there of course  but therellbe equipment and material  We might be able to build a ship there  Andsupply depots  all over the planet; none of them has ever been openedsince the War  Dont worry about financing; we have that company organized  a regular limited-liability company  with acharter  Well contribute the information you brought back from Terra and well get the rest of this gang to put all the money we can twistout of them into it  so well be sure they wont say  Aw  Nifflheimwith it! and walk out on us as soon as the going gets a littletough pass the word to Kurt to get a meeting set up for tomorrow afternoon Whatll we call this company Merlin Rediscovery  Ltd
know  this is just a war-material prospecting company  Ill impress onthem that Merlin is to be kept a secret  That way  well have toengage in regular prospecting and salvage work as a front  Ill see toit that the front is also the main objective party 
IV

do youwell go to the meeting in the afternoon Meeting
What meeting
Oh  we didnt have time to tell you 
Conn brought back a lot of information on locations of supply depotsand things like that  An amazing list of things that havent beendiscovered yet  Its going to be too much for us to handle alone;were organizing a company to do it  Well need a lot of labor  forone thing; jobs for some of these Tramptowners Thats going to be something awfully big 
You never did anything like that before 
from now on Whos going to be in this company
Dawes  All that crowd The Fawzis Office Gang 
theyll want Conn to take them right to where Merlin is  the firstthing Well  not the first thing 
couldnt find out anything about on Terra Ill bet you couldnt!
else  and make microcopies and all  but not one word about computers Forty years  and they still have the security lid welded shut onthat you believe in that thingto a thousand light-years They couldnt do all that out of theirheads  Theyd have to have computers  and the one theyd use tocorrelate everything and work out grand-strategy plans would have tobe a dilly  Why  Id give anything just to look at the operatingpanels for that thing No wonder you couldnt find out about it  You were looking forsomething that doesnt exist  just like all these old cranks that sitaround drinking brandy and mooning about what Merlins going to dofor them  and never doing anything for themselves Oh  theyre going to do something  now  Flora 
When we get this company organized--
stuff youve been bringing in from Tenth Army  and then youll golooping off chasing Merlin  like the rest of them  Well  maybe thatllbe a little better than just sitting in Kurt Fawzis office talkingabout it  but not much I have to go 
these children from growing up to be Merlin-worshipers like theirparents again Conn 
gotten Flora started like that she doesnt believe in Merlin  thats her business  A lot of thesepeople do  and Im going to help them hunt for it  Thats why they allchipped in to send me to school on Terra; rememberYes  I know 
believe there is a     that thingWhy  of course 
somewhere on Poictesme  or in the Alpha System Well  do you think it would be a good thing to find it
It frightens me 
it  A soulless intelligence; it seems evil to me soulless  but youre not afraid to ride in one meant to make machines like that  wiser than they are Now wait a minute  Mother  Youre talking to a computerman now 
sort  It doesnt think; the people who make computers and use them dothe thinking  A computers a tool  like a screwdriver; it has to havea man to use it Well  but    
arent meant to do things; they mean to do things  and nine timesout of ten  they end by doing them  It may take a hundred thousandyears from a Stone Age savage in a cave to the captain of a hyperspaceship  but sooner or later they get there Wade Lucas wanted me to drop in on him for a checkup 
just wants to size up his future brother-in-law Well  you ought to go see him 
How did Flora come to meet him  anyhow
for an opening to start a practice  and he heard about some medicalequipment your father had found somewhere and came out to see if hecould buy it  Your father and Judge Ledue and Mr  Fawzi talked himinto opening his office here  Then he and Flora got acquainted    What did you think of him  Conn
Seems like a regular guy  I think Ill like him 
this morning Ah  nice 
that here very often a suit made short jacket like this  or get him to buy himself a shoulder holster Hes ruined every coat he ever owned  carrying a gun on his hip Hello  Conn 
you got all your clothes on this morning  You were just plainindecent  yesterday     You know Fred Karski  dont youWhats going on
againhis colors in the War  and hes in command of the regiment Regiment You need a whole regiment
platoon  but we have to call it a regiment so he can keep his oldRebel Army rank We could use a regiment  Conn 
have no idea how bad things have gotten  Over on the east coast  theoutlaws are looting whole towns  About four months ago  they sackedWaterville; burned the whole town and killed close to a hundredpeople  That was Blackie Perales gang with the Harriet Barne which means practically any outlaw No  Fred; there is a Blackie Perales 
be a planter  down in the south  The banks foreclosed on him when hecouldnt pay his notes  and he turned outlaw  Thats the way itsgoing  all around  Every time a planter loses his plantation or afarmer loses his farm  or a mechanic loses his job  he turns outlaw Take Tramptown  here  We used to plant nothing but melons  Then  whenthe sale for wine and brandy dropped  the melon-planters began cuttingtheir melon crops and raising produce  instead of buying it from upnorth  and turning land into pasture for cattle  The people we used tobuy foodstuffs from couldnt sell all they raised  and that threw alot of farmhands out of work  So they got the idea there was workhere  and they came flocking in  and when they couldnt get jobs  theyjust stayed in Tramptown  stealing anything they could  We dont eventry to police Tramptown any more; we just see to it they dont come uphere come fromsince we organized the Home Guard  They tried to  a couple of times at first  There may have been a few survivors; they spread it aroundthat Gordon Valley wasnt any outlaws health resort Why dont you join us  Conn
belong Id like to  but Im afraid Im going to be kind of busy 
Yes  You will be  at that 
So I hear 
ConnWell  no 
but we will I see youve started carrying one 
if I can protect myself  itll save somebody else the job ofprotecting me trouble are armed  you have to be armed too  When did you last see an AirPatrol boat around here  or even a Constabulary trooper All we havehere is the Home Guard and Tom Brangwyn and three deputies  and hispay and theirs is always six months in arrears every year  currency that buys less every month  And do-it-yourselfjustice your fathers talking about organizingafternoon  arent youYes  Just what are you going to do  after you get it organized
equipment and stores that the Third Force left behind    father and me to handle alone  even if we didnt feel morallyobligated to take in the people who contributed toward sending me toschool on Terra  You ought to be interested in it  I know of six fullysupplied hospitals  intended to take care of the casualties in case ofa System States space-attack  You can imagine  better than I can  whatwould be in them here; youre not going to let these people waste time looking for thisalleged computer  this thing they call Merlin  are youlocation of Merlin  but--Ill bet you dont!
equipment on this planet  In the long run  Id say  more valuable thaneverything else together  We certainly arent going to ignore it educated at the University of Montevideo about Merlin being able to do some of the things these laymen likeKellton and Fawzi and Judge Ledue think it could  Those sorts ofmisconceptions and exaggerations have to be allowed for  But I have nodoubt whatever that the master computer with which they did theirstrategic planning is probably the greatest mechanism of its sort everbuilt  and I have no doubt whatever that it still exists somewhere inthe Alpha System You mean you categorically state that that computer actually exists
Merlin exists 
V

Lets come to order; we must conduct this meeting regularly 
Gentlemen  please; let me have your attention 
Somebody will have to preside 
Would you take the chair  Judge Ledue
Excellent suggestion  Conn  Judge  will you preside
course  Judge  Youre the logical chairman  Here  will you sit hereintroduction to any of you the informal meeting in Mr  Fawzis office  yesterday  Conn  would youplease repeat what you told us Elaborate as you see fit Well  Conn; how about Merlin Thats what were interested in 
and you want him to talk about that idiotic fantasy!the blasphemer!I dont know the exact location of Merlin 
certain that Merlin exists  if not on Poictesme then somewhere in theAlpha System  and I am equally certain that we can find it but youre still certain it existsWhy are you certain it doesnt
Why  the whole things absurdly fantastic!
to me were telling us about  I think Colonel Zareff  here  who served in theAlliance Army  will bear me out that such an attack was plainlyimpossible Intelligence lag 
expect  with General Headquarters thirty parsecs from the fightingYes  A computer can only process the data thats been taped into it 
Poictesme as a low-order probability  but war is the province ofchance; Clausewitz said that a thousand years ago  Foxx Travis wasntthe sort of commander to let himself get caught  even by a verylow-order probability mention  in any history of the War  of Merlin How do you get aroundthatI dont have to  How do you get around it
Huh
Third Force  even to the enemy  Say the stories were unfounded; sayMerlin never existed  Yet the belief in Merlin was an importanthistorical fact  and no history of the War gives it so much as afootnote one thing  Systematic suppression  backed by the whole force of theTerran Federation  A gigantic conspiracy of silence!Now Ive heard everything!
Not quite everything  Doctor 
one of these days  that we have found Merlin Yes  thatll be the day!
to argue with you  Conn Maxwell gave you a thousand-year-oldquotation; Ill give you another  from Thomas Paine: To argue withthose who have renounced the use and authority of reason is as futileas to administer medicine to the dead  Ill add this  Conn Maxwellknows better than this balderdash hes been spouting to you  I dontknow what his racket is  and Im not staying to find out  You will though--to your regret Well  lets get to business 
argue about the existence of Merlin; we know that  Lets discuss thequestion of finding it I still think its somewhere off-planet 
moons of Pantagruel    No  thats too far; theyd keep it where they could use it 
The old GHQ 
like the place Rodney found under Tenth Army I hope not 
over Well  wherever it is  finding it is going to be expensive 
information my son brought back from Terra  Doctor Lucas was rightabout one thing; thats worth millions of sols  Well  I propose  also that we set up a company and get it chartered; a prospecting company to operate under the Abandoned Property Act of 867  My son and I willcontribute this information as our share in the capitalization of thecompany  The work of opening these Federation installations can go onconcurrently with the search for Merlin  and the profits can financeit Well  lets get organized 
companyIt is of the first importance 
objective--Merlin--as close a secret as possible  The PlanetaryGovernment would like to get hold of it--and I leave you to askyourselves how far Jake Vyckhoven and his cronies are to be trustedwith anything like that--and I have no doubt the Federation might tryto take it away from us Couldnt do it  Rodney 
Federation abandoned in the Trisystem is public domain now  We have aFederation Supreme Court ruling--Whats legality to the Federation
fought a criminally illegal war of aggression against my people Banner Black and Green Well  I think its a good idea to keep quiet about it  myself 
All right 
sound like anything but another salvage company  I suggest we call itLitchfield Exploration & Salvage Good name  Rodney 
That a motion I second it 
We cant get all this cleared up now 
appointed    Well  that seems to be cleared up 
meeting day after tomorrow evening; the committees should haveeverything set up  and we should be able to organize ourselves andelect permanent officers  Is there anything else to discuss  or do Ihear a motion to adjournYou heard me mention a spaceport 
that its over on Barathrum  inside the crater of an extinct volcano I think we ought to have a look at that  first of all I know you seemed to think yesterday that Merlin is off-planet 
on Poictesme We ought to nail that spaceport down first 
headquarters here to blitz Poictesme  or they wouldnt have built that  And thisunderground headquarters would be the safest place on the planet;theyd make sure of that  Staff brass dont like to get caught out inthe rain  not when its raining hellburners and planetbusters  Merlinwould be too big to take there along with them  so theyd put it therein the first place I want to find Merlin as much as any of you 
was the only thing I was trained for  Well look there first coast Great Ghu! Well need an army to go in there!
and all Then well get an army together 
make a little of that reward money thats been offered Lots of labor surface; from the plans  Id say they just dug a big pit  built theheadquarters in it  and filled it in  There are two entrances  avertical shaft and a horizontal tunnel the rock at the outer ends at Tenth Army kind of a public-works program here in Litchfield We cant start thistill after the wine-pressings over  and well need a lot of labor  asI pointed out  Now  its important that we keep all our projects asecret until we can get our claims filed  If we start this municipalfix-up-and-clean-up program  we can give work to a lot of thesedrifters who havent been able to get jobs on the plantations  getthem organized into gangs  and keep them together till were ready forthe Force Command job around in Litchfield  we could pick out the best workers  get rid ofthe incompetents  and train a few supervisors  Thats going to be oneof our worst headaches; getting capable supervisors You telling me
about: where wed get gang-bosses  And another thing; this municipalhousecleaning would mask our real preparations Well  we need something like that 
a long time  I guess it took Conn  coming home from Terra  to see howbadly weve let the town get run down  Franz  suppose you and TomBrangwyn and Lorenzo form a committee on that  Look around  see whatneeds fixing up worst  and set up a project  Whos city engineer nowAbe OLeary; he died six years ago 
his successor Well  I guess I never got around to that 
positive  You know  youre only twenty-three  As long as you agreewith those people  youre a brilliant young man; you start gettingideas of your own  and youre just a half-baked kid  You let the olderand wiser heads run things  You cant begin to hope to foul things upthe way they can  Look at all the experience theyve had But weve got to have a ship  Everything depends on that 
the rest of them have this duplicate Force Command thing first though  Keep them happy  As soon as we have that opened  you can takea gang and run over to Barathrum and grab your spaceport  Wait tillthey find out that Merlin isnt at Force Command Duplicate  Then youcan convince them its really on Koshchei 
VI

Nice 
Where did you dig it
Where were going  Tenth Army 
Ill bet shell do Mach Three 
gauge is marked up to four  And she has everything: all kinds ofdetection instruments  cameras  audiovisual pickups  armament  Andthe armor; you can take her through any kind of radiation Still think its worth the price  son
Keep your eye on that  Father 
get rid of If we put this over 
steady work and good homes  We can have a park there  with fountainsthatll work  Maybe even Flora and Mother will think weve donesomething worth doing take it  I can there Sunrise on the east side of Snagtooth; Tenth Armys just behindus  Now  lets see if this airspeed gauge is telling the truth or justbragging shelters theres another one down on that bench  a couple of hundred feet belowthe edge of the plateau  They blasted rock down over that  The mainentrance is a vertical shaft under that pre-stressed concrete dome That was chapel  auditorium  or something  They just covered it withsheet metal and poured a foot of concrete on top Hey  youre looking great  Conn!
somebody had to sit on the lid here  and Jerry Rivas and I cut cardsfor it and Jerry won You didnt tell me Anse was with you 
the birds; Id as soon count sheets of toilet paper as this stuffwere using for money  Sooner  Toilet paper can be used for something and this paper moneys too stiff  Maybe some of this stuff weredigging here isnt worth much  but at least its real Had breakfast yet
back of the kitchen  waiting for the cook to skin it and cut it up either and show him the sights  And dont worry about him bumping you out ofa job  Worry about the six or eight extra jobs youll have to dobesides your own  from now on myself; 90-mm tank gun  When we want a wall out of the way  we get itout of the way dont have the central power on here; theres a big mass-energyconverter  but were tearing it down to ship out The CO here must have had squirrel blood 
the evacuation orders came through he just gathered up everythingthere was topside and crammed it down here  any old way  Honest toGhu  this place was packed solid when we found it  Nobodyd believeit Wait till you see the next one 
You mean theres another place like this
hand grenade  too Litchfield and Tom Brangwyns sending one of his deputies to help boss them  Wellhave to keep an eye on this crowd; theyre all Tramptown hoodlums  butthats the best we can get  Were going to have to get this placecleaned out in a hurry  We only have about two weeks till thewine-pressings over  and then we want to start the next operation Conn  did you see all that engineering equipment  down on the bottomlevelbulldozers and manipulators and so on  We can move it direct to ForceCommand  How are we fixed for blasting explosivesName it and we have it  Cataclysmite  FJ-7  anything you want 
Well need a lot of it 
freighter; first  to move this stuff out of here  and then to move thestuff out of Force Command  And we want it mounted with heavyarmament  too  We not only want a freighter  we want a fighting ship You think so
Im sure of it 
outlaws; there must be hundreds of them holing up over there  Thatswhere all the trouble on the east coast comes from  Now  outlaws aresure-thing players  They want to be alive to spend their loot  andthey wont tackle anything thats too tough for them  A lot of guardsand combat equipment may look like a loss on the books  but the bookswont show how much of a loss you might take if you didnt have them I want this operation armed till itll be too much for all the outlawson the planet to tackle about the older and wiser heads Let me handle them  Ive been aroundthem  heaven pity me  longer than you have  Just give me anaudiovisual of your proxy and Ill vote your stock How much stock do I have  by the way
twenty centisols a share  But watch where it goes after we open ForceCommand it  Thatll keep him out of mischief  Dolf Kelltons secretary; he hasan office force at the Academy and can conscript students to help Hes organizing a research team from his seniors and post-gradstudents to work in the Planetary Library at Storisende  There are alot of old Third Force records there; he may find something useful  Ofcourse  Lester Dawes is treasurer What are you
yesterday log-rolling  baby-kissing and cigar-passing to get And what am I  if its a fair question
stockholder  The only other one is Judge Ledue; as a member of thejudiciary  he did not feel it proper to accept official position in aprivate corporation  Tom Brangwyns Chief of Company Police; KlemFawzi is Commander of the Company Guards  And we have a law firm inStorisende lined up to handle our charter application  Sterber  Flynn& Chen-Wong  Sterbers married to Jake Vyckhovens sister  Flynns sonis married to the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury  andChen-Wong is a nephew of the Chief Justice  All of them are directlydescended from members of Genji Gartners original crew You dont anticipate any trouble about getting the charter
a contragravity ship  There are about a dozen in the hands ofreceivers for bankrupt shipping companies; he might find one thatsstill airworthy  Oh; you remember how I insisted on absolute secrecyabout our Merlin objective Thats working out better than my fondestexpectations  Its leaking like a machine-gunned water tank  andeverybody it leaks to is positive that we know exactly where Merlin isor we wouldnt be trying to keep it a secret Conn  when Flora comes home  you wont argue with her  will you
Only in self-defense 
No; I wont argue with her at all 
Oscar! You stop that!
No  Leo  I dont know when 
You just have space for it  and well fill it up  And dont ask mewhat sort of stuff  You know what a salvage operations like; you justhaul out the stuff as you come to it on the Countess this morning  and Ghu only knows how many in theirown vehicles  and they all seem to think if theres work for somethere ought to be work for all  and some of them are getting nasty are doing all right  once they found out we werent taking anyfoolishness Well  Conn  were in 
Exploration & Salvage  Ltd  And Lester Dawes has found us acontragravity ship How much will it cost us
centisol  You know those old ships on Mothball Row  back of the oldWest End ship docks at StorisendeCommercial Enterprise Encouragement Act  Shes an Army combatfreighter  regimental ammunition ship  Of course  she still hasarmament; well have to pay to get that off Why
weight  We want her for a cargo ship  dont weThats what she was built for  What kind of armament
missile launchers amidships  And a secondary gun battery of 70-mmsand 50-mm auto-cannon  I know the class; we captured a few of them Good ships Patrol  Look  the Government wont like our having anything likethat Theyre giving her to us  arent they
Gehenna with what the Government likes!
theyd put a few of those ships into commission  they could wipe outthese outlaws and a private company wouldnt need an armed ship May I use your screen  Kurt
Theres talk about tearing the armament out 
started on it  I think Ill go in to Storisende tomorrow and see theship for myself  See what I can do about ammunition for those guns too But  Rod 
to start a war taking that ship down into the Badlands  RememberEver hear the name Blackie Perales
You think we really need that  Rod
need  and how hard up were going to be for capable supervisors  Thisthings a training program  Kurt  and well need every man we train onit city find Merlin  everythingll be all right Somebodys been talking!
services on the planet on my screen today; they all want the storyabout whats happening here  Theyve heard we know where Merlin is;that Conn Maxwell found out on Terra They just put two and two together and threw seven 
Herald-Guardian ship-news reporter interviewed me when I got in  andfound out Id been studying cybernetics and computer theory on Terra What did you tell themdidnt believe me  A bunch of them are coming out here tomorrow  Whatare we going to tell them Well all have to have the same story I 
town till theyre gone Why dont you steer them onto Wade Lucas
anything denied  hell do it for you Conn  I know this Lucas is going to marry your sister 
but how much do you know about him
meeting against him  I suppose if Id come from off-planet  I wouldntbelieve in Merlin either Hah! But doesnt he believe in Merlin
He makes noises like it 
You know what I think
Thats why they havent come back to get it long ago Pretty big thing to mislay 
officers whod know where it was  Well  say they all went back toTerra on the same ship  and the ship was lost at space  Sabotage  oneof our commerce raiders that hadnt heard the War was over  maybe justan ordinary accident  But the ships lost  and the location ofMerlins lost with her That could happen 
watching  spying  This Lucas; he showed up here about a year after youwent to Terra  And who does he get engaged to Your sister  And whatdoes he do here Goes around arguing that there is no Merlin  gettingpeople to argue with him  getting them mad  so theyll blurt outanything they know  Im an old field officer; I know all theprisoner-interrogation tricks in the book  and thats always been oneof the best was cut himself off from learning anything more from any of us  In hisplace  would you have done that No; youd have tried to take the leadin hunting for Merlin yourself  Now wouldnt youHow longs he been like that  anyhow
bossing tramp labor and taking care of his money and coming in out ofthe rain  Klem Zareffs as sane as I am  But on the subject of theTerran Federation  hes crazy as a bedbug  What is a bedbug  anyhowlike Tramptown on Terra  too Uhuh  I suppose  in Klems boots  Id be just as crazy as he is 
Kindelburg  on Ashmodai  and the next minute Kindelburg was a puddleof radioactive slag That was in 51  wasnt it I read about it 
famous victory 
VII

Thats it; you can still see where they put off the shots 
Tom 
the screens; Ill transmit to you  Im going in to see whats wrong No 
to study robotics forYou getting it  Klem
go Klem! Whats wrong We arent getting you 
Take the jeep over to the tunnel entrance 
Move out into the tunnel a few feet; relay from me to Klem 
me; Im getting him  Whats the matter with the radio in here Thesnoopers all right  isnt itSure  We just cant transmit out 
Itll transmit clear through Snagtooth It wont transmit through collapsium 
Bring the gang in; its safe as far as weve gotten 
Well just have to string wires out 
Where do you suppose it is
top  I suppose  Lets go up and work down; I cant wait till wevefound it Men and women  all officers or civilians 
even have enlisted men to cook for them  And we havent found a scrapof paper with writing on it  or an inch of recorded sound-tape oraudiovisual film  Remember those big wire baskets  down at themass-energy converters Before they left  they disintegrated everyscrap of writing or recording  This is where Merlin is; they were thepeople who worked with it Its Merlin!
Weve found it!
Hold it!
Wait till I take a look at this thing 
for the records and data of every man and woman in the Third Force forthe whole War  Its like the student-record machine at theUniversity everything; thats personnel  Wouldnt have Merlin in here Well  well just keep on hunting for it till we do find it 
Its here somewhere  It has to be 

VIII

our ten-mile radius thing that even looks like law around here  Id say we have anobligation to give them protection  Have your boats investigate them;if theyre legitimate  tell them they can call on us for help if theyneed it Theres a lot of stuff around here  in small caches 
slacks off here  we could pick that stuff up sometimes  and a bull can make money sometimes  but in the long run  ahog always loses  Let the other people find some of this; itll allhelp the Plan  Fact is  Ive been thinking of leaking someinformation  if I can do it without Fawzi and that gang finding out Do you know a good supply depot or something like that  say over onAcaire  or on the west coast Big enough to be important  and to starta second prospectors rush away from us How about one of those hospitals
us  A lot of medical stores would be a good bait for him  Im afraidhes going to make trouble if we dont do something about him theres a lot of that  down to the southwest that Cant some of you get things started again
place is worse than it was before they started cleaning up Yes  I know 
you opened Force Command  Kurt Fawzis not been back here since dont you just take over  Kurt Fawzi couldnt care less what you do;hes forgotten he is mayor of Litchfield  Hes forgotten there is aLitchfield over    to eat  I suppose you talk to Wade Lucas  Hes got brains  and hes honest--nobody butan honest man would have made himself as unpopular as Lucas has  Ifyou pretend to be disillusioned with this Merlin business it mighthelp convince him the last two weeks  Yes  Hed help get things straightened out Well! I hope you like what youve done!
For a start  yes 
For a start! You know what youve done
Yes  I dont know what you think Ive done  though  Tell me 
world Merlin-crazy  Look at the stock market    roulette with five chambers loaded out of six  Some of this so-calledstock thats being peddled around isnt worth five millisols ashare--Seekers for Merlin  Ltd   closed today at a hundred andseventy  You notice  there isnt any L  E  & S  being traded  If youdont believe me  talk to Lester Dawes; hell tell you what we thinkof this market Well  its your fault!
to play the market with  They wouldnt have money enough to play afive-centisol slot machine if we hadnt gotten a little businessstarted Why  this whole country in here is simply swarming with outlaws  Theyfired on one of our gunboats  the Werewolf  yesterday yesterday outlaw-fighting for us  and as long as the countrys full of smallindependent parties  the outlaws go after them and leave us alone and a lot of the outlaws  too are Federation agents; theyre waiting till we find Merlin  and thentheyll all jump us Well 
admit that  as a possibility  If so  well need heavier weapons thanwe have  This spaceport on Barathrum might be just the place to getthem we grab that place and move all the heavy guns and missiles here  wecould stand off anybody these gunboats  Let me see  Goblin  Fred Karski  And Vampire Charley Gatworth  And Dragon  Stefan Jorisson  Theyre all good men Home Guard; trained them myself Arent you coming  Colonel
here; no telling what might happen  But you keep in constantscreen-contact; if you get into any trouble  Ill come with everythingI can put into the air 
IX

Can you see it  yet
before long Were picking up radiation 
count  I hope the place isnt hot Were getting that  too 
radiation; something must be on there Somethings operating there 
everybody! General alert  Prepare for combat; prepare to takeimmediate evasive action  We must assume that the spaceport isoccupied  and that the occupants are hostile  Captain Poole  will youplease make ready aboard your ship Reduce both speed and altitude and ready your guns and missiles at once Well  now  wait a minute  young fellow 
dont know--No  I dont  And I want all of us alive after we find out  too 
think so    Thats occupied 
going  Now  Fred  dont start any shooting unless you have to  butdont get yourself blown to MC waiting on them to fire the firstshot Missile coming up; counter-missile off!
Grab onto something  everybody!
Be quiet  all of you!
there  Back three or four miles; close enough so they wont dare usethermonuclears  Take cover behind one of those ridges  where theycant detect you  Then we can start figuring what the Gehenna to donext We did  sir; Dragon 
rid of it  We took a hit  Gun turrets smashed  Milt Hennants dead and Abe Samuels probably will be before Im done talking  and if weget this crate down in one piece  itll do for a miracle till a realone happens Well  be careful how you shoot those things off 
wont have any spaceport Fred  how are you and Charley fixed for counter-missiles
carry  Charley  you go up on top of this ridge above  and take coverwhere you can watch the mountain  Transmit what you see back to theship  Fred  you take a position about a quarter way around from whereyou are now  Dont let them send anything over  but dont startanything yourselves  Im coming out with everything I can gather uphere; Ill be along myself in a couple of hours  and the rest will bestringing in after me  In the meantime  Rodney  youre in command Colonel 
of these new prospecting companies  We have no right to take it awayfrom them  have weThey fired on us without warning 
and its ten to one Abe wont live either  We owe them something forthat the spaceport long enough to get the detection system working and putthe defense batteries on ready  They didnt do that since thismorning  and up to last evening they neglected to file claim  Illassume theyre on the wrong side of the law  Theyre outlaws  Conn All the raids along the east coast; everybodys blamed them on theBadlands gangs  Ill admit theyre responsible for some of it  butIll bet this gang at the spaceport is doing most of it Now what did you do
yougot the ship; all the pickups would be smashed before they could seewhat really happened  Youre about ten miles south of that Be withyou in a few minutes Gunboats are only half an hour behind 
screens on to them  Anse; you know the combinations  Now lets seewhat kind of a mess were in here Poltergeist 
Theyre launching missiles faster than we can shoot them down 
Thats usually the beginning of the end 
happen too often during the War  Weve got to get inside that place Its a lot of harmless fun to send contragravity robots out to smasheach other  but it doesnt win battles  Battles are won by men standing with their feet on the ground  using personal weapons Well have to win this one pretty soon 
amount of nuclear energy weve been releasing will be detectableanywhere on the planet by now  The Government has a ship like theLester Dawes in commission; if this keeps on  shell be coming outfor a look Then well have help 
We need Government help like we need the polka-dot fever 
themselves  and well have fought a battle for nothing Look at this 
You know  its possible they dont know that thing exists 
twenty men; fewer than that couldnt accomplish anything Ill be putting mine on the table along with them 
lead them in You better pick the men to go with me  Colonel 
know them better than I do  Well need working equipment  too; I haveno idea what we may have to take out of the way  inside I wont call for volunteers 
they did their volunteering when they joined Let me pick one man  Colonel 
Ill pick me 

X

Who the blazes are they
could have gotten down there Prisoners 
shoved off  and left when the fighting started  Cover me Im going down and talk to them 
Who are you
this gang here Litchfield Exploration & Salvage; Im Conn Maxwell 
Whats going on topside
nuclears  and they herded us down here  Have you cleaned the bloodymurderers outWere working on it 
yoursand passengers    They burned our home and killed our servants 
kidnapped my father and me    Theyve been keeping us here as slaves 
Its the Blackie Perales gang 
of a contragravity ship into a spacecraft  I beg your pardon  CaptainNichols; she was a fine ship--for her intended purpose Youre Captain Nichols
Barneon her  to convert her to an interplanetary craft  of all idioticthings My names Yves Jacquemont 
retired hyperspace maintenance engineer; I had a little business atWaterville  buying  selling and rebuilding agricultural machinery This gang found out about me; they raided and burned our village andcarried me and my daughter  Sylvie  away  Weve been working for themfor the last four months  tearing Captain Nichols ship down andarmoring her with collapsium How many pirates are there here
You get us out of here 
a chance at them How about arms You cant do much with clubs and fists 
house  where they store their loot  Theres plenty of arms andammunition  and anything else you can think of  Theyve used us tohelp stow the stuff; we know where it is to the broad passage Take four men in the jeep; have them lift two ofthem and bring them here  Then  you get out to the end of the tunneland call the Lester Dawes  Tell them whats happened  tell them theycan get gunboats all the way in  and wait to guide them when theyarrive Why does this Perales want an interplanetary ship
Hes crazy!
organizing all the pirates and outlaws on the planet into one band andmaking himself king  Hes heard that there are Space Navy superweaponson Koshchei--I suppose there are  at that--and he wants to get a lotof planetbusters and hellburners and annihilators blow the Harriet Barne up as soon as he got her out of atmosphere Up to the top 
right at the next intersection Lets look these robots over 
can load with blasting explosive and send ahead of us oncontragravity Well  look what youre doing to him!
dirty trick to play on a little robot!treats robots like people they are--but they do what you tell them  and they learn tricks  andthey have personalities ever since I was in pigtails Hi  Conn! You all right
Conns on-screen!
Well  were in  all right 
too Did you hear from Anse
Yes  he just screened in 
can get in Thats right; clear into the crater 
Well  were going to put three of them inside 
flamethrowers  portable machine guns  bomb-launchers; regularspecial-weapons section  What can you do where you arecrater  and then find a vertical shaft and go up topside and make asmuch disturbance as we can Thats it!
get in  well go straight to the top  Look for us in about an hour;its going to take time getting to the tunnel-mouth without beingspotted from above Why did the pirates bother with them
chores for them the men didnt work  Perales threatened to punish the women andchildren  I wasnt doing any housework; Im too good a mechanic  I washelping on the ship them into battle them anywhere and risk having them recaptured cut our striking force down anyhowYoure the officer in command  Conn 
decision  How soon can you attack Were almost through to thecrater top  Well send up a couple of bomb-robots to clear things at theshaft-head and follow with everything we have Noncombatants and all
Only thing we can do 
If you want to make an omelet  you have to break eggs 
you want to make sauerkraut  you have to chop cabbage Wed better send Gumshoe Gus up  first 
Well need him later him 
it 
window-washers; you handle the snooper All right; follow me 
one for Milt Hennant!Well  nice seeing you 
How did you get in
Over the top 
side  We have a quarter of the top gallery  and half of this one  Yourfathers cleaning up above  Klems got some men working along theoutside Hey  look! Look at that!
Whos she belong to
Shes ours 
the egg breakage 
XI

Well  our pay goes on from the day we were captured 
theyre sending a party out to go over her Whats this about the ship
Storisende of her twenty-five men    She still belongs to Transcontinent & Overseas 
law nothing Well  of course  Im prejudiced 
getting us out of the hands of that bloodthirsty maniac and hiscutthroats was nothing Wiping out the Perales gang wasnt nothing  Conn 
years I know  Im sorry 
and now we have no ship at all A ship means something to you
Yes 
hypership of our own  and get our brandy and things to markets wherewe could get a decent price for them for a couple of years before I decided to retire and settle here or Baldur is over a thousand percent Well  dont give up too soon 
Harriet Barne  of course  but youre entitled to prize-money on her and that ought to buy you something you could build a spaceship outof Thats right 
can be made here  Look  these pirates burned me out; except for themoney I have in the bank  I lost everything  home  business and all As soon as I can find a place for Sylvie to stay  Ill come back andgo to work for your company building a spaceship  And a lot of the menwho were working here are farm-tramps and drifters  one jobs as goodas another as long as they get paid for it  And I know a few good menin Storisende--engineers--whod be glad for a job  too stayed with usOf course it would; theyd be glad to have her 
suppose you and I go into Storisende  and    Great Ghu!
ship!Thats the Harriet Barne 
ragged now  but--You helped these pirates do this to her
help them  My throats more valuable to me than the ship is to you; Icant get anybody to build me a new one Well  understand 
her into an interplanetary ship  It wouldnt cost much to finish thejob We need an interplanetary ship like we need a hole in the head!
you think youre entitled to for this wreckcourt  if we can settle it any other way You mean youd litigate about this
Litchfield Exploration & Salvage  But if you do want her  youll haveto pay for her Well give you twenty thousand sols 
to be tightfisted  After all  you fought a gang of pirates and lostsome men and a couple of boats; we have some moral obligation to you But youll have to realize that this ship  in her present state  ispractically valueless even more I worked on them 
Conn  this thing about Merlin 
it Ever since Dad and I came to Poictesme  Ive been hearing aboutit  but its just a story  isnt itthings when we find it looking for it realize that they had Merlin all along and didnt know it Why  look! They got them fixed! Theyre running!
I get you  chum 
Of course theres a Merlin 
Call him  right away; Ritz-Gartner Hotel  in Storisende  Itssomething about a ship Hi  Conn; we have one 
What kind of a ship
You know her  The Harriet Barne 
How the dickens did you wangle that
O s been losing money on her for years  He said if they had to payprize-money on her and then either restore her to original conditionor finish the job and build a spaceship they didnt want  it wouldalmost bankrupt the company  They got up as high as fifty thousandsols for prize-money and we just laughed at them  So we made aproposition of our own Conn shook his head  His father continued:mimicked

Well  are we going to make the whole trip in free fall
deceleration the other half fall about ten or fifteen hours  What were going to have to do willbe to lift off from Poictesme in the horizontal position the ship wasdesigned for  and then make a ninety-degree turn after wereoff-planet  with our lift and our drive working together  just likeone of the old rocket ships before the Abbott Drive was developed Can you spare us Jerry Rivas for a while
operations  As an influential non-office-holding stockholder  Idthink so  Hes only running around helping out here and there telling us about  Wade and I are forming a new company  MainlandMedical Materials  Ltd  Going to act as broker for L  E  & S  ingetting rid of medical stores  Nobody in the company knows where tosell that stuff or what we ought to get for it I really didnt understand how much good this would do 
wouldnt have spoken so forcefully against it if I had  I thought itwas nothing but this Merlin thing--Aaagh! Dont talk to me about Merlin!
talk to Kurt Fawzi and that crowd about Merlin till Im sick of thewhole subject I see Len made you a suit out of that material 
hip-holster in Storisende  Wont even be necessary in Litchfield before long  Ournew marshal had a regular reign of terror in Tramptown for a few days and you wouldnt know the place  Wade  here  is acting mayor now so many companies you wont be able to to keep track of them beforelong Investments  Ltd ; youre a non-office-holding stockholder in that too Theres all sorts of stuff 
in short supply anywhere and that we could get good prices foroff-planet  Get Federation sols for it  too The City of Asgard will be along in six months 
can have a real cargo assembled by then  You can make arrangements inadvance to dispose of it on Terra or Baldur or Marduk ships now freighters off Mothball Row  and theyre tearing them down andcannibalizing them into one spaceship  That works being done here atStorisende Spaceport  And another company has gotten title to a coupleof old office buildings and has a gang at work dismantling them forthe structural steel  I think theyre going to build a realspaceship real spaceships  there are going to be some rare-looking objectstraveling around the Alpha System  I wonder what the next ones goingto look like--a flying sky-scraperWhat I wonder 
interplanetary ships got to  There must have been hundreds of themrunning back and forth from here to Janicot and Koshchei and Jurgenand Horvendile during the War  They must have gone somewhere engines and used in the evacuationhundred to seven-fifty feet in diameter  One of those things couldntcarry more than a couple of hundred people  after you put in all thesupplies and the hydroponic tanks and carniculture vats and so on fora four- to six-month voyage  I cant see the economy of alteringanything that small for interstellar work  Why  the smallest of thesetramp freighters that come in here will run about fifteen hundredfeet I dont know whats the matter with those two 
thing they can agree on is that you and your father ought to stopwhatever youre doing  right away  Your mother cant adjust to yourfather being a big Storisende businessman  and she says hell loseevery centisol he has and both of you will probably go to jail  andthen shes afraid you will find Merlin  and Floras sure you and yourfather are swindling everybody on the planet Sylvie  I had no idea things would be like that 
I wish I hadnt suggested that you stay there  now 
when Flora isnt there  and Flora and I get along when your motherisnt around  Mealtimes arent much fun  though Im glad youre ready to get off 
freighter  the Andromeda Some private group in Storisende haschartered her  Shes loading supplies now  I have a private detectiveagency  Barton-Massarra  trying to find out wheres shes going  Ithink youd better get this ship off  right away We have everything aboard  all the supplies and everything 
We can lift off tonight

Spacemens Hymn 
Its been a long time since I heard that played in earnest 
Well  were off to see the Wizard 
Stand by for shift to vertical 
Ready for shift  Captain Nichols 
here  Captain Shifting over 
Your ship now  Captain Jacquemont 
Thank you  Mr  Nichols 
Course set  Captain 
My private detectives found out about the Andromeda 
computermen with them  one they hired from the Stock Exchange  and onethey practically shanghaied away from the Government  And some of thepeople who chartered the ship are members of a family that wereinterested in a positronic-equipment plant on Panurge at the time ofthe War Theyre just hunting for Merlin were looking for Merlin  Conn out of  If I had Merlin in my hip pocket right now  Id trade it forone good ship like the City of Asgard or the City of Nefertiti and give a keg of brandy and a box of cigars to boot  If we had a shipof our own  wed be selling lots of both  and not for StorisendeSpaceport prices  either But dont you think Merlins important
better one than Jake Vyckhoven Well  we can bunk inside here tonight 
so crowded here fans going That looks like enough oxygen 
Yes  it makes its own ventilation; convection 
you go to sleep in here  and youll smother in a big puddle of yourown exhaled CO2  Just watch what the smoke from that cigarettesdoing Well have to find the power plant  then 
guess how deep this place goes Well find plans of the building 
Ive ever been on  you could always find plans  The troubleshootersalways had them; security officer  and maintenance engineer You know what happened
854  they left the power on  Now the conversion mass is all gone  andthe plutoniums all spent  Well have to find more plutonium  and tearthis whole thing down and refuel it  and repack the mass-conversionchambers--provided nothings eaten holes in itself after the massinside was all converted How long will it take
inside  and if theres been no structural damage  and if we keep atit--a couple of days like these anywhere else  and if we do  thingsll probably be as badthere  We came here to fix things up and start them  didnt we

everythingPort Carpenter; were in the main administration building 
Have you an extra viewscreen  fitted for recording
Yes  right here 
I have it on 
receive ship and a scout-boat in any claims yet  I wasnt sure whether I should make them forAlpha-Interplanetary  or Litchfield Exploration & Salvage Dont bother sending in anything to the Claims Office 
Sterber  Flynn & Chen-Wong file them  Theyll be made for a newcompany were organizing What Another one
weve made application already  We cant claim exclusive rights to thewhole planet  like the old interstellar exploration companies didbefore the War  but since youre the only people on the planet  we cancome pretty close to it by detail beats everything I ever dug  Force Command and Barathrum Spaceportincluded  How big would you say it is More than ten miles in radiusAbout five or six  Ten or twelve miles across 
and the usual ten-mile radius  the same as at Force Command  Wellclaim the place as soon as the companys chartered; in the meantime send in everything else you can get views of find or dont find inside  As soon as the skeletons up they put thearmor on  and then build the rest of the ship out from the middle  Itmight be slower getting material in through the airlock openings  butit holds things together while theyre working Why  this isnt a ship!
outside of a ship  They havent done a thing inside Oh  yes  they have 
in--Abbott lift-and-drive  Dillingham hyperdrives  pseudograv  powerreactors  converters  everything  They wouldnt have put on theshielding if they hadnt  They did that as soon as they had theoutside armor on Wonder why they didnt finish her  if they got that far 
They didnt need her  Theyd had it; they wanted to go home 
Well  were not going to finish her  not with any fifteen men 
can only handle so much robo-equipment at a time I never expected wed build a ship ourselves 
look the place over and get a few claims staked  When weve done that well go back and get a real gang together I dont know where youll find them 
need a couple of hundred  and they ought all to be graduate engineers We cant do this job with farm-tramps You made some good shipyard men out of farm-tramps on Barathrum 
And whatll you do for supervisors
of others  You just keep a day ahead of your men in learning the job youll do all right You know  Yves  hell do it 
he wont believe us  You cant stop a guy like that  All right  Conn;deal me in I wont let anybody be any crazier than I am 
decks and bulkheads  an air-and-water system  hydroponic tanks andcarniculture vats  astrogation and robo-pilot equipment  about which Iknow very little  a hyperspace pilot system  about which I knownothing at all     Conn  why dont you just build a new Merlin Itwould be simpler Merlin  This is what I want  right here finish her  but not with the gang thats here  Well need a couple ofhundred men  Now  with the supplies weve found  we can stay hereindefinitely  Should we do more exploring and claim some more of theseplaces  or should we come home right away and start recruiting  andthen come back with a large party  start work on the ship  and exploreand make further claims as we have timefind out whats going to be needed to finish the ship and whatfacilities you have to produce it  and get things cleaned up a littleso that you can start work as soon as you have people to do it  Imorganizing another company--dont laugh  now; Ive only startedpromotioneering--which I think we will call Trisystem & InterstellarSpacelines  Get me all the views you can of the ship herself and ofthe steel mills and that sort of thing that will produce material forfinishing her; I want to use them in promotion  By the way  has she anameOnly a shipyard construction number 
ship  the one that discovered the Trisystem Ouroboros II; thats fine  Will do 
charter right away  Well have to make Alpha-Interplanetary one of thestockholding companies  and also Koschchei Exploitation & Development and  of course  Litchfield Exploration & Salvage    Ill go back and have a look at the power plant 
its like the rest of this place  itll be ready to go as soon as thereactors are started  I wish everybody here had left things likethis when the main power was cut till we give you the go-ahead Thatll be the control tower for all the machinery in here 
Anse  suppose you and I go take a look at it 
Well take a look at the machines 
work back on the right and then come down on the other side  You knowanything about this stuffMe Nifflheim  no 
one  and I know whether its set to receive or not Theres one big power plant back here 
the middle  It only powers whats in front of it  There must beanother one in either wing  for the isotope plant and thecartridge-case plant  Ill go look at them  But the powers been cutoff from the machines in the main building  Theres four big switches one for each production line--Conn! What did you turn on Turn it off  right away!
Its off 
The dickens it is!
supervisor-robots circling around  and a flock of workers    here  anyhow It didnt do any good  Pull another one 
thats what! The robots have turned on us!it any worse We cant do anything here 
shop-cleaning robots  They were the last things used here when theplace closed down  and the two supervisors were probably controlledfrom a vehicle  and its anybodys guess where that is now  When youthrew that switch  it sent out an impulse that activated them  Theyrerunning their instruction-tapes  and putting the others through alltheir tricks know! I killed one of the buggers!Turn everything off and lets go  See what we can do outside 
Ham  where are you Are you still alive
Im back at the power plant 
big thing circling around here; every time I stick my head out  hemakes a dive at me  I didnt know robots would attack people gather up that aisle is supposed to look like  When you get out in it  he knowsyou dont belong there and tries to grab you converter  Say I chuck one out to him; what would he doGrab it and take it away  like hes taped to do 
Okay; wait a minute 
You want to be careful back there 
reactor-repair robots are there; dont get them on the warpathnext Lets have a look at them  What kind
center Well have to go back to Poictesme pretty soon 
want to go back empty  Well  I know that no matter what we dug up  andwhat we could sell or couldnt sell  theres always a market forpower-unit cartridges  Electric-light units  household-applianceunits  aircar and airboat units  any size at all  We run that plant atfull capacity for a few days and we can load the Harriett Barnefull  and Ill bet the whole cargo will be sold in a week after we getin

Planetary Hymn
everything you saw  and all the places you were  and everything youwere doing    Gartners Body My mother; she didnt get here  Is anything wrong
you went away  Your mothers still moaning about all these companiesyour fathers promoting--he never used to do anything like that  andits all too big  and its going to end in a big smash  And then shegets onto Merlin  You know  she wont say Merlin  she always calls it that thing Ive noticed that 
when its found  and that sets Flora off  Flora says Merlins a bigfake  and you and your father are using it to rob thousands of widowsand orphans of their life savings  and that sets your mother offagain  Self-sustaining cyclic reaction  like the Bethe solar-phoenix And every time I try to pour a little oil on the troubled waters  Ifind Ive gotten it on the fire instead  And then  Flora had thisfight with Wade Lucas  and of course  she blames you for that Good heavens  why
the fight Lucas is in business with your father now  and she cantconvince him that you and your father are a pair of quadruple-dyedvillains  I suppose  Anyhow  the engagement is phttt! Conn  is myfather going back to KoshcheiAs soon as we can round up some people to help us on the ship 
Then Im going along  Ive had it  Conn  Im a combat-fatigue case 
But  Sylvie; that isnt any place for a girl 
on Barathrum; rememberWell  youd be the only girl  and    
together  at least a third of them will be girls  A lot of techniciansare girls  and when work gets slack  theyre always the first ones toget shoved out of jobs  Ill bet there are a thousand girl techniciansout of work here--any line of work you want to name  I know what Illdo; Ill make a telecast appearance  I still have some news value from the Barathrum business  Want to bet that I wont be the workinggirls Joan of Arc by this time next weekYes  I know all about it 
a couple of weeks ago  Flora simply will not speak to me  and yourmother begged me  in tears  to quit everything were doing here  Itried to give her some idea of what would happen if I dropped this even supposing I could; she wouldnt listen to me its costing usmillion people  at least  Why  even these two makeshift ships theyreputting together here at Storisende are giving work  one way oranother  to almost a thousand  Think what things will be like a yearfrom now  if this keeps on altruist for a son Pardner  when you call me that  smile 
I am smiling  With some slight difficulty 
Koshcheilooking for a hypership  We have one  too  Calling her Ouroboros II Twenty-five-hundred-footer  We expect to have her to space in a fewmonths  I surely dont need to tell you what that will do towardrestoring planetary prosperity No  of course not; a hypership of our own  But    
Fawzi was saying    it  thats where itll be found  Im interested in getting businessstarted again  If Merlin is found  it would help  of course Dont look at me 
father and son--want some spaceships  They hired me to help buildthem  Thats all I have in it people have been saying that if Merlins found  it should be used todetermine Government policy  A few extremists are beginning to saythat Merlin ought to be the Government  and Jake Vyckhoven and hiscronies ought to be dumped  Into the handiest mass-energy converter preferably  You know  if anybody found Merlin and started it auditingthe Planetary Treasury  Jake Vyckhovend be the one whod be wanting ahypership Conn  I wish youd come along with me 
in Kurts suite; wed all like to talk to you Im glad you could come  Conn 
could have gotten here  I asked him to come  but he had a priorengagement  A meeting with some of the financial people here  aboutsome company hes interested in Thats right; Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines 
Interstellar!
enough to go out to Koshchei; he wants to go clear out of theTrisystem  Thats what we wanted to talk about; all this nonsense youand your father are in  Merlins right here on Poictesme  Its rightat Force Command  and if your father hadnt robbed us of all our bestmen  like Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes  wed have found it by now  Idont think you and your father care a hoot if we ever find Merlin ornot!Kurt  thats a dreadful thing to say 
Its a dreadful thing to have to say 
me what Conn Maxwell or Rodney Maxwell are doing to help find it Who showed you where Force Command was
MerlinWhy do we    
If you dont know    
I know why I do  I want to see if you do  Do you
Merlin would answer so many questions 
Questions I cant answer for myself 
jurisprudence that would give everybody absolute justice We have a man who joined us after you went off to Koshchei  Conn 
clergyman  from over Morven way  He says that Merlin could formulatean entirely new religion  which would regenerate humanity Well  I dont have any such lofty ideas 
Merlin to show us how to get some prosperity here; bring things backto what they were before Poictesme went broke woods with a book on how to chop down a tree  and no ax markets  If we find Merlin  and tape it with everything thatshappened in the forty years since it was shut down  Merlin will tellus where to find new markets  But the markets wont come to us  Wellhave to do our own exporting  and well need ships  Now  you men havebeen studying about Merlin  and hunting for Merlin  all your lives  Icant add anything to what you know  and neither can my father  Youfind Merlin  and well have the ships ready when you do find it Kurt  I think he has a point 
Youre blasted well right he has 
for Conn Maxwell  you know where wed be Back in Litchfield  sittingaround in Kurts office  talking about how wonderful thingsll be whenwe find Merlin  and doing nothing to find it Kurt  I believe Conn is entitled to an apology 
that we have any hope of finding it at all Conn  Im sorry 
things I did  But were all on edge; weve been having so muchtrouble     Conn  its right there at Force Command; I know it is Weve been all over the place  We have shafts sunk at each of thecorners; weve used scanners  and put off echo shots  Nothing  Welooked for additional passages out of the headquarters; there arentany  But it has to be somewhere around  It just has to be!youve overlooked  And if I cant  Ill try to scrape up some stuff onKoshchei for you  Deep-vein scanners  that sort of thing  from themines Might be something Mr  Leibert thought of 
Then why in blazes didnt he screen us about it
Who is this Leibert
morning  I think He joined us after you left  Conn 
clergyman from Morven  No regular denomination; he has a sect of hisown Yah  he would!
Pious fraud!
use Merlin to show us the true nature of God  and how to live inaccordance with the Divine Will  He says Merlin can teach us a newreligion Welcome  Brothers 
who is this with youwe are about to find the Great Computer  Every sapient being in theGalaxy will honor your name for a thousand years help a few of these people to make a decent living Ill be satisfied young man spiritual values  The Great Computer must not be degraded to suchuses; we should let it show us how to lift ourselves to a highspiritual plane    I tell you  the Great Computer is there  in the heart of the butte 
is completely buried  After it was made  no human touched it  The menwho were here and used it in the War communicated with it only byradio in a dream!away with lying about is what you dream You think hes lying I think hes just crazy 
here; hes trying to keep us from it  Thats why he shifted all thatequipment over on the butte  Hes working for Sam Murchison I thought your theory was that the Federation had lost Merlin 
at Force Command  somewhere  They dont want it found  and theyregoing to do everything they can to stop us  I oughtnt to have leftthis fellow Leibert here alone; well  I wont do that again  Get TomBrangwyn to help me

Our hypership 
two on the agenda  The first thing we need is a ship for thePoictesme-Koshchei run  By this time next year  we ought to have athousand to fifteen hundred people here at the least  We cant haulthem all on that flying sardine can Well need supplies  too  What was left here wont last forever 
And youre going to have to run this at a profit 
youll have to keep the stockholders happy  People like JethroSastraman and some of these Storisende bankers arent going to besatisfied with promises and long-term prospects; theyll wantdividends too  Those ships that are building at Storisende will be finishedbefore long claimed  the first thing you know  well own Port Carpenter andnothing else small ship Just zigzag around the planet and transmit in locations and views ofwhatever you find  and well send it on to Storisende from anything here you halfway around the world to bring back the only specialist insomething yesterday at the latest Are you going to come along  Conn
Oh  Lord  no! Im going to be doing fifteen things at once here 
Are they completely crazy
they know the Government will snatch it as soon as they find it That is precisely Jake Vyckhovens idea 
you he was afraid of Merlin  Hes getting more afraid of it everyday Hail Merlin!
But what 
are the sane people doing
You ought to know 
of them on Koshchei now When are you going to get the ship finished
Fawzis pestering the daylights out of me  He wants that equipment youpromised him revelationCommand  And speaking about Leibert  Klem Zareffs been after me abouthim  You know Ive contracted for the full-time and exclusive servicesof this Barton-Massarra detective agency  Well  Klem wants me to putthem to work investigating Leibert full-time services of the biggest private detective agency onPoictesmebribe and intimidate some of my office help  I have found microphonesand screen-pickups planted around  I caught one of our clerks tryingto make copies of voice-tapes  I think its some of these otherMerlin-chasing companies  trying to find out how close we are to it Klem Zareff is recruiting more guards  But how soon are you going toget that ship builtWere working on it  Thats all I know  now 
off work on that ship were building now  We wont need it Have they found a ship
Where
ships in the Alpha System except the Harriet Barne and the twotheyre building at Storisende  The place is marked on the map asSickle Mountain Naval Observatory  Its just a bitty little dot  butthe map was made before the evacuation started  Its where most of thetroops in the system were embarked on hyperships  I think  Wait till Ishow you the views Great Ghu  are those all ships
Thats right  Look at this one  now 
Now we know where they all went 
Have you screened my father yet
building those ships at Storisende  Im afraid Their tough luck 
issuing stock  and theres been a lot of speculation in it  Thismarkets so inflated now that a puncture at one place might blow thewhole thing out Tell him Ill screen him from Sickle Mountain All right  class dismissed 
your bags packed  Were going to work for real  now Dont worry about a market smash 
taken care of  Trisystem Investments has just bought up a lot of stockin both of those companies  and weve set up agreements withthem--informally  of course; well have to get them voted on by ourown companies--to sell them ships from Koshchei  In return  thecompany thats building the ship out of four air-freighters will go toJanicot  and the company thats building a ship out of the oldLeitzenring Building will go to Jurgen  and theyll both stay offKoshchei  Sterber  Flynn & Chen-Wong will probably be defendingantitrust suits till the end of time  The Planetary Government hasstopped liking us  you know about this time next year  wont thereit  How soon can you get your ships intrip Well  dont forget that equipment you promised Kurt Fawzi 
Well have that on  Jerry Rivas is gathering it up now 
How are you fixed for arms on Koshchei
Marines on duty here  and they left everything they couldnt carry intheir hands  Why The Armageddonists and the Cybernarchists and HumanSupremacy bought all you had on handyour crews might need something to argue their way off the ships atStorisende with  Things are getting just slightly rugged here  now 
XVII

Ship-guard 
off; theyll take care of things  Get your people in that troopcarrier over there  Everybody will stay at Interplanetary Building None of the hotels are safe  not even the Ritz-Gartner  And be sureeverybodys well armed when they come off the ship Venus and Skorvann on Loki  Any law we want  we make for ourselves Somebody here wants to talk to you No  theyre not having anything to do--Duck; quick!
town  Why  no; your mother and Flora arent speaking to either of us any more  Pity  of course  but Im glad theyre in Litchfield  Its alittle healthier there There  you see!
Ive been telling you  Well have to stop this the Mall  the day you came home  I had to was admit him to the lodge and give him the oath alive stopped jumping to conclusions and did a little thinking  You know ever since I came here Ive been preaching to these people to stoplooking for Merlin and do something to help themselves  Youre smarterthan I am  Conn; instead of opposing them  youre guiding them Did you tell Flora
but she wouldnt listen  She just told me Id gotten to be as big acrook as you two time  Some of these days your lucks going to run out How can we stop
us  and then go on hunting for Merlin ended  I was only ten then  but I can remember that very plainly  Wecant stop it  and we wouldnt dare stop it if we could Whats been going on here in the last month
too busy to keep in touch  I know theres been rioting  and thesecrackpot sects  but    happening  There were four attempts to burglarize our offices  I toldyou about some of the other stuff  the microphones we found  and soon  The worst thing was Lucy Nocero  my secretary  She just vanished a couple of weeks ago  Three days later  the police found herwandering in a park  a complete imbecile  Somebody who either didntknow how to use one or didnt care what happened had used a mind-probeon her  Its twenty to one shell never recover Its this Storisende financial crowd 
things all their own way till Alpha-Interplanetary was organized  Nowtheyre getting shoved into the background  and they dont like it Theyre making more money than they ever did  and they just love it 
Murchison Murchison!
Minister-General; all the authority of the Terran Federation  andnothing to enforce it with  He doesnt have a position  here; he has adisease  Sleeping sickness He certainly doesnt believe there is a Merlin  does he
opposite number  He thinks this whole things a plot against theFederation  Its a good thing Klem didnt get around to repainting hiscombat vehicles black and green  the way he did the Home Guard stuffat Litchfield Id be more likely to think it was Vyckhoven 
ashamed to say that this heil-Merlin Cybernarchist gang are friendlyto us  Or it could be some of the banking crowd  or some of theserival space-companies  Barton-Massarra is trying to find out  Well  wehave some of Wades pet suspects at Interplanetary Building now Theres been a meeting going for the last week to partition the AlphaGartner System No statement  gentlemen!
released to all of you The scanning and mining equipment aboard the Helen OLoy 
Command and unload it there fake preacherWell  theyve been busy 
one thing  You heard about the robo-bomb somebody launched at us theday we brought the ships in  didnt youYes  and we heard about the Nocero girl  too 
hasnt it ever occurred to you or your dad that this fellow that callshimself Leibert might be mixed up with the gang that did thatYou suspect him  too
know it; I sent them to some different law-enforcement people over inMorven  where he says he comes from  They never saw him before  andcouldnt find anybody who did Well He just doesnt have a police record  then 
themselves to preach; they get up in pulpits  in front of a lot ofpeople  Those towns over in Morven are small enough for everybody tohave known something about him  Hes a fake  I tell you found out about him  Im beginning to wonder about him myself  Imsure Ive seen him  somewhere    We have things fixed up 
building the ship out of four air-freighters are chartered as JanicotIndustries  Ltd ; theyre going to specialize in chemical products The other company has a charter now  too  Theyre going to operate onJurgen and Horvendile  Well sell them ships  and Alpha-Interplanetarywill put on scheduled trips to all three planets and also Koshchei Were getting along very nicely with them  except that everybodyscompeting for technicians and skilled labor  We have two hundred morepeople signed up for Koshchei  What you want to do is train as many ofthem as you can for ship-operation  Alpha-Interplanetary is going tostart a training program here at Storisende; youd better leave one ofyour ships for them to work on  and send back as many ships as you canfind officers and crews for Were getting things really started 
Yes  The only trouble is    
these people  Conn  Everybody ought to be making millions out of thisby this time next year  but all any of them  even these Storisendebankers  can talk about is how soon were going to find Merlin was on Poictesme; Merlin was a space-station a few thousand milesoff-planet; there was a crew of operators aboard  and theycommunicated with Force Command by radio  When the War ended  theytook it outside the system and shot off a planetbuster inside her  Nomore Merlin  How would that beI doubt  theyd just quit  The market would collapse  everybody wouldbe broke  it would just be the end of the War all over again  Conn  wecant let it stop now  Were going too fast to stop; if we tried it wed smash up and break our necks 
XVIII

Conn  can you come back here to Poictesme for a while
screen--too many people know our scrambler combinations  But I wishyou were here Ship leaving Sickle Mountain tomorrow morning 
aboard Conn  Im scared 
really is a Merlin  after all vaccinated Im beginning to think so  too 
all You know what that gang who took the Andromeda to Panurge found
Merlin  werent theycrew  This place had been turning out material for a computer ofabsolutely unconventional design; the two computermen they had withthem couldnt make head or tail of half of it  And every blueprint every diagram  every scrap of writing or recording  had beendestroyed  But they found one thing  a big empty fiber folder that hadfallen under something and been overlooked  It was marked: TOPSECRET  PROJECT MERLIN Project Merlin could have been anything 
references to Project Merlin  too  For instance  there was a routinedivision court-martial  a couple of second lieutenants  on a verytrivial charge  Force Command ordered the court-martial stopped  andthe two officers simply dropped out of the Third Force records  it wasstated that they were engaged in work connected with Project Merlin Thats an example; there were half a dozen things like that Tell him what Kurt Fawzi and his crew found 
almost to the top of the underground headquarters  They foundsomething on top of the headquarters; a disc-shaped mass  fifty feetthick and a hundred across  armored in collapsium  Its directly overwhat used to be Foxx Traviss office Merlin down to the collapsium on top of this thing; I rode down the shaft ina jeep and looked at it  Look  Conn  we dont know what this ProjectMerlin was; all this lore about Merlin thats grown up since the Waris pure supposition Project military secret any longer  Why would he lie to mea Merlin You lied because telling the truth would hurt them  MaybeTravis had the same reason for lying to you  Maybe Merlins toodangerous for anybody to be allowed to find Frankensteins Monsterlike Foxx Travis would lie if he didnt have some overriding moralobligation to And we know whos been making most of the trouble for us  too 
Yes 
Klem Zareff to kick my pants-seat  Sam Murchison  the TerranFederation Minister-General Howd you get that
Murchisons office  And some of our banking friends got the rest  ThisHuman Supremacy League is being financed by somebody  Every so often their treasurer makes a big deposit at one of the banks here  allFederation currency  big denomination notes  When I asked them to they started keeping a record of the serial numbers and checkingwithdrawals  The money was paid out  at the First Planetary Bank  toMr  Samuel S  Murchison  in person  The Armegeddonists are gettingmoney  too  but theyre too foxy to put theirs through the banks  Ibelieve theyre the ones who mind-probed Lucy Nocero  Barton-Massarrabelieve  but they cant prove  that Human Supremacy launched thatrobo-bomb at us  that time at the spaceport Have you done anything with those audiovisuals of Leibert
Gave them to Barton-Massarra  They havent gotten anything  yet 
want me to domay be a Merlin  we have to assume that it may be dangerous  and wehave to assume that Kurt Fawzi and his covey of Merlinolators are justbefore digging it up  Your job is to see that whatever it is doesntget loose You havent found any passage leading into it
Nifflheim  no! If we had  wed be inside now 
anything but vitrified rock and then the collapsium shielding They do it with cosmic rays But collapsium will stop cosmic rays 
penetrate; it abrades  Throws out a rotary beam and works like agrinding-wheel  or a buzz-saw Well  could you get one down that hole
theres a full-sized power-reactor  and a mass-energy converter  Withthem  you produce negamatter--atoms with negatively charged protonsand positive electrons  positrons  Then  you have to bring them intocontact with normal positive-matte--Thats done in a chamber the sizeof a fifty-gallon barrel  made of collapsium and weighing about ahundred tons  Then you have to have a pseudograv field to impartrotary motion to your cosmic-ray beam  and the generator door thatwould lift ten ships the size of the Lester Dawes  Then you needanother fifty to a hundred tons of collapsium to shield yourcutting-head  The cutting-head alone weighs three tons  The rotarybeam that does the cutting about the size of a silver five-centisol piece where that thing is Thatll take a year 
Oh  no  Maybe a couple of weeks  after we get started 
here than it will to get that thing uncovered and opened Bless you  young man!
Computer! Those who come after will reckon this the Year Zero of theAge of Regeneration  I will go to my chamber and return thanks inprayer Hes been doing a lot of praying lately 
back of the pandenominational chapel on the fourth level down  Alwayskeeps his door locked  too Maybe we could all do with a little prayer Probably praying to Sam Murchison by radio 
Id like to see inside those rooms of his 
humor  I dont know what Fawzi and his gang have here  but if it isntMerlin its something just as hot  We want at it  soonest  and wellhave to dig a couple of hundred feet of rock off it and open acollapsium can How are we going to get that stuff on a ship
last Can you find engines for it And is there anything about thosemining machines or the cutter that would be damaged by space-radiationor re-entry heataround them  No; that stuff can all be hauled open to space  They usethings like that at space stations and on asteroids and all sorts ofplaces  Well have to stop work on Ouroboros  though everybody is going to be rich and happy  and live happily foreverafter You almost said that with a straight face 
of this Merlin stuff you believe So do I  Yves  Maybe after we get this thing open  Ill know 
Ham Matsui and Gomez and Karanja and four or five others  Theyll beready to go to work as soon as she lands and unloads Well  dig out some shootin-irons for them 
need them here Then Im not going either 
stay here and keep an eye on that snake No  nor me 
going to go and pray along with him Genji Gartners Body 
Spacemans Hymn

Go ahead  Flora 
harder than making up with Wade was How did that happen  by the way
Your girlfriend 
forced me into a car and flew me into Storisende  and then made mekeep quiet and listen while Wade told me the truth up I had a pretty good idea  though 
I always hated that Merlin thing 
men in Fawzis office  dreaming about the wonderful things Merlin wasgoing to do  with everything crumbling around them and everybodygetting poorer every year  and doing nothing  nothing! And when youwere coming home  I was expecting you to tell them there was no Merlinand to go to work and do something for themselves  But you didnt  andI couldnt see what you were trying to do  And then when Wade joinedyou and Father  I thought he was either helping you put over some kindof a swindle or else hed started believing in Merlin himself  Ishould have seen what you were trying to do from the beginning  Atleast  from when you talked them into cleaning the town up and fixingthe escalators and getting the fountains going again Hows Mother taking things now
Honestly  I never saw anybody doing that outside a soap opera  Halfthe time she thinks you and Father are a pair of unprincipledscoundrels  and the other half she thinks youre going to let Merlindestroy the world Im beginning to be afraid of something like that myself 
these people do something they wouldnt do for themselves  arentyouIt started that way  What do you think all this is about
like an awful waste of time  though down there  Thats why Im here  instead of on Koshchei  I want tokeep people like Fawzi from doing anything foolish with it when theyfind it But there cant be a Merlin!
that things too small for that  But theres something down there    telecast range News Service story  recently brought to Aton on the Pan-FederationSpacelines ship Magellanic  from Terra Luna    my aide-de-camp on Poictesme     now he thinks hes my keeper    There is absolutely no truth in it  gentlemen 
would have shortened the War by years  We did  of course  usecomputers of all sorts  but they were all the conventional types usedby business organizations    lie Is there no Great ComputerShut up! Listen!
Frankly  Im surprised 
to me  here in this room  a couple of years ago; I told him then thatnothing of the sort existed  If hes back on Poictesme telling peoplethere is  hes lying to them and taking advantage of their credulity There never was anything called Project Merlin    Hah  whos a liar now
people find in the LibraryWhy  thats right!
find a dozen references to Project Merlin  He couldnt be ignorant ofanything like that This youth has been lying to us all along!
false hopes; he has given us faith in a delusion  Why  he is thewickedest monster in human history!Well  thank you  General Travis 
a most excellent statement  sir  It should    Conn  you didnt tell us youd talked to General Travis 
Why didnt you
Fawzis office the day I came home; you know how shocked everybody waswhen I told you I hadnt been able to learn anything positive  Whyshould I repeat his lies and discourage everybody that much more Why hed deny there was a Merlin if he was sitting on top of it Merlin win it for him I dont blame Conn 
some of us might have believed it And look what we found 
Is that Merlin up there  or isnt it
That little thing!
Merlin I am going to my chamber  to pray for forgiveness for thiswretch Stop him  Tom!
Seems to me you lost faith in Merlin awfully quick 
and you never wanted us to find it Leiberts
Knock it off  Franz; he was only doing his duty 
you  General Shanleepretty hot  if they have to send a general to handle it on that interview must have been afraid I didnt believe it  which I didnt  When I wasready to graduate  I got this offer of an instructorship; that was abribe to keep me on Terra and off Poictesme  When I turned it down andtook the Mizar home  Travis sent Shanlee after me  He must havegrown that beard and that pageboy bob on the way out  I suppose hecontacted Murchison as soon as he landed  Wait a minute Protection white beard  alias Carl Leibert Just a sec  Mr  Maxwell 
yet them Let them see those audiovisual  Ill bet that beard was grownaboard ship coming out from Terra Hey  whats going on
Need help Well start a car right away 
Everythings under control  thank you 
that was on telecast a few minutes agohis people  planted here at Force Command  Were going to question himwhen we have time  But there isnt a word of truth in that statementyou just heard on the Herald-Guardian newscast  Merlin exists  andweve found it  Well have it opened inside of thirty hours at most How close are you to digging that thing out
Were down to it; we can start cutting the collapsium any time now 
Start cutting it ten minutes ago 
leave Force Command till you have it open  How many men and vehiclesdoes Klem have for defense Youll need all of them in a couple ofhours  Everybody here is stunned  now; theyll come out of it insidean hour  and theyll come out fighting Youd better come out here 
Start cutting the can open right away Klems just ordered all his force out  Are you coming here
to be here to grab a few of the pieces Youll do a lot of good in jail  or on the end of a rope 
Chance I have to take 
couple of hours  If anybody from the press calls you  what are yougoing to tell themyour end This mans under close arrest 
is very important and very dangerous  Take him out somewhere  searchhim to the skin  take his clothes away from him and give him a robe Hes to be watched every second; make sure he hasnt poison or othersuicide means  Hes to be questioned later Ill take it 
Merlin  and weve found it    
XX

lie! Merlin has been found!defrauded; the Planetary Government is the sole complainantgoing to start a false-arrest suit--If youre alive to 
do you thinks going to happen when the Stock Exchange openssomething like this  He gave me instructions  and instructed a fewmore people as we can  Nobody who keeps his head is going to lose anything in thelong run Well  they caught up with you 
itbefore things get too bad Have you people started on another hypership yet
any more ships in to Storisende for a while And are you sure thisthing youve found is Merlintheyd need to operate a thing like Merlin--Yes  Luther  I am sure wehave found Merlin anything else that can stop this business We searched Leiberts--Shanlees--rooms 
We found a bomb 
What kind of a bomb
by taking apart a couple of light tactical missiles; the whole thingspacked inside a hundred-pound power-cartridge case  It was in atraveling-bag under his bed  And you know how it was to be fired Witha regular 40-mm flare-pistol  welded into the end of the bomb  Theflare-powder had been taken out of the cartridge  and it had beenreloaded with a big charge of rifle-powder  I suppose it would blowone subcritical mass into another  But the only way he could havefired the bomb would have been by pulling the trigger Have you questioned him yet
Not yet  I wanted to tell you about it first 
All right  Tom; well go talk to him  Wheres the Colonel
now  Theres a report of a number of aircraft approaching from thewest now    All right; you can go 
Well take care of him 
You have my name and rank 
My serial number is--
thats all youre getting out of me Well get anything we want out of you 
a mind-probe is You should; your accomplices used one on my fatherssecretary  Shes a hopeless imbecile now  Youll be  too  when werethrough with you  But before then  youll have given us everything youknow Conn  you cant do a thing like that!
A mind-probe is utterly illegal; why  its a capital offense!
Conn I forbid you    
Judge  dont make me call those guards and have you removed 
You can stop bluffing 
mind-probeI should imagine it was to be used in interrogating Allianceprisoners  during the War  I think Colonel Zareff would enjoy helpingto use it on you  He used to be an Alliance officer honor and integrity And would you so describe yourselfconceal the existence of Merlin  And we found that bomb in your room You were willing to blow up this headquarters and everybody  yourselfincluded  in it  to keep us from getting at Merlin  Well  you knowthat we can make you tell us the truth  maybe when its too late  andyou know that we are going to get Merlin  Were cutting the collapsiumoff that thing above now little thing could be MerlinThe controls and programming machine for Merlin 
had it backward  Force Command is inside Merlin What do you mean  Conn
circuitry  the memory-bank  the relays  everything--was installedinside them  Whats up above is only what was needed to operate thecomputer  Isnt that true  Generaljust overpower you and start mind-probing right away  Now; you feelthat suppressing Merlin was worth any sacrifice  Were notunreasonable  If you can convince us that Merlin ought not to bebrought to light     Well  you cant do any harm by talking  and youmay do some good  You may even accomplish your mission He cant talk us out of it 
They just dont want anybody else to have it No  we dont 
breaking up into bloody anarchy  and thats whatll happen if you digthat thing up and put it into operation Would you mind letting me have one of those
havent had a smoke since I came here  It wouldnt have been incharacter Oh  Brother!
your fellow man; that is a sin All right 
truth  which will be something of a novelty all around even caught Merlin short; information lag  of course  The wholeAlliance caved in all at once  Well  we fed Merlin all the dataavailable  and analyzed the situation  Then we did something we reallywerent called upon to do  because that was policy-planning and wasntour province  but we were going to move an occupation army into SystemStates planets  and we didnt want to do anything that would embarrassthe Federation Government later  We fed Merlin every scrap ofavailable information on political and economic conditions everywherein the Federation  and set up a long-term computation of the generaleffects of the War The others  who had taken chairs facing him  looked at him blankly  Judge Ledue asked incredulously  
The Federation would last forever  Anybody knew that  There justcouldnt be no more Federation  Shanlee said  
Government will collapse  slowly  The Space Navy will disintegrate Planets and systems will lose touch with Terra and with one another You know what it was like here  just before the War It will be likethat on every planet  even on Terra  Just a slow crumbling  tilleverything is gone; then every planet will start sliding back  inisolation  into barbarism Merlin predicted that
publication of this prognosis  You know  Merlin cant predict what youor I would do under given circumstances  but Merlin can handlelarge-group behavior with absolute accuracy  If we made publicMerlins prognosis  the end would come  not in two centuries but inless than one  and it wouldnt be a slow  peaceful decay; it would bea bomb-type reaction  Rebellions  Overthrow of Federation authority and then revolt and counterrevolt against planetary authority Division along sectional or class lines on individual planets Interplanetary wars; what we fought the Alliance to prevent  Left inignorance of the future  people would go on trying to make do withwhat they had  But if they found out that the Federation was doomed everybody would be trying to snatch what they could  and end bysmashing everything  Left in ignorance  there might be a planet hereand there that would keep enough of the old civilization to serve  infive or so centuries  as a nucleus for a new one  Informed in advanceof the doom of the Federation  they would all go down together in thesame bloody shambles  and there would be a Galactic night of barbarismfor no one knows how many thousand years We dont want anything like that to happen!
with it No! Well not do that!
tries it!Why didnt you people blow Merlin up
part of it  We couldnt  Besides  there was a chance that it mightsurvive the Federation; when a new civilization arose  it would beuseful  We just sealed it  There were fewer than a hundred of us whoknew about it  We all took an oath of secrecy  We spent the rest ofour lives trying to suppress any mention of Merlin or the MerlinProject  You have no idea how shocked both General Travis and I werewhen you told us that the story was still current here on Poictesme And when we found that youd been getting into the records of theThird Force  I took the next ship I could  a miserable littlefreighter  and when I landed and found out what was happening  Icontacted Murchison and scared the life out of him with stories abouta secessionist conspiracy  All this Armageddonist  Human Supremacy Merlin-is-the-Devil  stuff thats been going on was started byMurchison  And he succeeded in scaring Vyckhoven with theCybernarchists  too back-work fileme beg  again  that you destroy the whole thing Well have to talk it over among ourselves 
five of us  here  cannot presume to speak for everybody  We will  ofcourse  have to keep you confined; I hope you will understand that wecannot accept your parole Is there anything you want in the meantime
I would like something to smoke  and some clothes 
And a shave and a haircut

You think it would make all that trouble
Maybe we had better destroy it 
its done already; the whole planets in anarchy  If we let this goon    We cant decide anything like that  just the five of us 
they think  We have no right to make any decision like this for them Theyre no more able to make the decision than we are 
But weve got to; they have a right to know    
first Im alive But  Kurt 
Storisende are rioting Its because theyve lost hope  becausetheyre afraid and desperate  The Terran Federation is somethingeverybody feels they have to have  for peace and order and welfare  Ifpeople thought it was breaking up  theyd be desperate  too  Theyd dothe same insane things these people here on this planet are doing General Shanlee was right  Dont destroy the hope that keeps themsane We dont need to do that 
solve our own problems; we dont need to tell the whole Federationwhats going to happen in two hundred years It would get out; it couldnt help getting out 
Lets not try to decide it ourselves 
into operation  and run a computation on it notsentence itself to destructionmachines; they have no sense of self-preservation  If Merlin ought tobe destroyed  Merlin will tell us so You willing to leave it up to Merlin  Kurt
Yes  If Merlin says we ought to  well have to do it 
do not want to use genocidal weapons of mass destruction against theworld of our birth  But whether we do or not rests solely with you Federation naval base and naval arsenal during the War  Here theFederation Navy built their super-missiles  the missiles whichdevastated Ashmodai  and Belphegor  and Baphomet  and hundreds ofthese weapons are here  We have them  ready for launching  Once theyare launched  with the robo-pilots set for targets on Poictesme  youwill have a hundred and sixty hours  at the most  to live dreadful thing  We speak to each one of you  for each one of you holdsthe fate of the planet in his own hands They wouldnt do it  would they
you know those people  They wouldnt reallyDont depend on it  Lorenzo 
of people to shoot somebody ten feet away with a pistol  But justsending off a missile; thats nothing but setting a lot of dials andthen pushing a button Im not worrying about whether theyd do it or not 
Im worrying about is how many people will believe they will What happened
They let you out on bail
to charge me with in the first place  But they havent let me outyet Youre wearing your guns 
theyre practically keeping me in the safe  I wish our people onKoshchei hadnt mentioned me in their ultimatum; Jake Vyckhovensafraid to let me run around loose for fear some lunatic shoots me andstarts the planetbusters coming in  Jake did one good thing  though He ordered the Stock Exchange closed  and declared a five-day bankholiday  By that time  you ought to have Merlin opened and working and then the marketll be safe I hope so 
might talk them into letting you come out hereI can try 
I would have come sooner 
collapse  It happened last evening; shes in the hospital  I was withher until just an hour and a half ago  Shes still unconscious You mean shes in danger
was the Travis statement that did it Think I ought to go to her
isnt anything you can do for her now lying about Merlin There isnt anything we can do  Father 
when theres any change get that infernal thing uncovered  Once we do this  everythingll beall right  Well show your mother that it isnt a fake and it isntanything dangerous; well put a stop to all these horror-stories aboutmechanical devils and living machines    This is something worse 
the whole Federation Are you going nuts  too
Do you believe that
you saw how people acted  If this story gets out  people will beacting the same way on every planet in the Federation  Not just placeslike Poictesme; planets like Terra and Baldur and Marduk and Odin andOsiris  It would be the end of everything civilized  everywhere Why didnt they use Merlin to save the Federation
was what gave it the final shove  If they could have used Merlin toreverse the process  they wouldnt have sealed it away people who went crazy over the Travis statement would go crazy allover again  worse than ever  Wed be destroying everything we plannedfor  and wed be destroying ourselves  That bluff young Macquarte andLuther Chen-Wong and Bill Nichols made wouldnt work twice  And ifthey werent bluffing    if it blows up all over the rest of the FederationWell  you got it open 
Now  what are you going to do with it
We cant make up our minds 
computer tell us what to do with it Merlin judge itself and decide its own fatethe same result we did Powered from the central plant  down below 
cables are disguised as the grounding-outlet  If this thing had beenon when you put on the power  youd have had an awful lot of powergoing nowhere  apparently complex  but Id have expected there to be more of it operating end This is the real computer 
where Merlin was; it was all around them Well  how did you get up here
anything from below No  you couldnt 
Watch this 
Thats it 
patched it up a little  Theres a sheet of collapsium-plate under thefloor  Your scanners simply couldnt detect anything from below You know  we can keep the destruction of Merlin a secret 
the circuits and burn everything out at once I dont know why you people didnt think of that 
neither do I We just didnt 
Then 
room thatll turn out what will look like computation results  As faras anybody outside ourselves will know  Merlin will still be solvingeverybodys problems  Well do like any fortuneteller; tell thecustomer what he wants to believe and keep him happy Shes still unconscious  Conn 
breathing  The doctors dont know     I wish Wade hadnt gone on theship General; youre the oldest Merlin hand 
You do it 
You do it  Conn  None of us would be here except for you 
Thank you  General 
We cant begin to handle this without Merlin 
means blowing up the Federation  let it blow  Well start a new onehere spread to Poictesme question So Merlins got to be a liar  too  along with the rest of us!
Conn  youve corrupted his morals!
Well  thats it

shoot a dog  He has no dog  He intends shooting his wife  Dont argueabout how I know; there isnt time  Just take it for granted that I do I disabled the pistol--took out the firing pin--but if he finds out whatI did  he may get some other weapon  Hes on his way home  but hes onfoot  If you hurry  you may get a man there before he arrives  and grabhim before he finds out the pistol wont shoot O  K   Mr  Hartley  Well take care of it  Thanks 
I brought home from the other War  and I shouldnt like to lose it Well take care of that  too  Thank you  Mr  Hartley 
Look  Mr  Gutchall; heres how it works 
Its ready to shoot  now; this is the safety 
then pull the trigger  You have to pull the trigger each time; itsloaded for eight shots  And be sure to put the safety back when yourethrough shooting Did you load the chamber
Sure  Its on safe  now 
Let me see 
right works  nowyoung man You shouldnt have loaded it 
I had to  to keep you from fooling with it

to shoot his wife with it  Hes a religious maniac; sees visions  hearsvoices  receives revelations  talks with the Holy Ghost  The Holy Ghostprobably put him up to this caper  Ill submit that any man who holdslong conversations with the Deity isnt to be trusted with a gun  andneither is any man who lies about why he wants one  And while I was atit  I called the police  on the upstairs phone  I had to use your name;I deepened my voice and talked through a handkerchief You--
do thatjust thirteen years old; please  Mr  Policeman  go and arrest FrankGutchall before he goes root-toot-toot at his wife with my pappasLuger  That would have gone over big  now  wouldnt itbe init  myself  Itll pass for a dumb kid trick  and nothingll be done  Butif Im right  youll have to front for me  Theyll keep your name out ofit  but theyd give me a lot of cheap boy-hero publicity  which I dontwant returns in about twenty minutes Well 
you were right  You saved that womans life 
lets see you put that firing pin back Now  son  suppose we have a little talk 
But I explained everything 
You did not 
of a trick like this; why  you wouldnt even have known how to take thispistol apart  And at dinner  I caught you using language and expressingideas that were entirely outside anything youd ever known before  Now I want to know--and I mean this literally notion of obsession The trouble is  Im not sure you arent right 
say you find me--changed  When did you first notice a differenceLast night  you were still my little boy  This morning--
unusually silent at breakfast  And come to think of it  there wassomething     something strange     about you when I saw you in thehall  upstairs     Allan!to youI wish I could be sure  myself  Dad 
this morning  I hadnt the least recollection of anything Id doneyesterday  August 4  1945  that is convinced that I was a man of forty-three  and my last memory was oflying on a stretcher  injured by a bomb explosion  And I was equallyconvinced that this had happened in 1975 Huh
Did you say nineteen seventy-five
forty-three  A bomb  you sayDuring the siege of Buffalo  in the Third World War 
been a transpolar air invasion of Canada  and Id been sent to the frontto check on service failures of a new lubricating oil for combatequipment  A week after I got there  Ottawa fell  and the retreatstarted  We made a stand at Buffalo  and that was where I copped it  Iremember being picked up  and getting a narcotic injection  The nextthing I knew  I was in bed  upstairs  and it was 1945 again  and I wasback in my own little thirteen-year-old body Oh  Allan  you just had a nightmare to end nightmares!
Thats all!
just wouldnt fit the facts  Look; a normal dream is part of thedreamers own physical brain  isnt it Well  here is a part about twothousand per cent greater than the whole from which it was taken  Whichis absurd commentators have been harping on the horrors of World War III  and youcouldnt have avoided hearing some of it  You just have an undigestedchunk of H  V  Kaltenborn raising hell in your subconscious school  and my four years at Penn State  and my seven years as areporter on the Philadelphia Record  And my novels: Children of theMist  Rose of Death  Conquerors Road  They were no kid stuff Why  yesterday Id never even have thought of some of the ideas I usedin my detective stories  that I published under a nom-de-plume  And myhobby  chemistry; I was pretty good at that  Patented a couple ofprocesses that made me as much money as my writing  You think athirteen-year-old just dreamed all that up Or  here; you speak French dont youtoo could cut with a machete  Im even better there than in French  And Iknow some German  and a little Russian I could barely keep up with you  in French 
that in the last thirteen years of your life  you had absolutely nochance to learn it  All right; you lived till 1975  you say  Then  allof a sudden  you found yourself back here  thirteen years old  in 1945 I suppose you remember everything in betweenread James Branch Cabell Remember Florian de Puysange  in The HighPlaceYes  You find the same idea in Jurgen too 
Im beginning to wonder if Cabell mightnt have known something hedidnt want to write But its impossible!
time you claim you came from doesnt exist  now; it hasnt happenedyet with Time Psychical Phenomena  Are you trying to work out a theoryYes 
Youve read these books Well  look  Dad; whats your attitude onprecognition The ability of the human mind to exhibit real knowledge apart from logical inference  of future events You think Dunne istelling the truth about his experiences Or that the cases in Tyrrellsbook are properly verified  and cant be explained away on the basis ofchanceI dont know 
the sort that any court in the world would accept  if it concernedordinary  normal events  Especially the cases investigated by theSociety for Psychical Research: they have been verified  But how cananybody know of something that hasnt happened yet If it hasnthappened yet  it doesnt exist  and you cant have real knowledge ofsomething that has no real existence can  If somebody has real knowledge of the future  then the future mustbe available to the present mind  And if any moment other than the barepresent exists  then all time must be totally present; every moment mustbe perpetually coexistent with every other moment Yes  I think I see what you mean  That was Dunnes idea  wasnt it
extent of each being the bare present moment of the next  What Impostulating is the perpetual coexistence of every moment of time in thisdimension  just as every graduation on a yardstick exists equally withevery other graduation  but each at a different point in space Well  as far as duration and sequence go  thats all right 
But how about the Passage of Time
moving car window  Ill suggest that both are illusions of the samekind  We imagine time to be dynamic  because weve never viewed it froma fixed point  but if it is totally present  then it must be static  andin that case  were moving through time That seems all right  But whats your car window
every moment along your individual life span physical body  and your mind  and all the thoughts contained in yourmind  each at its appropriate moment in sequence  But what is it thatexists only at the bare moment we think of as nowPlease  teacher; what
But were only conscious of one moment; the illusory now  This is now and it was now when you asked that question  and itll be now when Istop talking  but each is a different moment  We imagine that all thosenows are rushing past us  Really  theyre standing still  and ourconsciousness is whizzing past them Hey!
moment to moment  it must be extraphysical  because the physical bodyexists at every moment through which the consciousness passes  And ifits extraphysical  theres no reason whatever for assuming that itpasses out of existence when it reaches the moment of the death of thebody  Why  theres logical evidence for survival  independent of anyalleged spirit communication! You can toss out Patience Worth  and Mrs Osborne Leonards Feda  and Sir Oliver Lodges son  and Wilfred Brandon and all the other spirit-communicators  and you still have evidence I hadnt thought of that 
Well  lets put that at the bottom of the agenda and get on with thistime business  You lose consciousness as in sleep; where does yourconsciousness go I think it simply detaches from the moment at whichyou go to sleep  and moves backward or forward along the line ofmoment-sequence  to some prior or subsequent moment  attaching there Well  why dont we know anything about that
never seems to happen  We go to sleep tonight  and its always tomorrowmorning when we wake; never day-before-yesterday  or last month  or nextyear Know why Because if the consciousness goes forward  it attaches at amoment when the physical brain contains memories of the previous consciously unexperienced  moment  You wake  remembering the eveningbefore  because thats the memory contained in your mind at that moment and back of it are memories of all the events in the interim  SeeYes  But how about backward movement  like this experience of yours
case like it  What usually happens is that the memories carried back bythe consciousness are buried in the subconscious mind  You know howthick the wall between the subconscious and the conscious mind is  Thesedreams of Dunnes  and the cases in Tyrrells book  are leakage  Thatswhy precognitions are usually incomplete and distorted  and generallytrivial  The wonder isnt that good cases are so few; its surprisingthat there are any at all It may have been the radiations from the bomb  or the effect of thenarcotic  or both together  or something at this end  or a combinationof all three  But the fact remains that my subconscious barrier didntfunction  and everything got through  So  you see  I am obsessed--by myown future identity outsider that whats happened has been a shock  But that other     I justcouldnt have taken that was yesterday  Ive just had what you might call an educational shortcut Ill say you have!
the next thirty years  suppose you tell me when the Wars going to end This one  I mean present style--on August 14  A week from Tuesday  Better make sure wehave plenty of grub in the house by then  Everything will be closed uptight till Thursday morning; even the restaurants  I remember  we hadnothing to eat in the house but some scraps Stauber gets plenty of groceries in     Tuesday a week Thats prettysudden  isnt itThe Japs are going to think so 
but I thought it was just Buck Rogers stuff  Was that the sort of bombthat got yougood ten miles away years! You know  son  if I were you  I wouldnt like to have to knowabout a thing like that you know  dont ever tell me when Im going to die the front  You were seventy-eight  then  and you were still hunting  andfishing  and flying your own plane  But Im not going to get killed inany Battle of Buffalo  this time  and if I can prevent it  and I think Ican  there wont be any World War III present youre getting closer to it  every watch tick Gutchall came to borrow a gunhadnt been home: Id been swimming at the Canoe Club  with LarryMorton  When I got home  about half an hour from now  I found the housefull of cops  Gutchall talked the  38 officers model out of you  andgone home; hed shot his wife four times through the body  finished heroff with another one back of the ear  and then used his sixth shot toblast his brains out  The cops traced the gun; they took a very poorview of your lending it to him  You never got it back Trust that gang to keep a good gun 
lose face around City Hall  Gutchalls  of course  are expendable cell was that I wanted to know whether or not the future could bealtered  I have it on experimental authority that it can be  There mustbe additional dimensions of time; lines of alternate probabilities Something like William Seabrooks witch-doctor friends Fan-ShapedDestiny  When I brought memories of the future back to the present  Iadded certain factors to the causal chain  That set up an entirely newline of probabilities  On no notice at all  I stopped a murder and asuicide  With thirty years to work  I can stop a world war  Ill havethe means to do it  too The means

What did you make this out of  Jim
notes while you were concocting it  Its good The two smoked pork chops left over from yesterday evening 
in the refrigerator the last couple of days  together with alittle egg powder and some milk  I ground the chops up and mixedthem with the rice and other stuff  Then added some bacon  tomake grease to fry it in Caffchoc
Did you ever drink coffee  Monty
organize an expedition to Brazil  sometime  to get seeds and tryraising some A much overrated beverage 
when I was on that expedition into Idaho  in what must have beenthe stockroom of a hotel  Vacuum-packed in moisture-proofcontainers  and free from radioactivity  It wasnt nearly as goodas caffchoc Loudons looked forward  up the river they were following   he asked  
Altamont got out his pipe and tobacco pouch  filling the formerslowly and carefully That was Loudons  too  Altamont thought  There wasnt a betterman at the Fort  when it came to dealing with people  Butconfront him with a problem about things and he was lost That was one of the reasons why he and the stocky  phlegmatic socialscientist made such a good team  he thought  As far as he  himself was concerned  people were just a mysterious  exasperatinglyunpredictable order of things which were subject to no known naturallaws And Loudons thought the same thing about machines: he couldntpsychoanalyze them Altamont gestured with his pipe toward the nuclear-electricconversion unit  between the control-cabin and the livingquarters in the rear of the boxcar-sized helicopter  he said  
Altamont looked across the cabin at the big map of the UnitedStates as they had been  the red and green and blue and yellowpatchwork of vanished political divisions  The colors gleamedthrough the transparent overlay on which this voyage ofre-discovery was plotted The red line of their journey started at Fort Ridgeway  in whathad been Arizona  It angled east by a little north  to ColonyThree  in northern Arkansas     sharply northeast to St  Louisand its lifeless ruins     then to Chicago and Gary  where littlebands of Stone Age reversions stalked and fought and ate eachother     Detroit  where things that had completely forgottenthey were human emerged from their burrows only at night    Cleveland  where a couple of cobalt bombs must have landed in thelake and drenched everything with radioactivity that stilllingered after two centuries     Akron  where vegetation was onlybeginning to break through the glassy slag     Cincinnati  wherethey had last stopped    transparent nose of the copter at a town  now choked with treesthat grew among the tumbled walls  Loudons looked and shrugged  then looked again and pointed Altamont puffed slowly at his pipe  wiping his mustache with the back of his hand  Altamont said   Loudons qualified  
They passed over a dam of flotsam that had banked up at awrecked bridge and accumulated enough mass to resist the periodicfloods that had kept the river usually clear  Three human figuresfled across a sand-flat at one end of it and disappeared into thewoods  Two of them carried spears tipped with something thatsparkled in the sunlight  probably shards of glass Five or six wild cows went crashing through the brush below Altamont nodded when he saw them  he said  
He looked across the table   he asked Loudons  
They rose  and Loudons  favoring his left leg  moved over to theseat at the controls Altamont gathered up the two cups  the stainless-steel dishes and the knives and the forks and spoons  going up the steps overthe shielded converter and ducking his head to avoid the seat inthe forward top machine-gun turret  He washed and dried thedishes  noting with satisfaction that the gauge of the water tankwas still reasonably high  and glanced out one of the windows Loudons was taking the big helicopter upstairs  for a betterview Now and then  among the trees  there would be a glint of glassyslag  usually in a fairly small circle  That was to be expected:beside the three or four H-bombs that had fallen on thePittsburgh area  mentioned in the transcripts of the last news toreach the Fort from the outside  the whole district had beenpelted  more or less at random  with fission bombs West of the confluence of the Allegheny and the Monongahela  itwould probably be worse than this Picking up the pipe he had laid down  Altamont hurried forward dodging his six-foot length under the gun turret and swingingdown from the walkway over the converter Loudons had shifted from Forward to Hover and was peering througha pair of binoculars

Look  strip farming 
of grass and plowed ground  These people understand soilconservation As he spoke  three riders left the village at a gallop  Theyseparated  and the people in the fields  who had all started forthe village  turned and began hurrying toward the woods  Two ofthe riders headed for a pasture in which cattle had been grazingand started herding them also into the woods For a while  there was a scurrying of little figures in thevillage below  Then  not a moving thing was in sight  Loudons said  
you understand their background and their social organization what kind of people they are water-power sawmill--building on the left side of the waterwheel  see the pile of fresh lumber beside it  Blacksmith shop and from that chimney  Id say a small foundry  too Altamont started to object  paused  and then nodded  thought for a moment  The plaza  the houses and the cabins around it  thetwo-hundred-year-old church  all were silent and apparentlylifeless as they set the helicopter down  Once Loudons caught amovement inside the door of a house  and saw a metallic glint  he said  
That would be where theyd put it  Probably extract their niterfrom the dung of their horses and cows  Sulfur probably fromcoal-mine drainage looking apprehensively at the brass-rimmed black muzzle that wascovering them from the belfry  Three or four young men stepped out of the wide door of the oldchurch  They wore fringed buckskin trousers and buckskin shirtsand odd caps of deerskin with visors to shade the eyes andsimilar beaks behind to protect the neck  They had powder hornsand bullet pouches slung over their shoulders  and long rifles intheir hands  They stepped aside as soon as they were out Carefully avoiding any gesture of menace  they simply stood watching the helicopter which had landed in their village Three other men followed them out  They  too  wore buckskins andthe odd double-visored caps  One had a close-cropped white beard and on the shoulders of his buckskin shirt  he wore the singlesilver bars of a first lieutenant of the vanished United StatesArmy  He had a pistol on his belt  The pistol had the saw-handlegrip of an automatic  but it was a flintlock  as were the riflesof the young men who stood so watchfully on either side of thedoor Two middle-aged men accompanied the bearded man and the trioadvanced toward the helicopter Loudons opened the door and let down the steps  Picking up anauto-carbine  he slung it and stepped out of the helicopter Altamont behind him  They advanced to meet the party from thechurch  halting when they were about twenty feet apart Loudons stopped  wondering if the man with the white beardunderstood a word of what he was saying man replied  The old mans eyes sparkled with child-like pleasure  cloth around it is stained with blood  Through the rip  Iperceive a bandage  Obviously  you have suffered a recent wound I further observe that the side of your flying machine bearsrecent scratches  as though from the spears or throwing hatchetsof the Scowrers  Evidently  they attacked you as you werelanding  It is fortunate that these cannibal devils are toostupid and too anxious for human flesh to exercise patience attacked been to the west of here  in a ruined cityI never guess

and shouted up at the truncated steeple: A horn up in the belfry began blowing  apparently to advise thepeople who had run from the fields into the forest that there wasno danger They went through the open doorway of the old stone church andentered the big room inside  The building had evidently once beengutted by fire  two centuries ago  but portions of the wall hadbeen restored  The floor had been replaced by one of roughplanks  and there was a plank ceiling at about ten feet The room was apparently used as a community center  There were anumber of benches and chairs  all very neatly made; and along onewall  out of the way  ten or fifteen long tables had beenstacked  the tops in a pile and the trestles on the tops The walls were decorated with trophies of weapons--a number ofM-12 rifles and M-16 submachine-guns  all in good  cleancondition; a light machine rifle; two bazookas  Among them werecruder weapons  stone-and metal-tipped spears and clubs  the workof the wild men of the woods A stairway led to the second floor  and it was up this stairwaythat the man who bore the title of Toon Leader conducted them  toa small room furnished with a long table  a number of chairs  andseveral big wooden chests bound with iron cupboard and producing a large bottle stoppered with a corncoband a number of small cups  he went on  
You smoke a pipe  I take it
of this  of our own growth and curing You come  then  from the west
Are you from Utah
Why  no  were from Arizona  A place called Fort Ridgeway 
You say you come from a fort Then the wars arent over yet
they were  You know how few in all the countries were leftalive you came have managed to save anything of the Old Times  Most of themlived in little villages and cultivated land  A few had horses orcows  None  that we have ever found before  made guns and powderfor themselves  But they remembered that they were men  and didnot eat one another  the Toon Leader asked  
He was speaking to Altamont  rather than to Loudons  It seemedobvious that he believed Altamont to be the leader and Loudonsthe subordinate Altamont told him  looked at Loudons  aware that his partner should be talking now and also suddenly aware that Loudons had recognized the situationand left the leadership up to him    beasts will soon be no more Hes right  One of us  alone  is helpless 
is only in the Toon that there is strength  He wants to organizea Toon of all Toons one Loudons and I came in  Well furnish your community with oneor more of them  We can give you a radio  so that you cancommunicate with other communities  We can give you rifles andmachine guns and ammunition  to fight the--the Scowrers  did youcall them And we can give you atomic engines  so that you canbuild machines for yourselves Markovitch  the distiller  and Harrison Grant  the iron-worker--gettheir living by making things  Howd they make out  after your machinescame in hereweve helped everything in common and so we dont have much of a problem  Isthat the way you do it  hereor catches it in the woods  its his who are already in a trade  or something like that  Well have totalk it over with you and with the people concerned How is it you took so long finding us
Its been two hundred or so years since the Wars 
Alex! You see but you do not observe!
complicated mechanisms  They would have to make tools andmachines to make them  and tools and machines to make those toolsand machines  They would have to find materials  often going insearch of them  The marvel is not that they took so long  butthat they did it so quickly Thats right 
military research and development center  As the country becamedisorganized  the Government set this project up to develop waysof improvising power and transportation and communication methodsand extracting raw materials  If theyd had a little more time they might have saved the country Fortunately  more than half the technicians at the Fort werewomen  so there was no question of them dying out  Loudons asked  
 the white-bearded man said  
The Tenant shook his head in dismay at his stupidity and Loudonsfound himself forced to say  
IV

excuse our stupidity  We know our history and we should haveidentified the word accurately --to Loudons--
there had been any law  but since there was no law  it wasobvious that they could be no crime Altamont knew without looking at his associate that Loudons wouldbe inconspicuously jotting down notes  The last was an item thesociologist would be sure to record: the white-bearded Tenant hadpronounced that reference to a written testament in capitalletters The story was continuing    the platoon there is nothing in The Books about making gunpowder  The guns inThe Books are rifles and shotguns and revolvers and airguns Except for the airguns  which we havent been able to make  theseall shot cartridges made laws for ourselves out of them And we are waiting for the Slain and Risen One 
deduce the existence of this community  if He has not done soalready Well  sir 
is the future in which you gentlemen are interested Altamont said  He knew that now he would have to be the one tostress their original mission: Loudons would probably be sofascinated by this society that the sociologist might neverremember the primary reason for coming to Pittsburgh He had no time to wonder at the interchange of glances around thetable before the Toon Leader said  The men of the Toon shook their heads  Altamont continued:exclaimed  told him   Stamford Rawson said happily

Monty  I dont know what the devil to make of this crowd 
Mexico who live in the church and claim that they have a divinemission to redeem the world by prayer  fasting  and flagellation good reason to remember them  Loudons said  
But this crowd here!
What has you stopped  Jim
Number of things  Monty  Theyre hard to explain because--
them doesnt make sense! Normally  it would take thousands of years for aslain-god religion to develop  and then only in a special situation from the field-fertility magic of primitive agriculturists heard Tenant Jones say that they mentioned firearms that usedcartridges  That means they cant be older than 1860 at theearliest Loudons picked up his cigar again  Loudons shook his head disgustedly   Altamont said  
He smoked in silence for a moment  then added  in an apologetictone  his memory--decorate his grave regularly  drink toasts to him and so on  But he hasnt been deified  They got the idea for thisgod of theirs out of the Sacred Books Altamont considered the idea  then nodded slowly  returned  paper and scribbled briefly  Altamont looked at the paper  Loudons had simply printed thefirst three letters of the word in capitals and separated eachletter with a period  of it and  especially  Ill keep my mouth shut I dont think youll be able to 
things stand now  they only suspect that you are their deity his friend religious virtue  And get this  Monty  because its somethingpractically unheard of: skepticism is a religious obligation  nota sin!

Pass the tantalus  Murray 
Gentlemen  I am baffled 
possibilities here and we dare not disregard any of them  Verner Hughes said  
took the bottle  filling it again  be eliminated  What was your third possibility  Tenantother of them is the Enemy The Enemy--with such weapons and resources!
believe that: he would have struck before this and wiped us allout!Not necessarily  Murray 
convinced that his agents  the Scowrers  could do nothingagainst us  he would bide his time  He sits motionless  like aspider  at the center of the web; he does little himself; hisagents are numerous  the Reader admitted  
And if he is the Enemy    
But if he is really He 
I think we are on trial 
that he is  but thats mere doubt  not negative certainty However  if Im wrong  if this man is truly He  we are worthy ofhim  we will penetrate his disguise A very pretty problem  gentlemen 
one for us  There is  of course  nothing we can do tonight  But tomorrow  we have promised to help our visitors  whoever they maybe  in searching for this crypt in the city have any wits at all  observe something

Listen to this infernal thing!
gold-plated spade handled with oak from an original rafter of theCongressional Library  at three-fifteen one afternoon lastweek-- One afternoon last week!couldnt that blasted magazine say what afternoon Ive gone overa lot of twentieth century copies of that magazine and thatexpression was a regular cliche with them inclusive president  complete with gold-plated spade  breaking ground  Callit Wednesday  the sixteenth  Over theres the tip of the shadowof the old Cathedral of Learning  about a hundred yards away There are so many inexactitudes  that onell probably cancel outthe other whos been dead two hundred years  but why couldnt they sayWednesday  or Monday  or Saturday  or whateverthe compass-bearing After youve landed us  go up to this altitude--use thebarometric altimeter  not the radar--and hold position Rifles pointing downward at the correct angle now
keep it at the right altitude  level and pointed in the rightdirection  and watch through the sight while you move the flagaround  and direct you by radio Simple  if I had been born quintuplets!
Mr  Altamont! Doctor Loudons!
Are you ready for us now
I have decided 
Hughes and I would be of more help than an equal number of youngmen  We may not be as active  but we do know the old ruinsbetter  especially the paths and hiding places of the Scowrers These four young men you probably met last evening  but it willdo no harm to introduce them again  Altamont said  
He showed them the old picture   he asked  
commented To his surprise  he was met with looks of incomprehension  He hadnot supposed that these people would have lost all memory ofradio communication explanation was concluded  Murray Hughes began  then stopped short  Immediately  he begantalking about the rifle that was to be used as a surveyingtransit  comparing it with the ones in the big first-floor roomat the Aitch-Cue House Locating the point where the shadow of the old Cathedral ofLearning had fallen proved easier than either Altamont or Loudonshad expected  The towering building was now a tumbled mass ofslagged rubble  but it was quite possible to determine itsoriginal center  and with the old data from the excellentreference library at Fort Ridgeway  its height above sea levelwas known  After a little jockeying  the helicopter came to ahovering stop  and the slanting barrel of the rifle in the visepointed downward along the line of the shadow that had been caston that afternoon in June  1993 The cross-hairs of the scope sight centered almost exactly on thespot Altamont had estimated on the map Guiding himself by peering through the rifle-sight  Loudonsbrought the helicopter slanting down to land on the sheet offused glass that had once been a grassy campus  Altamont said  
They began unloading equipment--a small  portablenuclear-electric conversion unit  a powerful solenoid-hammer crowbars and intrenching tools  tins of blasting plastic  Theytook out the two hunting rifles and the auto-carbines  andAltamont showed the young men of Murray Hughes detail how to usethem  the Tenant said to Altamont  
said  They waited until the helicopter had climbed to position and wascircling above  and then turned their attention to the placewhere the sheet of fused earth and stone bulged upward  It musthave been almost ground-zero of one of the hydrogen-bombs: thewreckage of the Cathedral of Learning had fallen predominantly tothe north  and the Carnegie Library was tumbled to the east Altamont said  He used the solenoid-hammer  slowly pounding a hole in the glaze and placed a small charge of the plastic explosive  Chunks of thelava-like stuff pelted down between the little mound and the hugeone of the old library  blowing a hole six feet in diameter andthe two and a half feet deep  revealing concrete bonded withcrushed steel-mill slag  Altamont said  
He used a second and larger charge  after digging a hole a footdeep  When he and his helpers came up to look  they found a largemass of concrete blown out  and solid steel behind it  Altamontcut two more holes  one on either side of the blown-out place and fired a charge in each of them  bringing down more concrete He found he hadnt missed the door after all  It had merely beenconcreted over A few more shots cleared it  and after some work  they got itopen  There was a room inside  concrete-floored and entirelyempty  Altamont stood in the doorway and inspected the interiorwith his flashlight; he heard somebody behind him say somethingabout a most peculiar sort of dark-lantern Across the small room  on the opposite wall  was a bronze plaque The plaque carried quite a lengthy inscription  including thenames of all the persons and institutions participating in themicrofilm project  The History Department at the Fort would beinterested in that  but the only thing that interested Altamontwas the statement that the floor had been laid over the trapdoorleading to the vault where the microfilms were stored  He wentoutside to the radio he said  The helicopter turned and went windmilling away  over what hadbeen the Golden Triangle  down the Ohio  Altamont went back tothe little concrete bunker and sat down  lighting his pipe Murray Hughes and his four riflemen spread out  one circlingaround the glazed butte that had been the Cathedral of Learning another climbing to the top of the old Library  and the otherstaking positions to the south and east Altamont sat in silence  smoking his pipe and trying to form someconception of the wealth under that concrete floor It was no use Jim Loudons probably understood a little more clearly what thosebooks would mean to the world of today  and what they could dotoward shaping the world of the future There was a library at Fort Ridgeway  and it was an excellent one    for its purpose  In 1996  when the rockets had come crashingdown  it had contained the cream of the worlds technicalknowledge--and very little else  There was only a little fiction a few books of ideas  just enough to give the survivors atantalizing glimpse of the world of their fathers But now           *       *       *       *       *A rifle banged to the south and east  and banged again  EitherMurray Hughes or Birdy Edwards: it was one of the two huntingrifles from the helicopter On the heels of the reports  they heard a voice shouting A moment later  there was a light whip-crack of one of themuzzleloaders  from the top of the old Carnegie Library  andAltamont could see a wisp of grey-white smoke drifting away fromwhere it had been fired Altamont jumped to his feet and raced for the radio  picking itup and bring it to the bunker Tenant Jones  old Reader Rawson  and Verner Hughes had caught uptheir rifles  The Tenant was shouting  The boy on top of the library began scrambling down  Another camerunning from the direction of the half-demolished Cathedral ofLearning  a third from the baseball field that had served asAltamonts point of reference the afternoon before The fourth  Murray Hughes  was running in from the ruins of theold Carnegie Tech buildings  and Birdy Edwards sped up the mainroad from Schenley Park  Once  twice  as he ran  Murray Hughespaused  turned  and fired behind him Then his pursuers came into sight!They ran erect  they wore a few rags of skin garments  and theycarried spears and hatchets and clubs  so they were probablyclassifiable as men  But their hair was long and unkempt  andtheir bodies were almost black with dirt and from the sun  A fewof them were yelling  but most of them ran silently  They ranmore swiftly than the boy they were pursuing: the distancebetween them narrowed every moment  There were at least fifty ofthem Verner Hughes rifle barked  one of them dropped  As cooly asthough he were shooting squirrels instead of his sons pursuers he dropped the butt of the rifle to the ground  poured a chargeof powder  patched a ball and rammed it home  replaced theramrod  Tenant Jones fired then  and Birdy Edwards joined them beginning to shoot with the telescope-sighted rifle The young man who had been north of the Cathedral of Learning hadone of the auto-carbines; luckily  Altamont had providently setthe control for semi-auto before giving it to him  He dropped toone knee and began to empty the clip  shooting slowly anddeliberately  picking off the runners who were in the lead The boy who had started to climb down off the Library halted fired his flintlock  and began reloading it Altamont  sitting down and propping his elbows on his knees  tookboth hands to the automatic which was his only weapon  emptyingthe magazine and replacing it  The last three savages he shot inthe back: they had had enough and were running for their lives So far  everybody was safe  The boy in the Library came downthrough a place where the wall had fallen  Murray Hughes stoppedrunning and came slowly toward the bunker  putting a fresh clipinto his rifle  The others came drifting in        *       *       *       *       *saying into the radio  Silence  Tenant Jones said  
radio; and as he did  he knew the answer  Loudons was in thevillage  away from the helicopter  gathering tools and workers Nothing to do but keep on trying!to know Altamont straightened  saw the second band of savages approachingabout four hundred yards away  he said  
The two auto-loading rifles began to crack  After the first fewshots  the savages took cover  Evidently they understood thecapabilities and limitations of the villagers flintlocks  butthis was a terrifying surprise to them --Altamont was almost praying into the radio--
Altamont told him A naked savage raised his head from behind what might  twohundred years ago  have been a cement park-bench and he was onlya hundred yards away  Reader Rawson promptly killed him and beganreloading  he said  
Altamont wondered what they were double-talking about  Therewasnt any particular mystery about the mass attack of the wildmen to him Debased as they were  they still possessed speech and the abilityto transmit experiences  No matter how beclouded in superstition they still remembered that aircraft dropped bombs  and bombskilled people  and where people had been killed  they would findfresh meat  They had seen the helicopter circling about  and hadheard the blasting: everyone in the area had been drawn to thescene as soon as Loudons had gone down the river But they seemed to have forgotten that aircraft carried guns although they did spring to their feet and start to run at thereturn of the helicopter However  most of them did not run far

is one report that I really want to make Of all the wonderful luck!
is the more important: finding those books  or finding thosepeople  In a few years  when we can get them supplied with modernequipment and instructed in its use-- Loudons confessed

That big hunk of cheese 
area  and by the way  it looks as though somebody thought somebodyneeded a little cooling off  but well come to that later  Heres theforecast: Today and tomorrow  the weather will continue fine; warm inthe sun  chilly in the shadows  There wont be anything to keep youfrom the polls  tomorrow  except bird-hunting  or a last chance at agame of golf  This is the first time within this commentators memorythat the weather has definitely been in favor of the party out ofpower morning  I stopped at City Hall  and found our genial Chief of PoliceDelaney  Irish Delaney to most of us  hard at work with a portabledisintegrator  getting rid of record disks and recording tapes of oldand long-settled cases  He had a couple of amusing stories  Forinstance  a lone Independent-Conservative partisan broke up aRadical-Socialist mass meeting preparatory to a march to demonstratein Double Times Square  by applying his pocket lighter to one of theheat-sensitive boxes in the building and activating the sprinklersystem  By the time the Radicals had gotten into dry clothing  therewas a  well  sort of  impromptu Conservative demonstration going on inDouble Times Square  and one of the few things the local gendarmeswont stand for is an attempt to hold two rival political meetings inthe same area mischievous amusement  Mongery went on  more seriously  Pelton snorted again  That was the Literate line  all right; treatpolitics as a joke and an election as a sporting event  let theIndependent-Conservative grafters stay in power  and let the Literatesrun the country through them  Not  of course  that he disapproved ofthose boys in the Young Radical League whod thought up thatsneeze-gas trick  Mongery continued  
handing him a big loose-leaf book  which he opened with the reverencea Literate always displayed toward the written word  They all looked at one another  thunderstruck said  Mongery  in the screen  continued  deprecatingly over his white smock and fingered the badges on hisbelt Organization who want just that  Chester Pelton knows that we cannotabolish Literacy entirely  Even with modern audio-visual recording need exists for some modicum of written recording  which can berapidly scanned and selected from--indexing  cataloguing  tabulatingdata  et cetera--and for at least a few men and women who can form andinterpret the written word  Mr  Pelton  himself  is the owner of ahuge department store  employing over a thousand Illiterates; he mustat all times have the services of at least fifty Literates And pays through the nose for them  too!
fellahin barbarism  and here I definitely part company with Mr Pelton  he fears the potential power of organized Literacy  In a word he fears a future Literate Dictatorship Future What do you think we have now
Nobody 
today  to want to be a dictator  That ended by the middle of theTwenty-first Century  Everybody knows what happened to Mussolini  andHitler  and Stalin  and all their imitators  Why  it is as much thepublic fear of Big Government as the breakdown of civil power becauseof the administrative handicap of a shortage of Literateadministrators that is responsible for the disgraceful lawlessness ofthe past hundred years  Thus  it speaks well for the public trust inChester Peltons known integrity and sincerity that so many of ourpeople are willing to agree to his program for socialized Literacy They feel that he can be trusted  and  violently as I disagree withhim  I can only say that that trust is not misplaced Mongery paused  paper  at which he glanced  Then he laughed heartily  He cocked an eye at the audience  
 He raised his hand to his audience  
 Ray said  
 Chester Pelton said  
He turned  Olaf Olafsson  the copter driver  was standing at theentrance to the breakfast nook  a smudge of oil on his cheek and hisstraw-colored hair in disorder  less surprised had the ceiling fallen in   Olaf said in disgust  as though at something obscene  
 Ray agreed  
Pelton started to his feet  Claire unlocked the table and slid it outof his way  Ray  on a run  started for the lift and vanished  he fumed  
went to the lift  and found the door closed in their faces  Claire pressed the button  Ray must have left the lift  for theoperating light went on  and in a moment the door opened  He crowdedinto the lift  along with his daughter and Olaf On the landing stage  Ray was already in the copter  poking atbuttons on the board  he called  
obediently into place--An ugly suspicion stabbed at Chester Pelton  bringing with it afeeling of frightened horror Rays eyes remained on the instrument board  He pushed another button and the propeller began swinging in a lazy circle; he pressed downwith his right foot  and the copter lifted a foot or so  he asked  
down again  The suspicion  and the horror passed in a wave of relief he asked He watched the copter rise to the two thousand foot local trafficlevel and turn in the direction of Mineola High School  fifty milesaway  He was still looking anxiously after it as it dwindled to a tinydot and vanished  Claire told him  
ashamed  at his daughter  given him when he had announced his candidacy for Senate  in thespring  Claire wrinkled her brow--just like her mother  when she was trying toremember something        *       *       *       *       *Literate First Class Ralph N  Prestonby remained standing by thelectern  looking out over the crowded auditorium  still pleasantlysurprised to estimate the days attendance at something likeninety-seven per cent of enrollment  That was really good; why  it wasonly three per cent short of perfect! Maybe it was the new rulerequiring a sound-recorded excuse for absence  Or it could have beenhis propaganda campaign about the benefits of education  Or  veryeasily  it could have been the result of sending Doug Yetsko and someof his boys around to talk to recalcitrant parents  It was good to seethat that was having some effect beside an increase in the number ofattempts on his life  or the flood of complaints to the Board ofEducation  Well  Lancedale had gotten Education merged with hisOffice of Communications  and Lancedale was back of him to the limit so the complaints had died out on the empty air  And Doug Yetsko washis bodyguard  so most of the would-be assassins had died  also The  which had replaced the 
end  The students and their white-smocked teachers  below  relaxedfrom attention; most of them sat down  while monitors and teachers inthe rear were getting the students into the aisles and marching themoff to study halls and classrooms and workshops  The orchestra struckup a lively march tune  He leaned his left elbow--Literates learnedearly  or did not live to learn  not to immobilize the right hand--onthe lectern and watched the interminable business of getting thestudents marched out  yearning  as he always did at this time  for theprivacy of his office  where he could smoke his pipe  Finally  theywere all gone  and the orchestra had gathered up its instruments andfiled out into the wings of the stage  and he looked up to the leftand said  softly:With a soft thud  the big man dropped down from the guards cubicleoverhead  grinning cheerfully  He needed a shave--Yetsko always did in the mornings--and in his leather Literates guard uniform  helooked like some ogreish giant out of the mythology of the past [Illustration:]Prestonby said  of his cubicle; he seemed surprised at Prestonbys obtuseness  Prestonby gave a snort of disgust   Yetsko said  
Prestonby nodded  Just a week before  a crude but perfectly operative17-mm shotgun had been discovered in the last stages of manufacture inthe machine shop  and five out of six of the worn-out files wouldvanish  to be ground down into dirks  He often thought of the storiesof his grandfather  who had been a major during the Occupation ofRussia  after the Fourth World War  Those old-timers didnt know howeasy theyd had it; they should have tried to run an Illiterate highschool Yetsko was still grumbling slanders on the legitimacy of the studentbody   he falsettoed incongruously  
Education and the tax-paying public that was probably subversivewithin the meaning of the Loyalty Oath  last week  a dozen pupils had been seriously cut or blackjacked inhall and locker-room fights   Yetsko comforted him  
       *       *       *       *       *Prestonby took the thick-barreled gas pistol from the shelf under thelectern and shoved it into his hip pocket; Yetsko picked up atwo-and-a-half foot length of rubber hose and tucked it under his leftarm  Together  they went back through the wings and out into thehallway that led to the office  So a Twenty-second Century high schoolwas a place where a teacher carried a pistol and a tear-gas projectorand a sleep-gas gun  and had a bodyguard  and still walked in dangerof his life from armed teen-age hooligans  It was meaningless to askwhose fault it was  There had been the World Wars  and the cold-warinterbellum periods--rising birth rates  huge demands on the publictreasury for armaments  with the public taxed to the saturation point and no money left for the schools  There had been fantasticTwentieth Century  in the big cities  children were being pushedthrough grade school without having learned to read  And when therehad been money available for education  school boards had insisted onspending it for audio-visual equipment  recordings  films  anythingbut textbooks  And there had been that lunatic theory that childrenshould be taught to read by recognizing whole words instead oflearning the alphabet  And more and more illiterates had been shovedout of the schools  into a world where radio and television and movingpictures were supplanting books and newspapers  and more and morechildren of illiterates had gone to school without any desire orincentive to learn to read  And finally  the illiterates had becomeIlliterates  and literacy had become Literacy And now  the Associated Fraternities of Literates had come tomonopolize the ability to read and write  and a few men like WilliamR  Lancedale  with a handful of followers like Ralph N  Prestonby were trying--The gleaming cleanliness of the corridor  as always  heartenedPrestonby a little; it was a trophy of victory from his first two daysat Mineola High School  three years ago  He remembered what they hadlooked like when he had first seen them The janitors  all political appointees  Independent-Conservativeparty-hacks  secure in their jobs  had laughed derisively  Thebuilding superintendent  without troubling to rise  had answered him:said  The fellows name  he recalled  was Kettner; Lancedale had given hima briefing which had included some particulars about him  He was anIndependent-Conservative ward-committeeman  He had gotten his presentjob after being fired from his former position as mailman forlistening to other peoples mail with his pocket recorder-reproducer  he had said

       *       *       *       *       *Frank Cardon stood on the sidewalk  looking approvingly into the windowof OReillys Tavern  in which his display crew had already set up thespread for the current week  On either side was a giant six-footreplica  in black glass  of the Cardon bottle  in the conventional shapeaccepted by an Illiterate public as containing beer  bearing the redCardon label with its pictured bottle in a central white disk  Becauseof the heroic size of the bottles  the pictured bottle on the label borea bottle bearing a label bearing a bottle bearing a bottle on alabel     He counted eight pictured bottles  down to the tiniest dot ofblack  There were four-foot bottles next to the six-foot bottles  andthree-foot bottles next to them  and  in the middle background  alife-size tri-dimensional picture of an almost nude and incrediblypulchritudinous young lady smiling in invitation at the passing throngand extending a foaming bottle of Cardons in her hand  Aside from theprinted trademark-registry statements on the labels  there was not aprinted word visible in the window He pushed through the swinging doors and looked down the long room with the chairs still roosting sleepily on the tables  and made aquick count of the early drinkers  two thirds of them in white smocksand Sam Browne belts  obviously from Literates Hall  across thestreet  Late drinkers  he corrected himself mentally; theyd be thenight shift  having their drinks before going home  the bartender greeted him  
 Cardon told him  
folded a C-bill accordion-wise and set it on edge on the bar  announced  then lowered his voice  building across the street of him  accepted the thanks of the house  and  when the bartenderbrought the fifteen-dollars-odd change from the dozen drinks  hepushed it back He drank slowly  looking around the room  then set down his emptyglass and went back  past two doors which bore pictured half-doorsrevealing  respectively  masculine-trousered and feminine-stockingedankles  and opened the unmarked office door beyond  The bartender  heknew  had pushed the signal button; the door was unlocked  and inside  OReilly--baptismal name Luigi Orelli--was waiting The brewer nodded  inside The corner cupboard  which was an elevator  took him to a tunnel belowthe street  Across the street  he entered another elevator  set theindicator for the tenth floor  and ascended  As the car rose  he couldfeel the personality of Frank Cardon  Illiterate brewer  drop fromhim  as though he were an actor returning from the stage to hisdressing room The room into which he emerged was almost that  There was a longtable  at which two white-smocked Literates drank coffee and went oversome papers; a third Literate sprawled in a deep chair  resting; at asmall table  four men in black shirts and leather breeches and fieldboots played poker  while a fifth  who had just entered and had notyet removed his leather helmet and jacket or his weapons belt  stoodwatching them Cardon went to a row of lockers along the wall  opened one  and tookout a white smock  pulling it over his head and zipping it up to thethroat  Then he buckled on a Sam Browne with its tablet holster andstylus gas projector  The Literate sprawling in the chair opened oneeye  Cardon replied  
He passed through the door across from the elevator  went down a shorthall  and spoke in greeting to the leather-jacketed storm trooper onguard outside the door at the other end  the guard nodded  
He opened the door and went through  William R  Lancedale rose frombehind his desk and advanced to greet him with a quick handshake guiding him to a chair beside the desk  As he did  he sniffed andraised an eyebrow  Cardon replied  
Literate executive resumed his seat  passing a hand back and forthslowly across the face of the commo  the diamond on his fingertwinkling  and gave brief instructions  They were both silent as a novice Literate bustled in with coffee andindividually-sealed cigars  Cardon said  
Lancedales thin face broke into a smile  little wrinkles putting hismouth in parentheses  Cardon sampled the coffee  and then used aSixteenth Century Italian stiletto from Lancedales desk to perforatethe end of his cigar said  Lancedale nodded  Lancedale consigned the brewery to perdition   Cardon said  
 Lancedale said  
Cardon shook his head  Lancedale handed over a little half-inch thirty-minute  record disk  he said  
Cardon put the disk in his pocket recorder and set it for play-back putting the plug in his ear  After a while  he shut it off and tookout the ear plug Lancedale shrugged   he countered  
Cardon thought for a moment   he decided  
 Lancedale agreed  
Lancedale nodded  the stiletto  which he still held  Cardon said   Lancedale added  
grimaced   Lancedale said  
He walked with OReilly to the street door  talking about tomorrowselection; after shaking hands with the saloon keeper  he crossed thesidewalk and stepped onto the beltway  moving across the strips untilhe came to the twenty m p h  strip  The tall office buildings of upperYonkers Borough marched away as he stood on the strip  appreciativelypuffing at Lancedales cigar  The character of the street changed; thebuildings grew lower  and the quiet and fashionable ground-floor shopsand cafés gave place to bargain stores  their audio-advertiserswhooping urgently about improbable prices and offerings  and garish noisy  crowded bars and cafeterias blaring recorded popular music There was quite a bit of political advertising in evidence--hugepictures of the two major senatorial candidates  He estimated thatChester Peltons bald head and bulldog features appeared twice forevery one of Grant Hamiltons white locks  old-fashioned spectaclesand self-satisfied smirk Then he came to the building on which he had parked his copter  andleft the beltway  entering and riding up to the landing stage on thehelical escalator  There seemed to have been some trouble; about adozen Independent-Conservative storm troopers  in their white robesand hoods  with the fiery-cross emblem on their breasts  were bunchedtogether  most of them with their right hands inside their bosoms while a similar group of Radical-Conservative storm troopers  withtheir black sombreros and little black masks  stood watching them andfingering the white-handled pistols they wore in pairs on their belts Between the two groups were four city policemen  looking acutelyunhappy The group in the Lone Ranger uniforms  he saw  were standing in frontof a huge tri-dimensional animated portrait of Chester Pelton  As hewatched  the pictured candidate raised a clenched fist  and Peltonsrecorded and amplified voice thundered:He recognized the group leader of the Radical-Socialists--the maskswere too small to be more than token disguises--and beckoned to him at the same time walking toward his copter  The man in black with thewhite-handled pistols followed him  spurs jingling  he said  joining him

 Goodkin replied  
Cardon nodded  He climbed into his own copter and started the motor roared triumphantly after the retreating Independents         *       *       *       *       *At eight thousand  he got the copter onto the lower Manhattan beamand relaxed  First of all  hed have to do something about answeringSlade Gardners telecast propaganda  That stuff was dangerous  Theanswer ought to go on the air by noon  and should be stepped upthrough the afternoon  First as a straight news story;

with him were his assistant  Literate Third Class Roger B Feinberg  and the novices carrying books and briefcases and casedtypewriters  and the guards  and every Literate employed in the store Four or five men in ordinarily vivid-colored business suits wereobviously expostulating about something  As he landed and threw back thetransparent canopy  he could hear a babel of voices  above whichFeinberg was crying: He jumped out and hurried over        *       *       *       *       *clothes was protesting  Bayne  his thin face livid with anger--and also  Cardon noticed  withwhat looked like a couple of fresh bruises--ignored him  Feinbergbroke off his chant of Cardon grabbed the blue-and-orange clad man and dragged him to oneside Cardon felt his face tighten into a frown of perplexity  That wasntlike Literate First Class Stephen S  Bayne  He made quite a hobby ofpinching salesgirls behind the counter which was one thing; the bossdaughter was quite another Cardon swore and ran for the descending escalator  running down therotating spiral to the executive floor and jumping off into thegawking mob of Illiterate clerks crowded in the open doors of Peltonsoffice  He hit and shoved and elbowed and cursed them out of the way and burst into the big room beyond  and then  for a moment  he wasalmost sorry he had come Pelton was slumped in his big relaxer chair  his face pale and twistedin pain  his breath coming in feeble gasps  His daughter was besidehim  her blond head bent over him; Russell Latterman was standing toone side  watching intently  For an instant  Cardon was reminded of atomcat watching a promising mouse hole  Cardon exploded  
Claire turned  desperate eyes  He shot a quick glance at Latterman  catching the sales manager beforehe could erase a look of triumph from his face  Things began to addup  Latterman  of course  was the undercover man for Wilton Joyner andHarvey Graves and the rest of the Conservative faction at LiteratesHall  just as he  himself  was Lancedales agent  Obsessed withimmediate advantages and disadvantages  the Joyner-Graves factionwanted to secure the re-election of Grant Hamilton  and the way thingshad been going in the past two months  only Chester Peltons deathcould accomplish that  Latterman had probably thrown out Peltonsnitrocaine capsules and then put Bayne up to insulting Peltonsdaughter  knowing that a fit of rage would bring on another heartattack  which could be fatal without the medicine The office safe was locked  and only a Literate could open it  Thedouble combination was neatly stenciled on the door  the numbersspelled out as words and the letters spelled in phonetic equivalents All three of them--himself  Claire  and Russell Latterman--could readthem  None of them dared admit it  Latterman was fairly licking hischops in anticipation  If Cardon opened the safe  Peltons campaignmanager stood convicted as a Literate  If Claire opened it  the gaggleof Illiterate clerks in the doorway would see  and speedily spreadthe news  that the daughter of the arch-foe of Literacy was herselfable to read  Maybe Latterman hadnt really intended his employer todie  Maybe this was the situation he had really intended to contrive Chester Pelton couldnt be allowed to die  If Grant Hamilton werereturned to the Senate  the long-range planning of William Lancedalewould suffer a crushing setback  and the public reaction would becatastrophic  The Plan comes first  Lancedale had told him  He madehis decision  and then saw that he hadnt needed to make it  Clairehad straightened  left her father  crossed quickly to the safe  andwas kneeling in front of it  her back stiff with determination  herfingers busy at the dials  her eyes going from them to the printedcombination and back again  She swung open the door  skimmed throughthe papers inside  unerringly selected the prescription  and rose  she ordered  
Oh  no  you dont  Cardon thought  One chance is enough for you  Russ He snatched the prescription from her and turned to Latterman  he told the sales manager  
Cardon blazed: pistol that had been taken from Pelton when he had tried to draw it onBayne  checking the chamber and setting the safety   he asked Claire  
He gave her no chance to argue  Pushing Latterman ahead of him  hedrove through the mob of clerks outside the door  
A couple of centuries ago  they would have talked like that if it hadbeen discovered that the girl were pregnant; a couple of centuriesbefore that  they would have been equally horrified if she had beendiscovered to have been a Protestant  or a Catholic  or whatever thelocally unpopular religion happened to be  By noon  this would be allover Penn-Jersey-York; coming on top of Slade Gardners accusations--       *       *       *       *       *He ran up the spiral escalator  stumbling and regaining his footing ashe left it  Bayne and his striking Literates were all gone; he saw asergeant of Peltons store police and went toward him  taking hisspare identity-badge from his pocket  he said  handing it to the sergeant  
He jumped into his copter  pulled forward the plexiglass canopy  andtook off vertically to ten thousand feet  then  orienting himself swooped downward toward a landing stage on the other side of the EastRiver  cutting across traffic levels with an utter contempt forregulations The building on which he landed was one of the principal pharmacies;he spiraled down on the escalator to the main floor and went directlyto the Literate in charge  noticing that he wore on his Sam Browne notonly the badges of retail-merchandising  pharmacist and graduatechemist but also that of medic-in-training  Snatching a pad and pencilfrom a counter  he wrote hastily: Your private office  at once;urgent and important Looking at it  the Literate nodded in recognition of CardonsLiteracy office  Cardon gave him the prescription  
glancing at it  black Mexican jacket--Cardon had his pocket recorder in his hand  He held it out  pressing aconcealed stud; the stylus-and-tablet insignia glowed redly on it fora moment  then vanished  The uniformed Literate nodded Literate  who had not recognized him before  opened his eyes at thename and whistled softly  The man in the Literate smock nodded and hurried out  Cardon dialedWilliam R  Lancedales private number  When Lancedales thin  intenseface appeared on the screen  he reported swiftly  he finished  
Cardon laughed with mirthless harshness  went with a pause for semantic re-integration   He considered for a moment  
Breaking the connection  Cardon dialed again  A girls face  over aLiterate Third Class smock  appeared in the screen; a lovely goldenvoice chimed at him:       *       *       *       *       *Ralph Prestonby cleared his throat  slipped a master disk into therecording machine beside his desk  and pressed the start button  he began

Isnt that enough
the store  after a while  Bye Whats happened
my father     had another heart attack store  resting in his office Frame-up 
put-up job  Somethings going to happen to Russ Latterman  one ofthese days I think youd better let Frank Cardon take care of him  Ray

with Ray till I get back  Dont let him out of your sight for aninstant  At noon  have Miss Collins get lunches for both of you sentup; if Im not back by fifteen-hundred  take him to his home  and staywith him there Hold it!
when it happened  and saw everything of you! Our boss  and--if he lives--our next senator  was the victim ofa deliberate murder attempt  by Literate First Class Bayne  who threw outhis supply of nitrocaine bulbs and then goaded him into a heart attackwhich  except for his daughter  would have been fatal  Claire Peltondeserves the deepest gratitude of every Radical-Socialist in the state Shes a smart girl  and she saved the life of her father and our leader  he cried loudly  
Looking around  he caught sight of a pair who seemed something lessthan impressed with his account of it  Joe West  thick-armed hairy-chested  blue-jowled; Horace Yingling  thin and gangling  Theywerent Radical-Socialist party people; they were from the PoliticalAction Committee of the Consolidated Illiterates Organization  andtheir slogan was simpler and more to the point than ChesterPeltons--the only good Literate is a dead Literate  He tensed himselfand challenged them directly Yingling looked at West  and West looked back at him questioningly Evidently the suavitor in modo was Yinglings province  and thefortior in re was Wests  Yingling said dubiously  
       *       *       *       *       *It was worse than that in some of the other boroughs  One fanatic imagining that Cardon himself was a crypto-Literate  drew a gun Cardons guards disarmed him and beat him senseless  At anotherheadquarters  some character was circulating about declaring that notonly Claire Pelton but her younger brother  Ray  as well  wereLiterates  Cardons two men hustled him out of the building  and after about twenty minutes  returned alone  Cardon hoped that the bodywould not be found until after the polls closed  the next day Finally  leaving his guards with the copter at a public landingstage  he made his way  by devious routes  to William R  Lancedalesoffice  and found Lancedale at his desk  seeming not to have movedsince he had showed his agent out earlier in the day him   Lancedale told him  
 Lancedale smiled  
The buzzer on Lancedales desk interrupted  and a voice came out ofthe commo box:Cardon recognized the name  Maybe the Independent-Conservatives havetroubles  too  he thought hopefully  Then Lancedales video screenbecame the frame for an almost unbelievably commonplace set offeatures  the man in the screen said  
directed  nodded and vanished from the screen considered  photoelectric eye of the commo box  and  a little later  intelligence report and the conclusions drawn from it  The guardsofficer repeated back his instructions  and Lancedale broke theconnection  he said  
       *       *       *       *       *A couple of men in the maroon uniform of Peltons store police werewaiting as Prestonbys copter landed on the top stage; one of themtouched his cap-visor with his gas-billy in salute and said: He had hoped to find her alone  but when he entered the office  he sawfive or six of the store personnel with her  Since opening herfathers safe  she had evidently dropped all pretense of Illiteracy;there was a mass of papers spread on the big desk  and she wasreferring from one to another of them with the deft skill of a regularFraternities Literate  while the others watched in fascinated horror the blue and orange business suit with whom she had been talking  andlaid the printed price-schedule down  advancing to meet him  she greeted him  
For a moment  he thought of the afternoon  over two years ago  whenshe had entered his office at the school  and he had recognized her asthe older sister of young Ray Pelton  she had begun  accusingly  
He had been prepared for that; had known that sooner or later therewould be some minor leak in the security screen around the classroomson the top floor  he had protested pleasantly  
 he had parried  
 she had replied coolly  
Now  with this gang of her fathers Illiterate store officialspresent  a quick handclasp and a glance were all they could exchange She led him to a door at the rear of the office and motioned him toenter  following him  The room was a sort of bedroom and dressing room  with a minisculetoilet and shower beyond  Pelton was lying on his back  sleeping; hisface was pale  but he was breathing easily and regularly  Two of thestore policemen  a sergeant and a patrolman  were playing cards on thelittle table  and the patrolman had a burp gun within reach  Claire said  
The sergeant started to protest  Claire cut him off The two rose and went out  leaving the door barely ajar  Prestonby andClaire  like a pair of marionettes on the same set of strings  cast aquick glance at the door and then were in each others arms  ChesterPelton slept placidly as they kissed and whispered endearments It was Claire who terminated the embrace  looking apprehensively ather slumbering father  she asked  
Prestonby thought furiously  trying to find a safe path through thetangle of Claire Peltons conflicting loyalties  trying to find a pathbetween his own loyalties and his love for her  wondering how much itwould be safe to tell her Her eyes widened   she said  
Somebody rapped on the door  called  Prestonby smiled   he said  
She followed him as he went out into Peltons office  When he snappedon the screen  a young man in a white smock  with the FraternitiesExecutive Section badge  looked out of it  He gave a slight start whenhe saw Prestonby screen replied  Armandez announced Prestonby asked The man in the screen consulted his watch  and their implications  The Literate in the screen blinked; that was the equivalent  for him of anybody elses jaw dropping to his midriff        *       *       *       *       *catch her attention  reminded her  The man--Hutschnecker  Prestonby remembered hearing Claire callhim--nodded A buzzer drew one of the Illiterates to a handphone  He listened for amoment  and turned Claire handed Prestonby a black-bound book  Another buzzer rasped  before Prestonby could find the entry onZydanowycz  H  Armytage; the Illiterate office worker  laying down onephone  grabbed up another  Hutschnecker said  
asked   Claire said  
across the desk to him         *       *       *       *       *It went on  like that  for the next hour  When the new Literate crewarrived  Prestonby was delighted to find a friend  and afellow-follower of Lancedale  in charge  Considering that RetailMerchandising was Wilton Joyners section  that was a good omen Lancedale must have succeeded to an extraordinary degree in imposinghis will on the Grand Council  Prestonby found  however  that hewould need some time to brief the new chief Literate on theoperational details at the store  He was unwilling to bring Claire tooprominently into the conference  although he realized that it would bea matter of half an hour  at the outside  before every one of the newLiterate crew would have heard about her Literate ability  If shedonly played dumb  after opening that safe--Finally  by 1300  the new Literates had taken over  and the sale wasrunning smoothly again  Latterman was somewhere out in the store helping them; Claire had lunch for herself and Prestonby sent up fromthe restaurant  and for a while they ate in silence  broken byoccasional spatters of small-talk  Then she returned to the questionshe had raised and he had not yet answered  she asked  
He shook his head  He paused  thinking quickly  If Lancedale had gotten the upper hand there was likely to be a revision of the Joyner-Graves attitude towardPelton  In that case  the less he said to incriminate RussellLatterman  the better  Let Bayne be the villain  for a while  hedecided  he continued  
William R  Lancedale  Im of his faction  and so is Frank Cardon  Wewant to see your father elected  because the socialization of Literacywould eventually put the Literates in complete control of thegovernment  We also want to see Literacy become widespread  eventuallyuniversal  just as it was before World War IV But Wouldnt that mean the end of the Fraternities
it did Lancedale says  if were so incompetent that we have to keepthe rest of the world in ignorance to earn a living  the worldsbetter off without us  He says that every oligarchy carries in it theseeds of its own destruction; that if we cant evolve with the rest ofthe world  were doomed in any case  Thats why we want to elect yourfather  If he can get his socialized Literacy program adopted  wellbe in a position to load the public with so many controls andrestrictions and formalities that even the most bigoted Illiteratewill want to learn to read  Lancedale says  a private monopoly likeours is bad  but a government monopoly is intolerable  and the onlyway the public can get rid of it would be by becoming Literates themselves Poor Senator!
children are Literates  and his program against Literacy is beingtwisted against itself!But you agree that were right and hes wrong
must  or youd never have come to me to learn to read Hes such a good father  Id hate to see him hurt

most serious problem  which I and some of my colleagues have broughtto the attention of this Council many times in the past--the problemof Black Literacy!anything could destroy our Fraternities  to which we have given ourlives devotion  it would be the widespread tendency to by-pass theFraternities  the practice of Literacy by non-Fraternities people--Weve heard all that before  Wilton!
gotten on every record of every meeting for the last thirty yearsWhy  this Pelton business 
what I mean  Your own associates are responsible for it!And thats not all  brother Literates 
Pelton has been openly doing the work of a Literate; going over thestores written records  checking inventories  checking the creditguide  handling the price lists--Whats that got to do with Black Literacy
practice of Literacy  for hire  by a non-Fraternity Literate  orLiterate service furnished for criminal or politically subversivepurposes  or the betrayal of a client by a Fraternity Literate Theres nothing of the sort involved here  This girl  who does appearto be Literate  is simply looking after the interests of her familysbusiness the very least  irregular circumstances  and without payment of anyfee  Any fee  that is  that the Fraternities can collect anypercentage on  And the Literate who taught her also taught her youngerbrother  Ray Pelton  and this Literate  who is known to be herlover--Suppose he is her lover  so what
remove any objection  Why  if she were to come forward and admit anddemonstrate her Literacy  thered be no possible objection from theFraternities viewpoint to her marrying young Prestonby brother commendation of the Fraternities  Hes put a period to fourgenerations of bigoted Illiterates motionLiterates: I yield to no man in my abhorrence of Black Literacy  or inmy detestation for the political principles of which Chester Peltonhas made himself the spokesman  but I deny that we should allow theacts and opinions of the Illiterate parent to sway us in ourconsideration of the Literate children  It has come to my notice  asit has to Literate Graves  that this young woman  Claire Pelton  isLiterate to a degree that would be a credit to any Literate FirstClass  and her brother can match his Literacy creditably against thatof any novice in our Fraternities  To show that we respect Literateability  wherever we find it; to show that we are not the monopolisticclosed-corporation our enemies accuse us of being; to show that we arenot animated by a vindictive hatred of anything bearing the name ofPelton--I move  and ask that my motion be presented for seconding that Claire Pelton  and her brother  Raymond Pelton  be duly elected respectively  to the positions of Literate Third Class and LiterateNovice  as members of the Associated Fraternities of Literates!Admit the young Peltons!Literate President!

plenty of A-A equipment up there--four 7-mm machine guns  two 12-mms and one 20-mm auto-cannon  We could hold off the State Guard withthat the escalators  Think  now  sergeant  Fires  burglary  holdups--of each escalator  and a couple more that can be dragged over fromother outlets  Say we put two men on each hose  lying down at the headof the escalators  And we got plenty of firearms; we can arm some ofthese clerks  up here--inter-department telephone  not by public address  to floorwalkersfrom the fifth floor down  to gather up all male clerks and otherstore personnel in their departments  arm them with anything they canfind  and rush them to Chinaware  Tell them to shout Pelton! whenthey hit the mob  to avoid breaking each others heads in theconfusion  and tell them theyre expected to hold the Chinaware andGlassware departments themselves  without any help from the storepolice Why not
Thats how battles come to happen at the wrong time and place 
back for re-enforcements  and the next thing anybody knows  theres afull-size battle going on where nobody wants to fight one  Were goingto fight our main battle at the head of the escalators from thetwelfth floor Youve done this sort of work before  Literate

Thatll be two C  sir 
I see youre wearing a Radical-Socialist button 
Because you want to  or because Chet Pelton makes you
convictions Thats all that rotguts good for 
All right  boys; help yourselves!
I ought to have anticipated that 
the liquor stores are the first things looted  The liquor stores  andthe--Claire! See whats going on in Sporting Goods!Macy & Gimbels 
trouble--probably one of their price-spotters phoned in about it--andtheyre offering to send twenty of their store-cops to help us out Theyll be landing on our stage in eight minutes  rifles and steelhelmets That you  Prestonby
Didnt know you were at Peltons  Whats going on  there
Yes; we had some of our people at the store  in plain clothes 
reported a riot starting  but naturally  their reports wereincomplete  Can you get one of your landing stages cleared for us Wehave two hundred men  in twenty copters protect our own people at the store Yes  of course 
Youll probably find a fight going on on our twelfth floor  justinside  Anybody whos trying to get up the escalators to the officeblock will be an enemy Right  Were halfway there now 
You heard that
we can hold out till they get here  were all right  Did you contactRadical-Socialist headquarters  yet  Hutschneckerstorm troops had been lured out to some kind of a disturbance in NorthJersey Borough; hed try to get them recalled the Literates Guards and Macy & Gimbels will have pulled Peltonsbacon off the fire for him  Nice friends he has!Here come the goons! South escalator!

Broadway Wife 
steadily worse  We take you now to downtown Manhattan  where ourportable units and commentators have just arrived  and switch you toEd Morgan give you the picture  Were having what is usually labeled as slighttechnical difficulties  in this case the difficulty of avoidinghaving a hole shot in our camera or in your commentators head  Yes thats shooting you hear; there  somebodys using an auto rifle! Howare you coming  Stevewhats sure to go down in history as the Battle of PeltonsPurchasers Paradise--Huh
brawl  and spread to the Liquor Department  and then  all of a sudden everybody started playing rough  At first  it was suspected that Macy& Gimbels had sent a goon gang around to break up Peltons fall sale but when the former concern rallied to the assistance of theircompetitor with a force of twenty riflemen  that began to look lesslikely  and were beginning to think that it might be the work of someof Peltons political enemies  About ten minutes ago  Major James F Slater  of the Literates Guards  arrived with two hundred of his men to protect the Literates on duty at the store  They captured theentire twelfth floor  where we are  now  with the exception of theLadies Lingerie and Hosiery departments around one of the escalatorsto the lower floors; here the gang who started the riot  and who arenow donning white hoods to distinguish themselves from the variousother factions involved  have thrown up barricades of counters anddisplay tables and are fighting bitterly to keep control of theescalator head  Ah  here we are!on the east stage  filled with more goons  probably to re-enforce thegang back of that barricade  The firings gotten noticeably heavier--Whats the matter  Doug
going you Doug  didnt Captain Prestonby tell you to stay with me
Yes--
senator  Thats who that goon gangs after No  You gotta stay here  Ray 
The captain--

Come on  Ray; lets go!
Hirschfield; Jerry McCarty; Ramon Nogales; Pete Shawne; TomHutchinson--Who--
Whatve they gotta do with--
at a Dutch picnic them called for and sent in here can find us some transport  I think there ought to be a couple of bigcopters finished down at the shops  And if you can find a couple moreLiterates guards you can talk into going with us--That thing been tested  yet

murderous battle like that--Well  maybe it aint right  using savages in a civilized riot 
use live devils  if I could catch a few Here; you kids dont want this kinda stuff 
killing tools!Its what well have to use  Doug 
happening  since you went out  Look at the screen when theres no clip in  or when the clips empty  When you got aloaded clip in  you just pull back on this and let go--Literates see  by now  that the policy of unyielding opposition which some ofyou have advocated and pursued is futile  You know the policy I favor which now remains the only policy we can follow; it is summed up inthat law of political strategy: If you cant lick em  join em  and after joining  take control that  if we do not destroy ourselves by our own folly in the meantime we should  two years thereafter  be in complete if secret control ofthe whole Consolidated States Government  If any of you question thatlast statement  you can merely ask yourselves one question: How  inthe name of all that is rational  can Illiterates control and operatea system of socialized Literacy Who but Literates can keep such aprogram from disintegrating into complete and indescribable confusionlooked around the room  Instantly  Cardon was on his feet with a motion to recess the meetinguntil 1300 the following Monday  and Brigade commander Chernovseconded the motion immediately  As soon as Literate PresidentMoreheads gavel banged  Cardon  still on his feet  was running forthe double doors at the rear; the two Literates guards on duty theregot them unsealed and opened by the time he had reached them There was another guard in the hall  waiting for him with a littlerecord-disk Cardon snapped the disk into his recorder-reproducer and put in theear plug  Slaters voice came out of the small machine  
Cardon pulled out the ear plug  stuffed the recorder into his trouserpocket  and began unbuckling his Sam Browne as he ran for the nearestwall visiphone  He was dialing the guard room on that floor with onehand as he took off the belt  he ordered  unbuttoning his smock  
at the guard  the last word back over his shoulder as he ran for the escalator [Illustration:]It was three eternal minutes after he had reached the landing stageabove before the ambulance arrived  medic and orderly on the frontseat and the four guards  all in conservatively cut civilian clothes inside  He crowded in beside the medic  told him  and snapped the door shut as the big white copter began to rise They climbed to five thousand feet  and then the driver nosed hisvehicle up  cut his propeller and retracted it  and fired his rocket aiming toward downtown Manhattan  Four minutes later  after the rocketstopped firing and they were on the down-curve of their trajectory the propeller was erected and they began letting down toward thecentral landing stage of Peltons Purchasers Paradise  Cardon cut inthe TV and began calling the control tower  he called  
One of Peltons traffic-control men appeared on Cardons screen  he said  
The ambulance came slanting in from uptown  and Cardon looked aroundanxiously  The May-fly dance of customers copters had stopped; therewas a Sabbath stillness about the big store  at least visually  A fewsmall figures in Literates guards black leather moved about on thenorth landing stage  and several Pelton employees were on the centralstop stage  The howling of the copter propeller overhead effectivelyblocked out any sounds that might be coming from the building  atleast until the ambulance landed  Then a spatter of firing from belowwas audible Cardon  the medic and the guards piled out  the latter with thestretcher  The orderly-driver got out his tablet pistol and checkedthe chamber  then settled into a posture of watchful relaxation  MajorSlater was waiting for them by one of the vertical lift platforms Cardon hushed him quickly  warned   Slater said  
That was good  Ralph would help get Claire to Literates Hall  aftertheyd gotten her father to safety  Slater was saying  
 Cardon said  
where they found Claire Pelton and Ralph Prestonby waiting   Prestonby said  
 Cardon commented gently  
Horace Yingling and Joe West; this time tomorrow  theyll be a pair ofdead traitors  he thought  Prestonby gave a sidewise glance toward Claire and shook his head  hislips pressed tightly together  She doesnt know  yet  Cardoninterpreted  Prestonby said  aloud  
Cardon nodded  Probably vindictive about being involved in actioninjurious to Peltons commercial interests; just another odd quirk ofLiterate ethics  he said  
to the medic and the four plain-clothes guards  The medic and the guards moved into Chester Peltons private rest roomwith the stretcher  Claire went to the desk and began picking up oddsand ends  including the pistol Cardon had given her  and putting themin her handbag he told Prestonby softly  Prestonby grabbed his hand impulsively  There was a sudden blast of sound from overhead--the banging ofmachine guns  the bark of the stores 20-mm auto-cannon  the howlingof airplane jets  and the crash of explosions  Everybody in the roomjerked up and stood frozen  then Prestonby jumped for the TV-screenand pawed at the dials  A moment later  after the screen flashed andwent black twice  they were looking across the topside landing stagefrom a pickup at one corner A slim fighter-bomber  with square-tipped  backswept  wings  wasjetting up in almost perpendicular flight; another was coming intoward the landing stage  and  as they watched  a flight of rocketsleaped forward from under its wings  Cardon saw the orderly-driver ofthe ambulance jump down and start to run for the open lift-shaft  Hegot five steps away from his vehicle  Then the rockets came in  andone of them struck the tarpaulin-covered pile of boxes beside theambulance  There was a flash of multicolored flame  in which the manand the vehicle he had left both vanished  Immediately  the screenwent black The fireworks had mostly exploded at the first blast; however  whenCardon and Major Slater and one or two others reached the top landingstage  there were still explosions  A thing the size and shape of atwo-gallon kettle  covered with red paper  came rolling toward them and suddenly let go with a blue-green flash  throwing a column ofsmoke  in miniature imitation of an A-bomb  into the air  Somethingabout three feet long came whizzing at them on the end of a tail offire  causing them to fling themselves flat; involuntarily  Cardonshead jerked about and his eyes followed it until it blew up with aflash and a bang three blocks uptown  Here and there  colored fireflared  small rockets flew about  and firecrackers popped The ambulance was gone  blown clear off the roof  The other copterson the landing stage were a tangled mass of wreckage  The 20-mm wastoppled over; the gunner was dead  and one of the crew  half-dazed was trying to drag a third man from under the overturned gun  Thecontrol tower  with the two 12-mm machine guns  was wrecked  The two7-mms that had been left on the top had vanished  along with themachine gunners  in a hole that had been blown in the landing stage Cardon  Slater  and the others dashed forward and pulled theauto-cannon off the injured man  hauling him and his companion over tothe lift  The two rakish-winged fighter-bombers were returning spraying the roof with machine-gun bullets  and behind them came aprocession of fifteen big copters  They dropped the lift hastily;Slater jumped off when it was still six feet above the floor  andbegan shouting orders Cardon caught up a rifle and rummaged for a bandolier of ammunition losing about a minute in the search  The delay was fortunate; when hegot to the escalators  he was met by a rush of men hurrying down theascending spiral or jumping over onto the descending one  one of them was shouting  
He turned and looked toward the freight lift  It was coming down again with Falk and his men unconscious on it  knocked senseless by bludgeonsof inaudible sound  and a half a dozen of the copter-borne raiders  allwearing the white robes and hoods of the Independent-Conservative stormtroops  He swung his rifle up and began squeezing the trigger remembering to first make sure that the fire-control lever was setforward for semiauto  and remembering his advice to Goodkin  thatmorning  By the time the platform had stopped  all the men in whiterobes were either dead or wounded  and none of the unconsciousLiterates guards along with them had been injured  The medic who hadcome with Cardon  assisted by a couple of the office force  got thecasualties sorted out  There was nothing that could be done about themen who had been sono-stunned; in half an hour or so  they would recoverconsciousness with no ill effects that a couple of headache tabletswouldnt set right The situation  while bad  was not immediately desperate  If thewhite-clad raiders controlled the top landing stage  they were pinneddown by the firearms and sono guns of the defenders  below  who werein a position to stop anything that came down the escalators or thelift shaft  The fate of the first party was proof of that  And thevery magnitude of the riot guaranteed that somebody on the outside city police  State guards  or even Consolidated States regulars  wouldbe taking a hand shortly  The air attack and copter-landing on theroof had been excellent tactics  but it had been a seriouspolicy-blunder  As long as the disturbance had been confined to theinterior of the store  the city police could shrug it off as anotherminor riot on property supposed to be protected by private police  anddo nothing about it  The rocket-attack on the top landing stage andthe spectacular explosion of the fireworks temporarily stored there however  was something that simply couldnt be concealed or dismissed The cloud of varicolored smoke alone must have been visible all overthe five original boroughs of the older New York  and there wereprobably rumors of atom-bombing going around thing  said to Cardon   Cardon told him  
 He snapped his fingers suddenly  
There were two dead men in white Independent-Conservative robes andhoods  lying where they had been dragged from the lift platform Cardon pulled off the hoods and zipped open the white robes  One ofthe men was a complete stranger; the other  however  was a man he hadseen  earlier in the day  at the Manhattan headquarters of theRadical-Socialist Party  One of the Consolidated IlliteratesOrganization people; a follower of West and Yingling  he said  straightening  
       *       *       *       *       *Ray Pelton and Doug Yetsko had their heads out an open window on theright side of the cab of the copter truck; Ray was pointing down  he said  
Yetsko nodded  Thered be a watchman  or a private cop  in thebuilding on which Ray intended landing  A couple of hundred dollarswould take care of him  and they could leave two of Masons boys withthe vehicles to see that he stayed bribed  he asked  
nodded toward the body of the truck  behind  where his dozen-oddteenage recruits were riding   Yetsko said  
That  Ray knew  was about as high praise as Doug Yetsko could giveanybody  Hed have liked to ask Doug more about CaptainPrestonby--Doug could never seem to get used to the idea of hisofficer being a schoolteacher--but there was no time  The coptertruck was already settling onto the roof The watchman proved amenable to reason  He took one look at Yetsko with three feet of weighted fire hose in his hand  and gulped  thenaccepted the two C-notes Yetsko gave him  They left a couple ofLiterates guards with the vehicles  and Ray led the way to the fireescape  and down into the alley  A few hundred feet away  there was aniron grating which they pulled up  Ray drew the pistol he had gottenout of Captain Prestonbys arms locker and checked the magazine chamber  and safety  knowing that Yetsko and the other guards werewatching him critically  and then started climbing down the ladder The conduit was halfway down  Yetsko  climbing behind him  examined itwith his flashlight  probably wondering how he was going to fithimself into a hole like that  They climbed down onto the concretewalkway beside the conveyor belts  and in the dim light of theoverhead lamps Ray could see that the two broad belts  to and from thestore  were empty for as far as he could see in either direction Normally  there should be things moving constantly in bothdirections--big wire baskets full of parcels for delivery  and trashcontainers  going out  and bales and crates and cases of merchandise and empty delivery baskets and trash containers coming in  He pointedthis out to Yetsko  the big Literates guards sergeant nodded  
 Ray told him  
Yetsko shook his head   Ray said  
 Yetsko told the guards corporal  
Ray and Yetsko and Ramon Nogales started forward  Halfway to the nextconduit port  there was a smear of lubricating oil on the concrete and in it  and away from it in the direction of the store  they foundfootprints  It was Ramon Nogales who noticed the oil on the ladder tothe next conduit port  Yetsko told him  
At the port beyond  they halted  waiting for Masons man to come up They lost some time  thereafter  but they learned that the section ofconduit between the two ports was empty and that the main telephoneline to the store had been cut  Whoever had cut it had gone  eitherforward or back away from the store  A little farther on  the sound ofshots ahead became audible over the clanking and rattling of theconveyor belts  Yetsko said  
One of the boys scouted ahead  and returned to report that they couldreach the next conduit port  but that the section of both conveyorbelts ahead of him was stopped  apparently wedged Yetsko stood for a moment  grimacing in an effort to reach a decision  he said  
 Ray said  
Before Yetsko could object  he started up the ladder  Yetsko behindhim and the others following  At the next conduit port  they couldhear shooting very plainly  seeming to be in front of them  At thenext one  the shooting seemed to be going on directly under them  inthe tunnel  With the flashlight Yetsko had passed forward to him  Raycould see that the dust on the concrete floor of the three-foot bythree-foot passage between and under the power and telephone cableswas undisturbed A little farther on  there was an opening on the left  and a powercable branched off downward  at a sharp angle  overhead  Ray was ableto turn about and get his feet in front of him; Yetsko had to crawl onuntil he had passed it  and then back into it after Ray had entered Bracing one foot on either side  Ray inched his way down theforty-degree slope  hoping that the two hundred pound weight of DougYetsko wouldnt start sliding upon him Ahead  he could hear voices  He drew his hands and feet away from thesides of the branch conduit and let himself slip  landing in a heap inthe electricians shop  above the furnace rooms  Two men  who had beenworking at a bench  trying to assemble a mass of equipment into aradio  whirled  snatching weapons  Ray knew both of them--SamJacobowitz and George Nyman  who serviced the stores communicationsequipment  They both stared at him  swearing in amazement  Ray called out  
       *       *       *       *       *Frank Cardon and Ralph Prestonby were waiting at the freight-elevatordoor when it opened and Russell Latterman emerged  a rifle slung overone shoulder  Cardon stepped forward and took the rifle from him  he said  
They led him to one side  Latterman looked from one to the otherapprehensively  licking his lips him   Prestonby wanted to know  
 Latterman said  
 Cardon nodded  
the rifle back to Latterman   Latterman said  
him  Latterman about the rocket attack on the control tower  which alsohoused the stores telecast station  said   Prestonby said  
They went into Peltons office  The store owner was still lyingmotionless on his stretcher  Claire was fiddling with a telecastreceiving set; she had just tuned out a lecture on HomeBeautifications and had gotten the mid-section of a serial in whichthree couples were somewhat confused over just who was married towhom the knob again  Then she froze  as Elliot C  Mongery--this timesponsored by Parc  the Miracle Cleanser--appeared on the screen Prestonby looked worried  he said  [Illustration:] Cardon suggested  
himself just in time to avoid mentioning the platoon of Literatesguards at the Pelton home  which he was not supposed to know about said   Mongery continued  
 Latterman said  coming up at the moment  
Prestonby asked  Latterman said  
       *       *       *       *       *There was a series of heavy explosions on the floor above  Everybodygrabbed weapons and hurried outside  crowding onto the escalators  Thefloor above was a shambles  with bodies lying about  and thedescending escalator was packed with white-robed attackers  who hadapparently prepared for their charge by tossing down a number ofheavy fragmentation bombs  Cardon had a burp gun  this time; heemptied the fifty-shot magazine into the hooded hoodlums who werecoming down  Prestonby  beside him  had a heavy sono gun; he kept ittrained on the head of the escalator and held the trigger back untilit was empty  then slapped in a fresh clip of the small blankcartridges which produced the sound waves that were amplified andaltered to stunning vibrations  Still  many of the attackers gotthrough  More were dropping down the lift-platform shaft  Cardonssubmachine-gun ceased firing  the action open on an empty clip  Hedropped it and yanked the heavy pistol from his shoulder holster Then  from the direction of the freight elevator  reinforcementsarrived  headed by a huge man in the black leather of the Literatesguard  who swung a three-foot length of fire hose with his right handand fired a pistol with his left  and a boy in a black-and-red jacketwho was letting off a burp gun in deliberate  parsimonious  bursts  Itwas a second or two before Cardon recognized them as Prestonbysbodyguard  Doug Yetsko  and Claire Peltons brother Ray  There werefour Literates guards and about a dozen boys with them  all firingwith a variety of weapons At the same time  others were arriving on the escalators from thefloors below  firing as they came off--Slaters Literates guards  theLiterates and their black-jacketed troopers of Hopkinsons storeservice crew  the fifteen survivors of the twenty riflemen from Macy &Gimbels  The attackers turned and crowded onto the ascendingescalator  Most of them got away  the casualties being carried up bythe escalator  Doug Yetsko bounded forward and brought his fire hosedown on the back of one invaders neck  Then  after a last spatter ofupward-aimed shots from the defenders  there was silence Cardon stepped forward and yanked the hood from the man whom Yetskohad knocked down  hoping that he had a stunned prisoner who could beinterrogated  The man was dead  however  with a broken neck  For amoment  Cardon looked down at the heavy  brutal features of Joe West the Illiterates Organization man  If Chester Pelton got out of thismess alive and won the election tomorrow  there was going to have tobe a purge in the Radical-Socialist party  and something was going tohave to be done about the Consolidated Organization of Illiterates  Heturned to Yetsko  he said  
 Yetsko grinned  
Cardon looked around quickly  in search of Ray  The boy  having comeout of the excitement of battle  was looking around at the litter ofdead and wounded on the blood-splashed floor  His eyes widened  and hegulped  Then  carefully setting the safety of his burp gun andslinging it  he went over and leaned against the wall  and was sick Prestonby  with Claire Pelton beside him  started toward thewhite-faced  retching boy  Yetsko put out a hamlike hand to stop them  he said  
maternal protectiveness  Yetsko told her  
 he declared  
Claire looked up at Prestonby almost worshipfully  Cardon stepped over the body of Joe West and went up to them  he said  
asked Yetsko  Yetsko frowned   Yetsko said  
joining them   Cardon decided  
 he told Claire  
 Claire started to object  
 Cardon said  
 He grinned suddenly  
       *       *       *       *       *The trip out through the conduit was not so difficult  even with theencumbrance of the unconscious Chester Pelton  but Prestonby wasconvinced that  except for the giant strength of Doug Yetsko  it wouldhave been nearly impossible  Ray Pelton  recovered from hisafter-battle nausea and steeled by responsibility  went first  Cardoncrawled after him  followed by a couple of the boys  Then came Yetsko dragging the sleeping bag in which Chester Pelton was packed like amummy  Prestonby himself followed  pushing on his futurefather-in-laws feet  and Claire crawled behind  with the rest ofRays schoolmates for a rearguard They got past the battle which was still going on at the entrance tothe store basement  letting Pelton down with a rope and carrying himonto the outward-bound belt  They left it in time to assemble underthe ladder leading to the alley through which Ray said they hadentered  and hauled Pelton up after them  Then  when they were all outin the open again  Ray ran up the alley and mounted a fire escape and  in a few minutes  a big copter truck which had been parked onthe roof let down to them  Into this  Cardon ordered the unconscioussenatorial candidate loaded  and the boys who had come with Ray Prestonby  which was hovering above  waiting for the truck to leave  scribbled an address and a phone number and a couple of names  Prestonby nodded and watched Cardon climb into the truck  TheLiterates guard who was driving lifted it up and began windmillingaway toward the east  The passenger copter  driven by another guardfrom the school  settled down  Putting Ray and Claire into it  heclimbed in after them  he said  
Rays eyes opened  Claire looked at him inquiringly  saying nothing  he said  
Prestonby shrugged         *       *       *       *       *Russell Latterman noticed that Major Slater was looking at him in arespectfully inquiring manner  He said nothing  and  at length  theLiterates guards officer broke the silence Latterman shook his head  Slater thrust out his hand impulsively   he said  
 He looked around him  
       *       *       *       *       *Cardon watched Chester Pelton apprehensively as the bald-headedmerchant and senatorial candidate sipped from the tall glass in hishand and then set it on the table beside him  His face was pale  andhe had the look of a man who has just been hit with a blackjack Pelton swore vilely  in a lifeless monotone  cursing Literacy  andall Literates back to the invention of the alphabet  Then he stoppedshort Cardon shook his head   Pelton gloomed  
to have reached a point at which he was actually getting a masochisticpleasure out of turning the dagger in his wounds   Cardon told him  impatiently  
Pelton took another gulp from the tall glass at his elbow  emptyingit   he said  
 Then his face clouded again  
Cardon drew a little half-inch record-disk from his pocket case  he said  
Pelton snapped the disk onto his recorder and put in the ear plug Then  before he pressed the stud  he looked at Cardon curiously interruption  one of Literate Frank Cardons best friends; he comforted hisconscience with the knowledge that Mongery would slander him just asunscrupulously  if the interests of the Lancedale Plan were at stake gesture  as though he were picking up some small animal by the scruffof the neck  While Pelton listened to the record  Cardon mixed him another of thehighballs  adding a little of the heart-stimulant the medic had givenhim  Pelton was grinning savagely when he turned off the littlemachine and took out the ear plug  He thought for a moment  
Cardon shook his head         *       *       *       *       *Literate William R  Lancedale looked up from his desk and greeted hisvisitor with a smile Cardon nodded  dropping into a chair beside the desk   Lancedale chuckled  
Cardon shuddered and grimaced horribly  Lancedale grinned at him  Cardon said  passed him the cigar humidor  Cardon  having picked up the Italian stiletto to puncture his cigar looked at it carefully to make sure that it really had no edge  andthen drew it quickly across his throat Illiterates Organization Action Committee people named Joe West andHorace Yingling  both deceased  That was the result of Lattermansbright idea to trap Claire and/or me into betraying Literacy  TheseIlliterate fanatics made up their minds  to speak rather loosely  thatthe whole Pelton family were Literates  including Chet himself  Theydecided that it was better to kill off their candidate and use him fora martyr two years from now than to elect him and have him sell themout  They got about a hundred or so of their goons dressed inIndependent-Conservative KKK costumes  bought air support from PatsyCallazos mob  up in Vermont  and made that attack on the top landingstage  after starting a fake riot in North Jersey  to draw off theregular Radical-Socialist storm troops  Incidentally  when I found outit was Callazos gang that furnished those fighter bombers  I hiredanother mob to go up and drop a block-buster on Callazos field  toteach him to keep his schnozzle out of politics YinglingYingling  myself  after Id gotten reinforcements to the store--firsta couple of free-lance storm troops that the insurance company hired and then as many of the Radical Rangers as I could gather up And Pelton knows about all this
through  as far as any consideration or patronage from the Radicals isconcerned business to pull the Independent-Conservative party together again  to cash inon public dissatisfaction with Peltons socialized Literacy program which ought to be coming apart at the seams by then  And if we havethe Illiterates split into two hostile factions--along  OReilly can only cover me for a short while  and I have to begetting to this victory party of Peltons--times  what a fine job you did  Frank knowing you  Im positive     that youll be able to engineer areconciliation between Pelton and his son and daughter and youngPrestonby  And then  have yourself a good vacation along the old Pennsylvania-New York state line  A little community ofabout a thousand people  where everybody  men  women and children  canread A community of Literates
can read and write place  and I imagine  a couple of hundred years ago  the community wastoo poor to support one of these progressive school systems thatmade Illiterates out of the people in the cities  Probably couldntraise enough money in school taxes to buy all the expensiveaudio-visual equipment  so they had to use old-fashioned textbooks and teach the children to read from them  They have radios  and TV  ofcourse  but they also have a little daily paper  and they have acommunity library be quite a few little enclaves of lower-case-literacy like that  inback-woods and mountain communities  especially in the west and thesouth  Im going to make a project of finding such communities helping them  and getting recruits from them  Theyll fit into thePlan  Well  Ill be seeing you some time tomorrow  I suppose

He really hates all of us  doesnt he
He hates our Team 
of civilians  who arent subject to his regulations and dont have tosalute him  Were working under contract with the Western Union  notwith the United States Government  and as the United States participatesin the Western Union on a treaty basis  our contract has the force of atreaty obligation  It gives us what amounts to extraterritoriality  likeEuropeans in China during the Nineteenth Century  So we have our owntransport  for which he must furnish petrol  and our own armed guard and we fly our own flag over Team Center  and that gripes him as much asanything else  That and the fact that were foreigners  So wouldnt helove to make this espionage rap stick on us!action against us in case we endanger the national security could get shot over this  if were not careful  Dunc  does it reallyhave to be one of our own people who--I dont see how it could be anybody else 
the idea any more than you do  but there it is Well  what are we going to do Is there nobody whom we can trust
who are absolutely loyal  But among the Team itself--the topresearchers--theres nobody Id take a chance on but Kato Sugihara but--I have a couple of reasons for eliminating Kato 
first place  outside nucleonic and binding-force physics  there are onlythree things hes interested in  Jitterbugging  hand-painted neckties and Southern-style cooking  If he went over to the Komintern  hewouldnt be able to get any of those  Then  he only spends about halfhis share of the Teams profits  and turns the rest back into the TeamFund  He has a credit of about a hundred thousand dollars  which hedlose by leaving us  And then  theres another thing  Katos father waskilled on Guadalcanal  in 1942  when he was only five  After that he wasbrought up in the teachings of Bushido by his grandfather  an old-timesamurai  Bushido is open to some criticism  but nobody can show wheredouble-crossing your own gang is good Bushido  And today  Japan isallied with the Western Union  and in any case  he wouldnt help theKomintern  The Japsll forgive Russia for that Mussolini back-stab in1945 after the Irish start building monuments to Cromwell driving dread the thought of sitting at the table with the others  and wonderingwhich of them is betraying us Only nine of us  instead of thirteen  and still one is a Judas 
table interchange-cycle the collapsed-matter research So
what goes on in the hot layer surrounding the EarthNo  Suzanne talked me out of that idea 
just a secondary effect of the effect of cosmic rays and solarradiations on the order of particles existing at that level  But I thinkthat I have the key to the problem of collapsing matter to plate thehull of the spaceship Thats interesting 
How so
atomic structure of matter collision  in which the photon merely bounces off  Macroscopically thats the effect we call reflection of light  Or there may be aninelastic collision  when the photon hits an atom and knocks out anelectron--the old photoelectric effect  Or  the photon may be retainedfor a while and emitted again relatively unchanged--the effect observedin luminous paint  Or  the photon may penetrate  undergo a change to aneutrino  and either remain in the nucleus of the atom or pass throughit  depending upon a number of factors  All this  of course  is oldstuff; even the photon-neutrino interchange has been known since themid-50s  when the Gamow neutrino-counter was developed  But now we cometo what you have been so good as to christen the Sugihara Effect--theneutrino picking up a negative charge and  in effect  turning into anelectron  and then losing its charge  turning back into a neutrino  andthen  as in the case of metal heated to incandescence  being emittedagain as a photon        *       *       *       *       *Heym ben-Hillel was sitting oblivious to everything but his youngcolleagues words  a slice of the flesh of the unclean beast impaled onhis fork and halfway to his mouth  he exclaimed  
Kato grinned  like a tomcat contemplating the bones of a fish he hasjust eaten  He turned to MacLeod  
MacLeod nodded  He handloaded for his  38-special  and like all advancedcases of handloading-fever  he was religiously fanatical aboutuniformity of bullet weights and dimensions  Unlike most handloaders  hehad available the instruments to secure such uniformity  Kato said  
 MacLeod said  He glanced around the table  
 Kato said  
MacLeod rose silently and tiptoed around behind his wife and Rudolf vonHeldenfeld  to touch Kato Sugihara on the shoulder  he whispered  
       *       *       *       *       *The Japanese nodded and rose  following him outside onto the roof abovethe laboratories  They walked over to the edge and stopped at thebalustrade Katos almond-shaped eyes widened  The Japanese sucked in his breath in a sharp hiss   Kato said  
 MacLeod replied  
told him   He paused  
Kato responded to this with a gruesome double-take that gave his facethe fleeting appearance of an ancient samurai war mask  he said  
at MacLeod pleadingly   Kato began  
 MacLeod added  
 Kato pointed out  
 Kato retorted  
 MacLeod said grimly  
 Kato submitted  
MacLeod got out his pipe and lit it  For a long time  he stared outacross the mountain-ringed vista of sagebrush  dotted at wide intervalswith the bulks of research-centers and the red roofs of the villages said         *       *       *       *       *The next day started in an atmosphere of suppressed excitement andanxiety  which  beginning with MacLeod and Karen and Kato Sugihara seemed to communicate itself by contagion to everybody in the MacLeodTeams laboratories  The top researchers and their immediate assistantsand students were the first to catch it; they ascribed the tension underwhich their leader and his wife and the Japanese labored to the recentdevelopments in the collapsed-matter problem  Then  there were about adozen implicitly-trusted technicians and guards  who had been secretlygathered in MacLeods office the night before and informed of the crisisthat had arisen  Their associates could not miss the fact that they werepreoccupied with something unusual They were a variegated crew; men who had been added to the Team in everycorner of the world  There was Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman  the Arab jeep-driverwho had joined them in Basra  There was the wiry little Greek whomeverybody called Alex Unpronounceable  There was an Italian  and twoChinese  and a cashiered French Air Force officer  and a Malay  and theson of an English earl who insisted that his name was Bertie Wooster They had sworn themselves to secrecy  had heard MacLeods story with apolylingual burst of pious or blasphemous exclamations  and then theyhad scattered  each to the work assigned him MacLeod had risen early and submitted to the ordeal of the search toleave the reservation and go to town again  this time for a conferenceat the shabby back-street cigar store that concealed a Counter Espionagecenter  He had returned just as Farida Khouroglu was finishing themicrofilm copies of Katos ingeniously-concocted pseudo-data  Thesecopies were distributed at noon  while the Team was lunching  along withcarbons of the original type-script He was the first to leave the table  going directly to the basement where Alex Unpronounceable and the man who had got his alias from theworks of P  G  Wodehouse were listening in on the telephone calls goingin and out through the Team-center switch-board  and making recordings For two hours  MacLeod remained with them  He heard Suzanne Maillard andsome woman who was talking from a number in the Army married-officerssettlement making arrangements about a party  He heard Rudolf vonHeldenfeld make a date with some girl  He listened to a violentaltercation between the Team chef and somebody at Army QuartermastersHQ about the quality of a lot of dressed chicken  He listened to a callthat came in for Adam Lowiewski  the mathematician  the caller said  
 Lowiewskis voice replied  
Bertie Wooster looked up sharply  The telephone beside MacLeod rang  He scooped it up; named himself intoit It was Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman  answered   MacLeod told him  
MacLeod hung up and straightened  feeling under his packet for his 38-special  he said  
cylinder  He spoke briefly in description of the Polish mathematiciansancestry  physical characteristics  and probable post-mortemdestination  Then he put the gun away  and the three men left thebasement        *       *       *       *       *For minutes that seamed like hours  MacLeod and the Greek waited on themain floor  where they could watch both the elevators and the stairway Bertie Wooster had gone up to alert Kato Sugihara and Karen  Then thedoor of one of the elevators opened and Adam Lowiewski emerged  withKato behind him  apparently lost in a bulky scientific journal he wasreading  The Greek moved in from one side  and MacLeod stepped in frontof the Pole  he greeted  
within the bounds of politeness   MacLeod told him  
There was a split second in which Lowiewski struggled--almostsuccessfully--to erase the consternation from his face started to slide under his left coat lapel MacLeods Colt was covering him before he could complete the movement At the same time  Kato Sugihara dropped the paper-bound periodical revealing the thin-bladed knife he had concealed under it  He steppedforward  pressing the point of the weapon against the Poles side  Withthe other hand  he reached across Lowiewskis chest and jerked thepistol from his shoulder-holster  It was one of the elegant little  32Beretta 1954 Model automatics knife emphasized the order   Lowiewski began  
Without even replying  MacLeod slammed the doors and started theelevator upward  letting it rise six floors to the living quarters Karen Hilquist and the aristocratic black-sheep who called himselfBertie Wooster were waiting when he opened the door  The Englishman tookone of Lowiewskis arms; MacLeod took the other  The rest fell in behindas they hustled the captive down the hall and into the big sound-proofeddining room  They kept Lowiewski standing  well away from any movableobject in the room; Alex Unpronounceable took his left arm as MacLeodreleased it and went to the communicator and punched the all-outletsbutton  he called  
       *       *       *       *       *Karen said something to the Japanese and went outside  For a while nobody spoke  Kato came over and lit a cigarette in the bowl ofMacLeods pipe  Then the other Team members entered in a body  EvidentlyKaren had intercepted them in the hallway and warned them that theywould find some unusual situation inside; even so  there was a burst ofsurprised exclamations when they found Adam Lowiewski under detention  MacLeod said  
 Suzanne Maillard said  
 Lowiewski derided  
went on  He exhibited the Beretta  Englishman        *       *       *       *       *They did their work thoroughly  A pile of Lowiewskis pocket effects wasmade on the table; as each item was added to it  the Pole made somesarcastic comment  he jeered  
suggested  He used the point of his knife to illustrate  The cellophane cameunsealed with surprising ease: so did the revenue stamp  He dumped outthe contents of the pack: sixteen cigarettes  four cigarette tip-ends four bits snapped from the other ends--and a small aluminum microfilmcapsule Lowiewskis face twitched  For an instant  he tried vainly to breakloose from the men who held him  Then he slumped into a chair  Heymben-Hillel gasped in shocked surprise  Suzanne Maillard gave a short felinelike cry  Sir Neville Lawton looked at the capsule curiously andsaid: picking it up  She opened it and pulled out a roll of colloidexprojection film  There was also a bit of cigarette paper in the capsule upon which a notation had been made in Kyrilic characters Rudolf von Heldenfeld could read Russian  The film and the paper passed from hand to hand  The other members ofthe Team sat down; there was a tendency to move away from the chairoccupied by Adam Lowiewski  He noticed this and sneered  he asked  
Kato Sugihara picked up the capsule  took a final glance at thecigarette pack  and said to MacLeod: Greek        *       *       *       *       *Heym ben-Hillel turned to the others: his eyes had the hurt and puzzledlook of a dog that has been kicked for no reason   MacLeod replied  
He was watching Lowiewskis face keenly   he continued  
 Suzanne Maillard wanted to know  
MacLeod shook his head  Sir Neville Lawton gave a strangling laugh   MacLeod said  
 Heym ben-Hillel gloomed  
 Suzanne Maillard demanded  
Israeli pointed out   Sir Neville Lawton agreed  
 Suzanne cried  
 Rudolf von Heldenfeld said  
       *       *       *       *       *Kato Sugihara  returning alone  looked around the table   Lowiewski told him  
Kato nodded quickly  He nodded again   Sir Neville objected  
said   MacLeod shrugged  
 Kato grinned  
 Farida suggested  
 Suzanne protested  
exaggerated shudder   Karen said  
Heym ben-Hillel looked at MacLeod  his eyes troubled  he asked  
Von Heldenfeld shouted  banging his fist on the table:        *       *       *       *       *Lowiewski was smiling  now  The panic that had seized him in the hallwaybelow  and the desperation when the cigarette pack had been opened  hadleft him said  Rudolf von Heldenfeld let out an inarticulate roar of fury  For aninstant he was beyond words  Then he sprang to his feet  he cried  
MacLeod   Karen Hilquist contradicted  
Heym ben-Hillel put his elbows on the table and his head in his hands  MacLeod said  rising  
clicked a period to his words was on his feet  a sudden desperate fear in his face  he shot Adam Lowiewski through the forehead For an instant  the Pole remained on his feet  Then his knees buckled and he fell forward against the table  sliding to the floor        *       *       *       *       *MacLeod went around the table  behind Kato Sugihara and Farida Khourogluand Heym ben-Hillel  and stood looking down at the man he had killed  Hedropped the automatic within a few inches of the dead renegadesoutstretched hand  then turned to face the others Sir Neville Lawton looked critically at the motionless figure on thefloor  he said  
 MacLeods voice was mockingly contrite  
protested  MacLeod reminded him  
 Suzanne Maillard cried  
Heym ben-Hillel  who had been staring at MacLeod in shocked unbelief roused himself  He turned to MacLeod  
 MacLeod said  
nations of the world tolerate the Free Scientists only because they needus  and because they know they can trust us  Now  no responsiblegovernment official is going to be deceived for a moment by this suicidestory weve confected  It will be fully understood that Lowiewski was atraitor  and that we found him out and put him to death  And  as acorollary  it will be understood that this Team  as a Team  is fullytrustworthy  and that when any individual Team member is found to beuntrustworthy  he will be dealt with promptly and without publicscandal  In other words  it will be understood  from this time on  thatthe MacLeod Team is worthy of the status it enjoys and theresponsibilities concomitant with it

Oh  no! I hadnt even thought of that 
You have no idea of the state into which things have gotten     Oh pardon me  Mr  Ambassador  I am Gilbert W  Thrombley  your chargédaffaires Secretary of the Embassy We got a tail  boss! Two of them! Look back there!
What the devils the matter  Thrombley
Mr  Silk
Stonehenge; Space-Commander  Space Navy What happenedup  and they speeded up  too  Then your fly-boy  here  got fancy  Thatshook em off  Time we got into the city  wed dropped them  Nice job ofdriving  Probably saved our lives Shucks  that wasnt nothin 
for politicians  youre either good or youre good and dead Im surprised they started so soon 
here in the hot sun Im Captain Nelson; New Texas Rangers 
one of you-all is Mr  Stephen SilkI just cant figure this out 
the right company  but we got a report  from a mighty good source  thatyoud been kidnapped at the spaceport by a gang of thugs!A blond source
her  My efficient and conscientious chargé daffaires  Mr  Thrombley felt that I should reach the Embassy  here  as soon as possible  andfrom where she was standing  it must have looked like a kidnapping Fact is  it looked like one from where I was standing  too Was that you and your people who were chasing us Then I must apologizefor opening fire on you     I hope nobody was hurt one of them  but no harm done  I reckon after what happened to SilasCumshaw  you had a right to be suspicious Can I offer you a drink  Captain  in token of mutual amity
Well  now  Id like to  Mr  Ambassador  but Im on duty    
Texas  and in this Embassy  youre in the territory of the SolarLeague Thats right  now  Mr  Ambassador 
Wonderful thing  extraterritoriality And diplomatic immunity  too  Aint it  Hoddy
immediately  sir  Only a public statement  issued promptly  will relievethe crisis into which we have all been thrust Oh  come  Mr  Thrombley 
all that in his report to his superiors effect that you have assumed full responsibility for the Embassy  Whereis that thing Mr  Gomez!Here  sir; just sign here 
Are you crazy
Ive taken an inventory of the physical property of the Embassy  andfamiliarized myself with all its commitments  and had the books auditedby some firm of certified public accountants But we must have a statement of assumption of responsibility    
do anything Wait a moment  Thrombley 
attitude  Ive taken command of a good many ships and installations  atone time or another  and Ive never signed for anything I couldnt seeand feel and count  I know men who retired as brigadier generals orvice-admirals  but they retired loaded with debts incurred because assecond lieutenants or ensigns they forgot that simple rule Silk  this Embassy has been pretty badly disorganized since Mr Cumshaws death  No one felt authorized  or  to put it more accurately no one dared  to declare himself acting head of the Embassy--Because that would make him the next target
thats what I was sent here for  Mr  Gomez  as Secretary of the Embassy will you please  at once  prepare a statement for the press and telecastrelease to the effect that I am now the authorized head of this Embassy responsible from this hour for all its future policies and all itspresent commitments insofar as they obligate the government of the SolarLeague  Get that out at once  Tomorrow  I will present my credentials tothe Secretary of State here  Thereafter  Mr  Thrombley  you can rest inthe assurance that Ill be the one theyll be shooting at But you cant wait that long  Mr  Ambassador 
already going on Thrombleythat the ship was in orbit off-planet got in  Itll be a barbecue  ofcourse  and--Barbecued supercow! Yipeee!
five years!But we must hurry  Mr  Ambassador 
change  now  to formal dress    In native dress  Mr  Ambassador!
And armed!Consular Service  I sincerely hope that you will not take it amiss if Ipoint out  here in private  that--direct order of Secretary of State Ghopal Singh I     I cant believe it!
armed nations and the usages of diplomatic practice  no fate of Mr  Cumshaw clearly indicates that the government of New Texasis not such a government  These pistols are in the nature of anot-too-subtle hint of the manner in which this government  here  isbeing regarded by the government of the Solar League Commander  what sort of an Embassy guard have we
Space Marines  sergeant and five men  I double as guard officer  sir 
this fish-fry or whatever it is immediately  I want two men  a driverand an auto-rifleman  for my car  And from now on  I would suggest Commander  that you wear your sidearm at all times outside the Embassy Yes  sir!
Well  I must phone the Statehouse  then 
to call on Secretary of State Palme  and then on President Hutchinson Space Navy on maneuvers about five light-years from here Sir Rodney Tregaskis hurrycharter Tregaskis that the Ambassador at New Austin feels in need of protection;possibility of zSrauff invasion  Ill give you written orders  I wantthe Fleet within radio call  How far out would that be  with ourfacilitiessir it comes  will probably not come from the direction of the zSrauffstar-cluster; theyll probably jump past us and move in from the otherside  I hope you dont think Im having nightmares  Commander  Danger ofa zSrauff invasion was pointed out to me by persons on the very highestlevel  on Luna Especially since this special envoy arrived here  ostensibly tonegotiate a meteor-mining treaty want the New Texans to know  of course  that youve sent for the fleetNaturally not 
boat owned  manned and operated by Solar League people  The boats adreadful-looking old tub  but shes sound and fast  The gang who own herare pretty notorious characters--suspected of smuggling  piracy  andwhat not--but theyll keep their mouths shut if well paid Then pay them well 
at once  When I get back from this clambake  Ill want to have a generalinformal council  and I certainly want you in on it dont    Were dreadfully late

Well  those nine men are judges 
President Judge Nelson  Youve met his son--the Ranger officer whochased you from the spaceport  Hes a regular jurist  The other eightare prominent citizens who are drawn from a panel  like a jury  The menat the table on the left are the prosecution: friends of the politicianwho was killed  And the ones on the right are the defense: theyll tryto prove that the dead man got what was coming to him  The ones in themiddle are friends of the court: theyre just anybody who has anyinterest in the case--people who want to get some point of law clearedup  or see some precedent established  or something like that You seem to assume that this is a homicide case 
but--Are you gentlemen ready
Political Justice of the Confederate Continents of New Texas is now insession  Case of the friends of S  Austin Maverick  deceased  late ofJames Bowie Continent  versus Wilbur Whately My God  did somebody finally kill Aus Maverick
The general nature of the case 
defendant  Wilbur Whately  of Sam Houston Continent  is here chargedwith divers offenses arising from the death of the Honorable S  AustinMaverick  whom he killed on the front steps of the Legislative AssemblyBuilding  here in New Austin    I want to hear the specifications 
Please the court 
charged with political irresponsibility and excessive atrocity inexercising his constitutional right of criticism of a practicingpolitician The court wanted to know how the defendant would plead  Somebody without bothering to rise  said  defense table There was a brief scraping of chairs; four of five men from the defenseand the prosecution tables got up and advanced to confer in front of thebench  comparing sheets of paper  The man who had read the charges obviously the chief prosecutor  made himself the spokesman The defense answered affirmatively  I sat back  gaping like a fool  Why that was practically--no  it was--a confession  the judge said  
As though there were any case to get on with! I fully expected them totake it on from there in song  words by Gilbert and music by Sullivan prosecution--prosecution  for Gods sake!--announced  the defense said  
the defense demanded  said  Nelson inquired in The prosecution hemmed and hawed for a moment  and then announced  in ahasty mumble  that it rested  Judge Nelson said  
And then  he actually closed the court; pressing a button on the bench he raised a high black screen in front of him and his colleagues  Itstayed up for some sixty seconds  and then dropped again The defense lawyer motioned a young man who had been sitting beside himto rise  In the silence that had fallen  I could hear the defendantsboots squeaking as he went forward to hear his fate  The judge picked upa belt and a pair of pistols that had been lying in front of him  he began  
political irresponsibility; one of the associate judges felt that thelate unmitigated scoundrel  Austin Maverick  ought to have been skinnedalive  an inch at a time  You are  however  acquitted of that charge too  he continued  addressing the entire assemblage  
He leaned forward  extending the belt and holsters to the defendant Some of the spectators  drooling for barbecued supercow  began crowdingand jostling toward the exits; more of them were pushing to the front ofthe courtroom  cheering and waving their hip-flasks  The prosecutionand about half of the friends of the court hastily left by a side door probably to issue statements disassociating themselves from the deceasedMaverick  I commented  as Gail and I went out  
 She was indignant  
I was thoughtfully silent as we went out into the plaza  which was stilla riot of noise and polychromatic costumes  And my thoughts were asweltered as the scene before me Apparently  on New Texas  killing a politician wasnt regarded asmallum in se  and was mallum prohibitorum only to the extent thatwhat happened to the politician was in excess of what he deserved  Ibegan to understand why Palme was such a scared rabbit  why Hutchinsonhad that hunted look and kept his hands always within inches of hispistols I began to feel more pity than contempt for Thrombley  too  Hes beenon this planet too long and he should never have been sent here in thefirst place  Ill rotate him home as soon as possible    Then the full meaning of what I had seen finally got through to me: ifthey were going to try the killers of Cumshaw in that court  that meantthat on New Texas  foreign diplomats were regarded as practicingpoliticians    That made me a practicing politician too!And thats why  when we got back to the vicinity of the bandstand  Ihad my right hand close to my pistol  with my thumb on the inconspicuouslittle spot of silver inlay that operated the secret holster mechanism I saw Hutchinson and Palme and Thrombley ahead  With them was anewcomer  a portly  ruddy-faced gentleman with a white mustache andgoatee  dressed in a white suit  Gail broke away from me and ran towardhim  This  I thought  would be her father; now I would be introduced andfind out just what her last name was  I followed  more slowly  and saw awaiter  with a wheeled serving-table  move in behind the group which shehad joined So I saw what none of them did--the waiter suddenly reversed his longcarving-knife and poised himself for a blow at President Hutchinsonsback  I simply pressed the little silver stud on my belt  theKrupp-Tatta popped obediently out of the holster into my open hand  Ithumbed off the safety and swung up; when my sights closed on the risinghand that held the knife  I fired Hoddy Ringo  who had been holding a sandwich with one hand and a drinkwith the other  dropped both and jumped on the man whose hand I hadsmashed  A couple of Rangers closed in and grabbed him  also  The grouparound President Hutchinson had all turned and were staring from me tothe man I had shot  and from him to the knife with the broken handle lying on the ground Hutchinson spoke first   Hoddy accused  
 the man with the white goatee said  
me  I holstered my automatic  and took his hand  Gail was saying  was doing it more formally:Dumbarton Oaks had taught me how to maintain the proper diplomatsunchanging expression; drinking superbourbon had been a post-graduatecourse  I needed that training as I finally learned Gails last name CHAPTER VIIt was early evening before we finally managed to get away from thebarbecue  Thrombley had called the Embassy and told them not to waitdinner for us  so the staff had finished eating and were relaxing in thepatio when our car came in through the street gate  Stonehenge andanother man came over to meet us as we got out--a man I hadnt metbefore He was a little fellow  half-Latin  half-Oriental; in New Texas costumeand wearing a pair of pistols like mine  in State Department SpecialServices holsters  He didnt look like a Dumbarton Oaks product: Ithought he was more likely an alumnus of some private detective agency  Parros said  
We went over and sat down at one of the big tables under the arches atthe side of the patio  I said  
as the Intelligence man picked up a bottle and made to pour for me Thrombley stirred uneasily  I wondered what hed say if I told him that I thought it wasdeliberate So they began; Thrombley  Stonehenge and Parros doing the talking  Itcame to this:Ever since we had first established an Embassy on New Texas  the goal ofour diplomacy on this planet had been to secure it into the SolarLeague  And it was a goal which seemed very little closer to realizationnow than it had been twenty-three years before told him  Thrombley wasnt much in the way of an ally  but at least he had asound  selfish motive for helping me stay alive  I assured him I wouldget him sent back to Luna  and then went on with the discussion Up until six months ago  Silas Cumshaw had modeled himself after thetypical New Texas politician  He had always worn at least two faces  andhad always managed to place himself on every side of every issue atonce  Nothing he ever said could possibly be construed as controversial Naturally  the cause of New Texan annexation to the Solar League hadmade no progress whatever Then  one evening  at a banquet  he had executed a complete 180-degreeturn  delivering a speech in which he proclaimed that union with theSolar League was the only possible way in which New Texans could retaineven a vestige of local sovereignty  He had talked about an invasion asthough the enemys ships were already coming out of hyperspace  and hadnamed the invader  calling the zSrauff Ambassador  also present  had immediately gotten up and stalked out amid a derisive chorus of barking and baying from the New Texans  TheNew Texans were first shocked and then wildly delighted; they had beenso used to hearing nothing but inanities and high-order abstractionsfrom their public figures that the Solar League Ambassador had become ahero overnight  Parros told me  
 I said  
 Thrombley replied  
celebrating some military victory by the Texans on Terra  a battlecalled San Jacinto  We didnt have any business to handle  because allthe local officials were home nursing hangovers  so when Colonel Hickockcalled--Who
at the barbecue  He and Mr  Cumshaw had become great friends  beginningshortly before the speech the Ambassador made at that banquet  He calledabout 0900  inviting Mr  Cumshaw out to his ranch for the day  and asthere was nothing in the way of official business  Mr  Cumshaw said hedbe out by 1030 over  from the ranch house caught their jet assembly  and they could only getas far as Bonneyville  thirty miles away  before they had to land  Theylanded right in front of the town jail Turkey-Buzzard Tom Bonney--immediately claimed sanctuary in the jail  onthe grounds that they had been near to--get that; I think that indicatesthe line theyre going to take at the trial--near to a politicalassassination  They were immediately given the protection of the jail which is about the only well-constructed building in the place practically a fort You think that was planned in advance
these Bonneys at the jail  almost the entire able-bodied population ofthe place  As soon as Switchblade and Jack-High and Turkey-Buzzardlanded  they were rushed inside and all the doors barred  About threeminutes later  the Hickock outfit started coming in  first aircraft andthen armor  They gave that town a regular Georgie Patton styleblitzing Yes  Im only sorry I wasnt there to see it 
knocked down or burned most of the shanties  and then they went to workon the jail  The aircraft began dumping these firebombs and stun-bombsthat they use to stop supercow stampedes  and the tank-guns began topunch holes in the walls  As soon as Kettle-Belly saw what he had on hishands  he radioed a call for Ranger protection  Our friend CaptainNelson went out to see what the trouble was Yes  I got the story of that from Nelson 
hated to do it  he had to protect the Bonneys  And as soon as hed takena hand  Hickock had to call off his gang  But he was smart  He grabbedeverything relating to the killing--the aircar and the twenty-mmauto-rifle in particular--and hes keeping them under cover  Very fewpeople know about that  or about the fact that on physical evidencealone  he has the killing pinned on the Bonneys so well that theyllnever get away with this story of being merely innocent witnesses The rest  Mr  Silk  is up to us 
Hickocks assurance that he will give us every assistance  but we simplymust see to it that those creatures with the outlandish names areconvicted Good evening  Captain 
youre on foreign soil and consequently not on duty I thought you might be interested 
going-over  We wanted to know who put him up to it  He tried to sell usthe line that he was a New Texan patriot  trying to kill a tyrant  butwe finally got the truth out of him  He was paid a thousand pesos to dothe job  by a character they call Snake-Eyes Sam Bonney  A cousin of thethree who killed Mr  Cumshaw Nephew of Kettle-Belly Sam 
You pick him up
somewhere  Were still looking for him  Oh  yes  and I just heard thatthe trial of Switchblade  and Jack-High and Turkey-Buzzard is scheduledfor three days from now  Youll be notified in due form tomorrow  but Ithought you might like to know in advance you when you arrived whatever you call it  of that trio boys didnt get hold of them before I got there  Itd of saved everybodya lot of trouble Just what impression did you get at the time  Captain
think Kettle-Belly knew in advance what they were going to dois  to keep people from getting out; but like a fort  to keep peoplefrom getting in  There were no prisoners inside  I found out that theyhad all been released that morning that I figure went wrong with their plans He cocked an eyebrow and I nodded  The Solar League  in similar cases had regarded such planetary governments as due for change without noticeand had promptly made the change  Captain Nelson continued  
him The big Ranger grinned  were trying to defend the mayors office and the wardens office  TheseBonneys gave me the line that theyd been witnesses to the killing ofMr  Cumshaw by Colonel Hickock and that the Hickock outfit was trying torub them out to keep them from testifying  I just laughed and started towalk out  Finally  they confessed that theyd shot Mr  Cumshaw  but theyclaimed it was right of action against political malfeasance  When theydid that  I had to take them in They confessed to you  before you arrested them
held  And that aint all: we got their fingerprints off the car  off thegun  off some shells still in the clip  and we have the gun identifiedto the shells that killed Mr  Cumshaw  We got their confession fullycorroborated Youll have to look to your laurels  Hoddy 
Ambassador seems to be making quite a reputation for himself as agunfighter Look 
shoot myself  That way  I could be sure Id get a nice painless job to be a carefully prearranged killing Hickocks front steps at about 1030  How did they find that outWhy     why  Im sure I dont know 
called at 0900  Mr  Cumshaw left the Embassy in an aircar a few minuteslater  It took an hour and a half to fly out to the Hickock ranch    I dont like the implications  Mr  Silk 
believe that was how it happened  In the first place  Colonel Hickockisnt that sort of man: he doesnt use his hospitality to trap people totheir death  In the second place  he wouldnt have needed to use peoplelike these Bonneys  His own men would do anything for him  In the thirdplace  he is one of the leaders of the annexation movement here and thiswas obviously an anti-annexation job  And in the fourth place--Hold it!
sideSilk  But  remember  when Colonel Hickock came here as our firstAmbassador  he came here as a man with a mission  He had studied theproblem and he believed in what he came for  He has never changed Colonel and Mr  Cumshaw were really friends Now youre talking!
was a kid  Ever since he married old Colonel MacTodds daughter  Thatjust aint the way A  J  works!On the other hand  Mr  Ambassador 
did do everything in his power to see that these Bonney brothers did notreach court alive  And  let me add Hickock told them  or we have--and this is unbelievable--a traitor inthe Embassy itself Nobody who knew could have told the Bonney boys where Mr  Cumshaw wouldbe at 1030  yet the three men were there waiting for him  You take itfrom there  Im just a simple military man and Im ready to go back tothe simple military life as soon as possible official telescreen log  Lets see what calls were made  Maybe Mr Cumshaw himself said something to someone that gave his destinationaway That wont be necessary 
were on duty  and I took the only three calls that came in  myself First  there was the call from Colonel Hickock  Then  the call about thewrist watch  And then  a couple of hours later  the call from theHickock ranch  about Mr  Cumshaws death What was the call about the wrist watch
Oh  that was from the zSrauff Embassy 
time  Mr  Cumshaw had been trying to get one of the very precisewatches which the zSrauff manufacture on their home planet  ThezSrauff Ambassador called  that day  to tell him that they had one forhim and wanted to know when it was to be delivered  I told them theAmbassador was out  and they wanted to know where they could call himand I--Oh  my God! Im the one who told them!
Thrombley You did the natural  the normal  the proper thing  on a callfrom one Ambassador to another Ambassador had left the Embassy  Alone  right And that was just whattheyd been waiting for  Stonehenge interrupted  
Stonehenge deliberately paused  let that last phrase hang heavily in theair for a moment  then he continued electric shock  or ringing a little bell  all over New Texas  at exactlythe same moment  And then I can imagine all the zSrauff running downinto nice deep holes in the ground at the spaceport by now  ready to blast off  I wonder if someone coulddrive me there Ill drive him  boss 
I aint doin nothin else 
I have a lot of stuff here 
have noticed  For instance--Commander Stonehenges going to the spaceport  now 
the way  Then  when hes aboard  come back and tell us What do you think of our planet now  Mr  Silk
I received Especially with your opinion of local political practices  Politics isnothing  here  if not exciting and exacting You dont understand it though 
pigeons Well  it is rather unusual    
Yes 
Century Liberal on end  And it gives us the freest government anywherein the galaxy invaded or threatened their rights became an acknowledged part of ourpolitical system said forcefully  and powerful and its your master  We dont want any masters here onNew Texas But the President has a bodyguard 
Casualty rate was too high 
Presidents job is inherently impossible: he has to represent all thepeople your rancher oligarchythe morning  theyd find my body in an irrigation ditch before sunset We left the Hickock ranch on Sunday afternoon and while Hoddy guided ourair-car back to New Austin  I had a little time to revise some of myideas about New Texas  That is  I had time to think during those fewmoments when Hoddy wasnt taking advantage of our diplomatic immunity toinvent new air-ground traffic laws My thoughts alternated between the pleasure of remembering Gails gaycompany and the gloom of understanding the complete implications of theColonels clarifying lectures  Against the background of his remarks  Icould find myself appreciating the Ghopal-Klüng-Natalenko reasoning: theonly way to cut the Gordian knot was to have another Solar LeagueAmbassador killed And  whenever I could escape thinking about the fact that the nextAmbassador to be the clay pigeon was me  I found myself wondering if Iwanted the League to take over  Annexation  yes; New Texas customs wouldbe protected under a treaty of annexation  But the urged by Machiavelli  Jr  No I was still struggling with the problem when we reached the Embassyabout 1700  Everyone was there  including Stonehenge  who had returnedtwo hours earlier with the good news that the fleet had moved intoposition only sixty light-minutes off Capella IV  I had reached thepoint in my thinking where I had decided it was useless to keep Hoddyand Stonehenge apart except as an exercise in mental agility  Inasmuchas my brain was already weight-lifting  swinging from a flying trapezeto elusive flying rings while doing triple somersaults and at the sametime juggling seven Indian clubs  I skipped the whole matter But Im fairly certain that it wasnt till then that Hoddy had a chanceto deliver his letter-of-credence to Stonehenge After dinner  we gathered in my office for our coffee and a finalconference before the opening of the trial the next morning Stonehenge spoke first  looking around the table at everyone except me No matter what happens  I thought glumly  and the phrase explained whyhe hadnt been able to look at me  Hoddy said  
 Stonehenge said  
 Parros told him  
at the trial  They have a lawyer  Clement A  Sidney  a member of whatpasses for the Socialist Party on this planet  The defense will take theline of full denial of everything  The Bonneys are just three poor buthonest boys who are being framed by the corrupt tools of the BigRanching Interests Whatta we got to worry about  then
Theyre a cinch for conviction 
I agree with that 
defense on political conviction and opposition by the Solar League  theymight have a chance  This way  they havent All right  gentlemen 
must all follow a single line of policy and not work at cross-purposesto each othercircumstances  allow those three brothers to be convicted in thiscourt remarkable statement  but I must say--It was a really colossal error on somebodys part 
case was allowed to get into the Court of Political Justice  It nevershould have  And if we take a part in the prosecution  or allow thosemen to be convicted  we will establish a precedent to support theprinciple that a foreign Ambassador is  on this planet  defined as apracticing local politician A moment was all they needed  Thrombley was horrified and ditheredincoherently  Stonehenge frowned and fidgeted with some papers in frontof him  I could see several thoughts gathering behind his eyes including  I was sure  a new view of his instructions from Klüng Even Hoddy got at least part of it   Thrombley told him  
 Stonehenge picked it up  
an army of New Texas Rangers  each with a warrant for Hoddy Ringo battering at the gates  Stonehenge said  
I had been thinking about this and I was ready   Parros said  
I wasnt surprised that he didnt see it; he hadnt had the same urgencygoading him which had forced me to find the answer  It wasnt an answerthat I liked  but I was in the position where I had no choice respectful way they regarded me  from the attention they were giving mywords  I got a sudden thrill of pride  For the first time since myscrambled arrival  I was really Ambassador Stephen Silk CHAPTER VIIIA couple of New Texas Ranger tanks met the Embassy car four blocks fromthe Statehouse and convoyed us into the central plaza  where thebarbecue had been held on the Friday afternoon that I had arrived on NewTexas  There was almost as dense a crowd as the last time I had seen theplace; but they were quieter  to the extent that there were no bands and no shooting  no cowbells or whistles  The barbecue pits were goingagain  however  and hawkers were pushing or propelling their littlewagons about  vending sandwiches  I saw a half a dozen big twenty-footteleview screens  apparently wired from the courtroom As soon as the Embassy car and its escorting tanks reached the plaza  anovation broke out  I was cheered  with the high-pitched yipeee! of NewTexans and adjured and implored not to let them so-and-sos get away withit There was a veritable army of Rangers on guard at the doors of thecourtroom  The only spectators being admitted to the courtroom seemed tobe prominent citizens with enough pull to secure passes Inside  some of the spectators benches had been removed to clear thefront of the room  In the cleared space  there was one bulky shapeunder a cloth cover that seemed to be the air-car and anothercloth-covered shape that looked like a fifty-mm dual-purpose gun Smaller exhibits  including a twenty-mm auto-rifle  were piled on thefriends-of-the-court table  The prosecution table was alreadyoccupied--Colonel Hickock  who waved a greeting to me  three or four menwho looked like well-to-do ranchers  and a delegation of lawyers heavy-set man with white hair  dressed in a dark suit of the cut thathad been fashionable on Terra seventy-five years ago  There was quite a swarm at the center table  too  Some of them wereranchers  a couple in aggressively shabby workclothes  and there wereseveral members of the Diplomatic Corps  I shook hands with them andgathered that they  like myself  were worried about the precedent thatmight be established by this trial  While I was introducing Hoddy Ringoas my attaché extraordinary  which was no less than the truth  thedefense party came in There were only three lawyers--a little  rodent-faced fellow  whomParros pointed out as Clement Sidney  and two assistants  And  guardedby a Ranger and a couple of court-bailiffs  the three defendants Switchblade Joe  Jack-High Abe and Turkey-Buzzard Tom Bonney  There wasprobably a year or so age different from one to another  but theycertainly had a common parentage  They all had pale eyes and narrow loose-lipped faces  Subnormal and probably psychopathic  I thought Jack-High Abe had his left arm in a sling and his left shoulder in aplaster cast  The buzz of conversation among the spectators altered itstone subtly and took on a note of hostility as they entered and seatedthemselves The balcony seemed to be crowded with press representatives  Severaltelecast cameras and sound pickups had been rigged to cover the front ofthe room from various angles  a feature that had been missing from thetrial I had seen with Gail on Friday Then the judges entered from a door behind the bench  which must haveopened from a passageway under the plaza  and the court was called toorder The President Judge was the same Nelson who had presided at the Whatelytrial and the first thing on the agenda seemed to be the selection of anew board of associate judges  Parros explained in a whisper that theboard which had served on the previous trial would sit until that couldbe done A slip of paper was drawn from a box and a name was called  A mansitting on one of the front rows of spectators seats got up and cameforward  One of Sidneys assistants rummaged through a card file he hadin front of him and handed a card to the chief of the defense  At once Sidney was on his feet  he called out  
 the venireman declared  
 Sidney almost screamed  
Judge Nelson pounded with his gavel   he said  
The next man was challenged: he was a retired packing-house operator inNew Austin  and had once expressed the opinion that Bonneyville andeverybody in it ought to be H-bombed off the face of New Texas This Sidney seemed to have gotten the name of everybody likely to becalled for court duty and had something on each one of them  because hewent on like that all morning Parros   Hoddy offered  
 I decided  
We took an hour  at noon  for lunch  and then it began again  By 1647 fifteen minutes before court should be adjourned  Judge Nelson orderedthe bailiff to turn the clock back to 1300  The clock was turned backagain when it reached 1645  By this time  Clement Sidney was probablythe most unpopular man on New Texas Finally  Colonel Andrew J  Hickock rose to his feet Sidney began yelling protests  Hoddy Ringo pulled his neckerchief aroundunder his left ear and held the ends above his head  Nanadabadian  theAmbassador from Beta Cephus IV  drew his biggest knife and began tryingthe edge on a sheet of paper rapped with his gavel  CHAPTER IXThe trial got started the next morning with a minimum amount ofobjections from Sidney  The charges and specifications were duly read the three defendants pleaded not guilty  and then Goodham advanced witha paper in his hand to address the court  Sidney scampered up to takehis position beside him In all my planning  Id forgotten that  I couldnt let thosestipulations stand without protest  and at the same time  if I protestedthe characterization of Cumshaw as a practicing politician  the trialcould easily end right there  So I prayed for a miracle  and ClementSidney promptly obliged me  he barked  
Judge Nelsons gavel hit the bench with a crack like a rifle shot I settled back with a deep sigh of relief which got me  I noticed curious stares from my fellow Ambassadors  I disregarded the questionsin their glances; I had what I wanted They began calling up the witnesses First  the doctor who had certified Ambassador Cumshaws death  He gavea concise description of the wounds which had killed my predecessor Sidney was trying to make something out of the fact that he wasHickocks family physician  and consuming more time  when I got up Judge Nelson rapped sharply  He nodded to me  
 It was  so I turned to the witness  
He chuckled  I picked up the 20-mm auto-rifle--it weighed a good sixty pounds--fromthe table  and asked him if this weapon could have inflicted suchwounds  He agreed that it both could and had I asked the same question when I cross-examined the ballistics witness  I remarked  
That  of course  brought Sidney to his feet  sputtering objections tothis attempt to disparage the honest poverty of his clients  which onlyhelped to call attention to the point Then the prosecution called in a witness named David CrockettLongfellow  Id met him at the Hickock ranch; he was Hickocks butler He limped from an old injury which had retired him from work on therange  He was sworn in and testified to his name and occupation replied Sidney was up at once  shouting objections  After he was quieted down Goodham remarked that hed come to that point later  and began a line ofquestioning to establish that Longfellow had been on the Hickock ranchon the day when Silas Cumshaw was killed  Goodham said  
Longfellow began his story  Little single-seat job that he drove himself  He landed it about ahundred feet from the outside veranda  like he usually did  and got out Goodham waited a few moments  Longfellows voice had choked and therewas a twitching about his face  as though he were trying to suppresstears  Goodham said  
 He looked at Jack-High in coldly poisonous hatred  
Further questioning revealed that Longfellow had had no direct knowledgeof the pursuit  or the siege of the jail in Bonneyville  Colonel Hickockhad taken personal command of that  and had left Longfellow behind tocall the Solar League Embassy and the Rangers  He had made no attempt tomove the body  but had left it lying in the driveway until the doctorand the Rangers arrived Goodham went to the middle table and picked up a heavy automatic pistol to Longfellow  Longfellow was almost insulted by the question  Of course he knew hisown pistol  He recited the serial number  and pointed to different scarsand scratches on the weapon  telling how they had been acquired said  It was  although Longfellow resented the qualification Sidney began an immediate attack Questioning Longfellows eyesight  intelligence  honesty and integrity he tried to show personal enmity toward the Bonneys  He implied thatLongfellow had been conspiring with Cumshaw to bring about the conquestof New Texas by the Solar League  The verbal exchange became so heatedthat both witness and attorney had to be admonished repeatedly from thebench  But at no point did Sidney shake Longfellow from his onefundamental statement  that the Bonney brothers had shot Silas Cumshawand that he had shot Jack-High Abe Bonney in the shoulder When he was finished  I got up and took over  I began  
Nobody  But the aircar had obviously been waiting for Mr  Cumshaw; theBonneys must have had advance knowledge  My questions made that pointclear despite the obvious--and reluctantly court-sustained--objectionsfrom Mr  Sidney There being none  Longfellow stepped down  It was then a few minutesbefore noon  so Judge Nelson recessed court for an hour and a half In the afternoon  the surgeon who had treated Jack-High Abe Bonneyswounded shoulder testified  identifying the bullet which had beenextracted from Bonneys shoulder  A ballistics man from Ranger crime-labfollowed him to the stand and testified that it had been fired fromLongfellows Colt  Then Ranger Captain Nelson took the stand  Histestimony was about what he had given me at the Embassy  with theexception that the Bonneys admission that they had shot AmbassadorCumshaw was ruled out as having been made under duress However  Captain Nelsons testimony didnt need the confessions The cover was stripped off the air-car  and a couple of men with apower-dolly dragged it out in front of the bench  The Ranger Captainidentified it as the car which he had found at the Bonneyville jail  Hewent over it with an ultra-violet flashlight and showed where he hadwritten his name and the date on it with fluorescent ink  The effects ofAA-fire were plainly evident on it Then the other shrouded object was unveiled and identified as the gunwhich had disabled the air-car  Colonel Hickock identified the gun asthe one with which he had fired on the air-car  Finally  the ballisticsexpert was brought back to the stand again  to link the two by means offragments found in the car Then Goodham brought Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney to the stand The Mayor of Bonneyville was a man of fifty or so  short  partiallybald  dressed in faded blue Levis  a frayed white shirt  and agrease-spotted vest  There was absolutely no mystery about how he hadacquired his nickname  He disgorged a cud of tobacco into a spittoon took the oath with unctuous solemnity  then reloaded himself withanother chew and told his version of the attack on the jail At about 1045 on the day in question  he testified  he had been in hisoffice  hard at work in the public service  when an air-car  partiallydisabled by gunfire  had landed in the street outside and the threedefendants had rushed in  claiming sanctuary  From then on  the storyflowed along smoothly  following the lines predicted by Captain Nelsonand Parros  Of course he had given the fugitives shelter; they hadclaimed to have been near to a political assassination and were in fearof their lives Under Sidneys cross-examination  and coaching  he poured out the storyof Bonneyvilles wrongs at the hands of the reactionary landowners  andthe atrocious behavior of the Hickock goon-gang  Finally  afterextracting the last drop of class-hatred venom out of him  Sidney turnedhim over to me He couldnt rightly say  maybe four or five It took a good five minutes before Sidney stopped shouting long enoughfor Judge Nelson to sustain the objection Kettle-Belly Sam didnt answer pressing  out about half as far as his midriff   I replied to the voice  
turned to the witness  As Bonney left the stand and was led out the side door  Goodhamaddressed the bench  he said  
Followed a long succession of witnesses  each testifying to some publicor private act of philanthropy  some noble trait of character  It wasthe sort of thing which the defense lawyer in the Whately case had beenso willing to stipulate  Sidney  of course  tried to make it all out tobe part of a sinister conspiracy to establish a Solar League fifthcolumn on New Texas  Finally  the prosecution rested its case I entertained Gail and her father at the Embassy  that evening  Thestreet outside was crowded with New Texans  all of them on our side shouting slogans like   and 
 and 
too  The Hickocks  father and daughter  were given a tremendous ovation when they finally left  and followed to their hotel by cheering crowds I saw one big banner  lettered: DONT LET NEW TEXAS GO TO THE DOGS and bearing a crude picture of a zSrauff  I seemed to recall havingseen a couple of our Marines making that banner the evening before inthe Embassy patio  but    CHAPTER XThe next morning  the third of the trial  opened with the defensewitnesses  character-witnesses for the three killers and witnesses tothe political iniquities of Silas Cumshaw Neither Goodham nor I bothered to cross-examine the former  I couldntsee how any lawyer as shrewd as Sidney had shown himself to be wouldeven dream of getting such an array of thugs  cutthroats  sluts andslatterns into court as character witnesses for anybody The latter  on the other hand  we went after unmercifully  revealing under their enmity for Cumshaw  a small  hard core of bigoted xenophobiaand selfish fear  Goodham did a beautiful job on that; he seemed able at a glance  to divine exactly what each witnesss motivation was  andable to make him or her betray that motivation in its least admirableterms  Finally the defense rested  about a quarter-hour before noon I rose and addressed the court:Sidney  who had begun shouting objections as soon as I had gotten to myfeet  finally managed to get himself recognized by the court  Judge Nelson said  
 He glanced at his watch  
I assured him I could after glancing across the room at Ranger CaptainNelson and catching his nod My first witness  that afternoon was Thrombley  After the formalities ofgetting his name and connection with the Solar League Embassy on therecord  I asked him   Thrombley said he had  
sweeping glance  Sidney got up  started toward the witness stand  and then thought betterof it The next witness was a Mr  James Finnegan; he was identified as cashierof the Crooked Creek National Bank  I asked him if Kettle-Belly SamBonney did business at his bank; he said yes Kettle-Belly  This time  there was no letter; just one of our regulardeposit-slips  No name of depositor  I held the check  and gave it toKettle-Belly  I remember  when it came in  I said to one of the clerks Well  I wonder whos going to get bumped off this time  And sureenough    Objection!
English  was apparently taken away by Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney  If yousaw another letter of the same sort  would you be able to say whether ornot it might be like the one you mentionedNot at all  Mr  Sidney 
if Mr  Finnegan could say whether one document bore any resemblance toanother And whose account received this anonymous benefaction  Mr  Boone
The account 
of Mr  Clement Sidney 
I cant pronounce this-here thing  at all 
Your Honor  how am I gonna go about swearing him in

Service  before I was sent here  We use Basic with a great many alienpeoples Administer the oath  then

now What money did they give you for the machine
One hundred pesos 
Mr  Ambassador 
in the used-car business  Am I expected to believe that this     thisbeing     sold that air-car for a hundred pesosVehicles Registration Bureau I introduce it as evidence

No further questions 
And what business did you make with them
twenty-millimeters very fast  to make death or hurt come to men andanimals and does destruction to machines and things Is this the gun
there  I am certain that this is the very gun How much money did these three persons give you for this gun
Five pesos 
The customs appraisal on this gun is six hundred pesos 
as part of his knowledge that he may put himself in trouble by what hesays to answer these questions That is all  Your Honor 
And now 
court  speaking both as amicus curiae and as Ambassador of the SolarLeague  This court cannot convict the three men who are here on trial These men should have never been brought to trial in this court: it hasno jurisdiction over this case  This was a simple case of first-degreemurder  by hired assassins  committed against the Ambassador of onegovernment at the instigation of another  not an act of politicalprotest within the meaning of New Texan law statement you have just made Gladly  Your Honor 
protection to persons engaged in the practice of politics  An act ofpersonal injury against a politician is considered criminal only to theextent that the politician injured has not  by his public acts  deservedthe degree of severity with which he has been injured  and the Court ofPolitical Justice is established for the purpose of determining whetheror not there has been such an excess of severity in the treatment metedout by the accused to the injured or deceased politician  This givesrise  of course  to some interesting practices; for instance  what is atlaw a trial of the accused is  in substance  a trial of his victim  Butin any case tried in this court  the accused must be a person who hasinjured or killed a man who is definable as a practicing politicianunder the government of New Texas  Judge Nelson said gravely  
 I said  
government of New Texas  My government now knows who procured the deathof Silas Cumshaw  and we will take appropriate action  The governmentof New Texas has now had spelled out  in letters anyone can read  thefact that this beautiful planet is in truth a battleground  Awarenessof this may save New Texas from being the scene of a larger and moredestructive battle  New Texas also knows who are its enemies  and whocan be counted upon to stand as its friends comment Well  well have to close the court  to consider this phase ofthe question Stephen! How could you
Youve gotten those murdering snakes turned loose!of my best friends!one of my instructors at Dumbarton Oaks  and I have always had thedeepest respect and admiration for him  But he taught me one thing which you seem to have forgotten since you expatriated yourself--thatin the Diplomatic Service  personal feelings dont count  The onlything of importance is the advancement of the policies of the SolarLeague Altair II Bonney  together with your counsel  approach the court and hear theverdict It pains me inexpressibly 
that this court cannot convict you of the cowardly murder of thatlearned and honorable old man  Silas Cumshaw  nor can you be brought totrial in any other court on New Texas again for that dastardly crime Here are your weapons  which must be returned to you  Sort them outyourselves  because I wont dirty my fingers on them  And may you regretand feel shame for your despicable act as long as you live  which I hopewont be more than a few hours There!
go up and congratulate him  tooIn about two minutes 
or weep over my corpse  Right now  though  youd better be gettingbehind something solid Hold it!
politician  but you still have killing a Solar League Ambassador toanswer for  Now get your hands full of guns  if you dont want to diewith them empty!adjourned-reconvene-0900-tomorrow  Hit the floor!Damn! He means it!
Your Honor 
court turned into a shooting gallery  I can assure you  however  that myaction here was not the result of any lack of respect for this court  Itwas pure necessity  Your Honor can see that: my government could notpermit this crime against its Ambassador to pass unpunished incident happened  Mr  Silk my unofficial and personal comments here as establishing any legalprecedent  and I wouldnt like to see this sort of thing becomecustomary     but     you did that all by yourself  with those littlebeanshooters    Not bad  not bad at all  Mr  Silk Look  Fido 
source from which the orders for the murder of my predecessor came These men I just killed were only the tools That  of course  was not exactly striped-pants diplomatic language  Iwondered  for a moment  what Norman Gazarian  the protocol man  wouldthink if he heard an Ambassador calling another Ambassador Fido But it seemed to be the kind of language that Mr  Vuvuvu understood  Heskinned back his upper lip at me and began snarling and growling  Thenhe turned on his hind paws and padded angrily down the aisle away fromthe front of the courtroom The spectators around him and above him began barking  baying  yelpingat him:

get the hell outa here We shall have to give up  Gregory 
Why  Anthony
Look  Another typical reaction; retreat to the foetus 
send him back And look for no more
I will never give up!
Anthony!
That means nothing 
cortico-thalamic integration I want to believe it  but Im afraid to 
Just who are you people
just where am IIve dreamed of the day when I could say this!
Congratulations  Gregory!
I believe I asked a couple of questions 
mutual admiration session  but I would appreciate some answers  Thisisnt anything like the situation I last remember    He remembers!
by symbolic logic  and it strengthens the validity of the second    Save that for later  Paula 
your theories about why memories are unimpaired when you time-jumpforward and lost when you reverse the process  but lets stick tobusiness  We have what we wanted; now lets use what we have I never liked the way you made your money 
but when you talk  it makes sense  Lets get on with it 
I believe you had better    
question  Where am I that will have to be rephrased  If you ask When and where am I I can furnish a rational answer  In the temporaldimension  you are fifty years futureward of the day of your death;spatially  you are about eight thousand miles from the place of yourdeath  in what is now the World Capitol  St  Louis team  but I didnt think it was that good No  no 
At least not yet  But if The Guide keeps on insisting that onlybeautiful things are good and that he is uniquely qualified to definebeauty  watch his rule change into just that delusions  about his public statements    Idolatry!
in spirit!I made a joke 
of you got it has done more to prove that I am fifty years in the futurethan anything any of you could say Yes; I remember! Baseball!
now  The Guide will not allow competitive sports; he says that theyfoster the spirit of violence    You probably know more history than any of us 
Suppose you tell him what the score is 
interpretations strictly capitalist  of course You first  Gregory 
how he got here  and then Ill tell him why I believe 
some use of the subject of time-travel  It was not  however  givenserious consideration  largely because of certain alleged paradoxesinvolved  and because of an elementalistic and objectifying attitudetoward the whole subject of time  I wont go into the mathematics andsymbolic logic involved  but we have disposed of the objections; more we have succeeded in constructing a time-machine  if you want to call itthat  We prefer to call it a temporal-spatial displacement fieldgenerator Its really very simple 
universe is expanding  time is a widening spiral; if contracting  adiminishing spiral; if static  a uniform spiral  The possibility ofpulsation was our only worry    Thats no worry 
too slow to have an effect on    microsecond  but where is the instrument to measure a temporal pulsationthat may require years    You havent come to that yet Be quiet  both of you!
converted to the godlessness of The Guide  and other thousands of hisdupes are dying  unprepared to face their Maker!All right  you invented a time-machine 
was only a high school chemistry teacher  I can tell a class of juniorsthe difference between H{2}O and H{2}SO{4}  but the theory oftime-travel is wasted on me     Suppose you just let me ask thequestions; then Ill be sure of finding out what I dont know  Forinstance  who won the war I was fighting in  before you grabbed me andbrought me here The CommiesNo  the United Nations 
least exhausted when both sides decided to quit Then whats this dictatorship     The Guide Extreme Rightist
Walter  youd better tell him 
We damn near lost the war 
broken up--India  China  Indonesia  Mongolia  Russia  the Ukraine  allthe Satellite States  Most of them turned into little dictatorships like the Latin American countries after the liberation from Spain  butthey were personal  non-ideological  generally benevolent dictatorships  the kind that can grow into democracies  if theyre giventime Capitalistic dictatorships  he means 
Be quiet  Carl 
class-struggle stuff Actually  the United Nations rules the world 
goes on in the Ukraine or Latvia or Manchuria is about analogous to whatwent on under the old United States government in  lets say Tammany-ruled New York  But heres the catch  The UN is ruled absolutelyby one man subdivided and compartmented that it couldnt even run a war properly Our army commanders were making war by systematic disobedience The charter was changed shortly after     er  that is  after    
After my death 
charter  how did one man get all the powers into his handsBy sorcery!
his master  Satan!You know  there are times when some such theory tempts me 
He was a big moneybags 
York was bombed flat  Where the old UN buildings were  its still hot So The Guide donated a big tract of land outside St  Louis  built thesebuildings--were in the basement of one of them  right now  if you wanta good laugh--and before long  he had the whole organization eating outof his hand  They just voted him into power  and the world intoslavery altruism  integrity and wisdom blasphemous to say anything against him  I really dont understand howit happened    Well  whats he been doing with his power
or stupid onespolitical and other liberties  It is best to be specific Gregory
yet  Its different in other fields  For instance  all research insonics has been arbitrarily stopped  So has a great deal of work inorganic and synthetic chemistry  Psychology is a madhouse of     whatwas the old word  licentiousness No  lysenkoism  Medicine andsurgery--well  theres a huge program of compulsory sterilization  andanother one of eugenic marriage-control  And infants who dont conformto certain physical standards dont survive  Neither do people who havedisfiguring accidents beyond the power of plastic surgery you an audio-visual of an interesting ceremony in a Hindu village derived from the ancient custom of the suttee  It is the Hindu method ofconforming to The Guides demand that only beautiful children be allowedto grow to maturity and in Europe We have lethal-gas chambers that even Hitler would have envied 
I am a musician 
sciences are controlled  he should try to write even the simplest pieceof music  The extent of censorship and control over all the arts  andespecially music  is incredible another motive  a more selfish one  I am approaching the compulsoryretirement age; I will soon be invited to go to one of the Havens  Eventhough these Havens are located in the most barren places  they arebeauty-spots  verdant beyond belief  It is of only passing interestthat  while large numbers of the aged go there yearly  their populationsremain constant  and  to judge from the quantities of supplies shippedto them  extremely small They call me Samuel  in this organization 
here in an effort to live up to it  Although I am ordained by no church I fight for all of them  The plain fact is that this man we call TheGuide is really the Antichrist!me willing to finance this project Guide wont let people make money  and if they do  he taxes it away fromthem  And he has laws to prohibit inheritance; what little you canaccumulate  you cant pass on to your children I put up a lot of the money  too  dont forget 
Union did; Im a poor man  myself working man in North America  Europe  Australia and South Africa belongsto it  And The Guide has us all hog-tied He wont let you strike 
closed-shop contracts stick  And as far as getting anything like apay-raise    them  the way The Guide has us under his thumb    you two realize that youre both on the same side  and that what hurtsone hurts both neither Labor nor Management had learned that the enemies hes made on the UN Capitol grounds  In fact  except for a small police-force armed only with non-lethal stun-guns  your profession of arms isnon-existent Ive been guessing what you want me to do 
Guide bumped off  But why cant any of you do it Or  if its too risky at least somebody from your own time Why meespecially the taking of human life Now  wait a moment!
you showed me werent dying of old age    That is not violence 
beneficence  Ugly people would be unhappy  and would make othersunhappy  in a world where everybody else is beautiful And all these oppressive and tyrannical laws 
does he enforce them  without violence  actual or threatenedknow music has something to do with it  because there is always music everywhere  This laboratory  for instance  was secretly soundproofed; wecouldnt have worked here  otherwise a soldier  whose conditioning has been in favor rather than againstviolence  Im not the only one you snatched  I take itover the world and all over history them could adjust     Uggh!Hes thinking 
blew out his brains with a pocket-pistol on that table  and an Englisharcher from Agincourt who ran amok with a dagger in here  and a trooperof the Seventh Cavalry from the Custer Massacre take our subjects largely at random with regard to individualcharacteristics  mental attitudes  adaptability  et cetera from their professional lack of repugnance for violence  we tooksoldiers from battlefields because we could select men facing immediatedeath  whose removal from the past would not have any effect upon thecasual chain of events affecting the present I can see that 
the past  That was always one of the favorite paradoxes in time-travelfiction     Well  I think I have the general picture  You have adictator who is tyrannizing you; you want to get rid of him; you cantkill him yourselves  Im opposed to dictators  myself; that--and theSelective Service law  of course--was why I was a soldier  I have nomoral or psychological taboos against killing dictators  or anybodyelse  Suppose I cooperate with you; whats in it for meYour return to your own time and place 
And if I dont cooperate with you
Guess when and where else we could send you 
Exactly the same time and place
Well  the structure of space-time demands    
spot--coordinates in the universe  However  to avoid disruption of thestructure of space-time  we must return you to approximately the samepoint in space-time All right; tell me exactly what you want me to do 
Shut up  all of you!
I worked this out  so let me tell it 
tougher than the rest of them  or maybe Im not as deeply conditioned For one thing  Im tone-deaf  Well  heres the way it is  Gregory canset the machine to function automatically  You stand where he shows you press the button he shows you  and fifteen seconds later itll take youforward in time five seconds and about a kilometer in space  to TheGuides office  Hell be at his desk now  Youll have forty-five secondsto do the job  from the time the field collapses around you till itrebuilds  Then youll be taken back to your own time again  The wholethings automatic Can do 
How do I kill him
Im getting sick!
Take care of her  Samuel  Both of youd better get out of here 
The Lord of Hosts is my strength  He will     Uggggh!
Conditionings getting him  too; we gotta be quick 
This is what youll use it  and get it out of your hand fast    bomb; everything within two-meter circle burned to nothing; outsidethat  great but not unendurable heat  Shut your eyes when you throw it Flash almost blinding Walter Peculiar sort of thing for a non-violent people to manufacture 
them  in Walters iron mines Where do I stand  now
Right over here 
circle and stand perfectly still while the field builds up andcollapses  Face that way Put that horrid thing out of sight!
thing     is what you want to use field re-builds He has no guards  He lives absolutely alone  We told you    
youre sending me forward  What do you do about the fact that atime-jump seems to make me pass outHere  Before you press the button  swallow it 
Well  I guess thats all there is 
I hope    
Conditioning got him  Getting me  too 
Hurry up  man!
Joe! You no shoot  me no shoot!Captain Benson We were warned to be on watch for your patrol 
Any of the rest of you lads get out
couple of them  Some are locals and dont speak very good English  Ivegot to get back to Division  myself; whats the best waydont mind going slowly  theyll show you the way to advance dressingstation  and you can hitch a ride on an ambulance from there Hey  Joe! Hey  Joe!

I was hoping somebodyd show up    
Bring home any souvenirs
remember what all; havent gotten around to unpacking them  yet     Ihave a sixth of rye and some beer  at my rooms  Lets go around and seewhat I did bring home What the devils that
Bill  I dont know 
on my way back from my last hunter patrol     Ive never told anybodyabout this  before some honeys picked that thing up in some other way  deliberately forgotten thecircumstances  and fabricated this story about the tank and the grenadeand the discrepancy in your watch subconsciously as an explanationMy subconscious is a better liar than that 
would have cobbled up some kind of a story that would stand up  Thisbusiness    Top Secret! For the Guide Only!
marks  and if it were Soviet  itd be tri-lingual  Russian  Hindi andChinese having some of the nastiest dreams  lately    Well  be careful; it may be booby-trapped 
Dont worry; I will 
Theres a lot of this stuff I dont dig 
rigamarole about The Guide  Im going to get to work on this sample inthe lab  at school  though  Maybe we have something  here We do have something  Bill 
to give our income-tax experts headaches You have 
Where do you start fitting me into it
people  Youre a psychologist  A real one; not one of these night-schoolboys  A juvenile psychologist  too  And what age-group spends the mostmoney in this country for soft-drinksNot a bit of difference  Fred 
We have it!
Hey!
that thing I never heard you play as well as that!I dont know 
much money practicing as a psychiatrist  these days  The whole worldseems to be going pure  unadulterated nuts! That affair in Munich  forinstance Yes 
Germany  too    Bill! You remember those sheets of onion-skin in that envelope
that     Fred!heightened psycho-physiological effects  that we were never ableto understand!mass-hysteria--that baseball-game riot in Baltimore; the time everybodystarted tearing off each others clothes in Milwaukee; the sex-orgy inNew Orleans  And the sharp uptrend in individual psycho-neurotic andpsychotic behavior  All in connection with music  too  and all afterEvri-Flave got on the market Well have to stop it; pull Evri-Flave off the market 
cant be responsible for letting this go on hands of jobbers and distributors over whom we have no control  And wehave all these contractual obligations  to buy the entire output of thecompanies that make the syrup for us; if we stop buying  they can sellit in competition with us  as long as they dont infringe ourtrade-name  And we cant prevent pirating  You know how easily we wereable to duplicate that sample I brought back from Turkey  Why  our legaldepartments kept busy all the time prosecuting unlicensed manufacturersas it is Weve got to do something  Fred!
you and I  like the old times at Eisenhower High  First  we want tobe sure that Evri-Flave really is responsible  Itd be a hell of athing if we started a public panic against our own product for nothing And then    Thats how it happened  then 
result of all that Götterdämmerung music  There was a band at thebaseball park in Baltimore  The New Orleans Orgy started while a localradio station was broadcasting some of this new dance-music  Look  thesetone-clusters  here  have a definite sex-excitation effect  This seriesof six chords  which occur in some of the Wagnerian stuff; effect  acombined feeling of godlike isolation and despair  And these consecutivefifths--a sense of danger  anger  combativeness  You know  we could workout a whole range of emotional stimuli to fit the effects of IngredientBeta    We dont want to 
Beta that will keep the flavor of the drink without thepsycho-physiological effects Gave them a lot of syrup without Beta  and told them to work out cheapadditives to restore the regular Evri-Flave taste; told them it was aneffort to find a cheap substitute for an expensive ingredient  But look Bill  You and I both see  for instance  that a powerful world-widesupra-national sovereignty is the only guarantee of world peace  If wecould use something like this to help overcome antiquated verbalprejudices and nationalistic emotional attachments    No!
even in a cause like world peace; use a thing like this for a good almost holy  cause now  and tomorrow we  or those who would come afterus  would be using it to create a tyranny  You know what year this is BillWhy  1984 
forty years ago Well  thats a picture of the kind of world youd have eventually  no matter what kind of a world you started out to make Fred  dont ever think of using this stuff for a purpose like that  Ifyou try it  Ill fight you with every resource I have Hey  Joe! Hey  Joe!
even trust the UN with a thing like this  It makes the H-bomb look likea stone hatchet     Well  Ill call Grant  at the plant lab  and see howhis boys are coming along with the substitute; as soon as we get it  wecan put out a confidential letter to all our distributors andsyrup-manufacturers

No  Zarvas Pol 
time-machine was sabotaged So By you
Hradzka was not content with having enslaved a whole Solar System: hehungered to bring tyranny and serfdom to all the past and all the futureas well; he wanted to be master not only of the present but of thecenturies that were and were to be  as well  I never took part inpolitics  Zarvas Pol; I had no hand in this revolt  But I could not beparty to such a crime as Hradzka contemplated when it lay within mypower to prevent it time when this planet was a swirling cloud of flaming gasthat  It will only take him about ten thousand years into the past  Butthen  when it stops  the machine will destroy itself  It may destroyHradzka with it or he may escape  But if he does  he will be leftstranded ten thousand years ago  when he can do us no harm  Zarvas Pol objected  
apparently changing the subject  Kradzy Zago asked: General Zarvas smiled         *       *       *       *       *The old one smiled wanly   the soldier commented

him Miss Kourtakides merely told me that hed been injured and was in ahospital in Pittsburgh The Herr Doktor got shot

Ordinary intelligence-testing wont be enough  The woman I was speakingof has an I Q  well inside the meaning of normal intelligence  She justdoesnt use it Sure

of unsound mind  deficient mentality or emotional instability  unquote It says so right in our union contract  in nice big print Then theyll claim the tests are wrong 
I cant see how they can do that 
Neither can I  and they probably wont either 
theyll go ahead and do it  Why  Scott  theyre pulling the Number OneDoernberg-Giardano  tonight  By oh-eight-hundred  it ought to be coolenough to work on  Where will we hold the tests HereWell have to  unless we can get Dr  Rives security-cleared

fifty of my own men  from Pittsburgh  here  but they cant work on thereactors because they dont belong to the Industrial Federation ofAtomic Workers  and I cant just pay their initiation fees and uniondues and get union cards for them  because admission to this union is onan annual quota basis  and this is December  and the quotas full  So Ihave to use them outside the reactor area  on fabrication and assemblywork  And I have to hire through the union  and thats handled on amembership seniority basis  so I have to take whats thrown at me Thats why I was careful to get that clause I was quoting to Sid writteninto my contract asked  Melroy replied  
Dr  Doris Rives lifted a delicately penciled eyebrow over that  Melroy pausing to relight his pipe  grinned at her  he asked

Is there a recorder going on this line
Naturally 
office routine your employ to submit to some kind of a mental test  Is that correctagainst his will  If anybody objects to taking these tests  he can sayso  and Ill have his time made out and pay him off men want to keep their jobs theyll have to take this test Well  thats stated more or less correctly 
just put it that taking--and passing--this test is a condition ofemployment  My contract with your union recognizes my right to establishstandards of intelligence; thats implied by my recognized right todismiss any person of unsound mind  deficient mentality or emotionalinstability  Psychological testing is the only means of determiningwhether or not a person is classifiable in those terms say  mentally deficient  you intend dismissing himWith the customary two weeks severance-pay  yes 
to insist on reviewing the grounds for dismissal review being reserved by the union in such cases  Only in cases ofdisciplinary dismissal  which this is not  I take the position thatcertain minimum standards of intelligence and mental stability areessentials in this sort of work  just as  say  certain minimum standardsof literacy are essential in clerical work arewill be dropped from my payroll passed these testsYou
tests are being given  and will be evaluated  by a graduatepsychologist  Dr  D  Warren Rives  who has a diploma from the AmericanBoard of Psychiatry and Neurology and is a member of the AmericanPsychological Association  Dr  Rives will be the final arbiter on who isor is not disqualified by these tests Well  our man Koffler says you have some girl there to give the tests 
I suppose he means Dr  Rives 
is an extremely competent psychologist  however  She came to me mosthighly recommended by Dr  Karl von Heydenreich  who is not inclined tobe careless with his recommendations to have dismissals which occur as a result of these tests signed with me  Get a qualified lawyer to tell you what weve agreed toand what we havent  Was there anything else you wanted to talkabout    No    Then good morning  Mr  Crandall All right; lets get on with it 
them into the lunch room; there are enough tables and benches in therefor everybody to take the written test in two relays The unions gotta be represented while these tests is going on 
what you do to these guys This man working for us
Yes  Koffler  Julius  Electrical fitter; Joe Riccis gang 
written test  and gets first turn for the orals  That way he can spendthe rest of his time on duty here for the union  and will know inadvance what the test is like this  You keep your mouth out of it  If you see anything that looksobjectionable  make a note of it  but dont try to interfere tanks  and a couple of thousand soldiers and cops and undercover-men here  guarding against sabotage  Dont you realize that a workman whomakes stupid or careless or impulsive mistakes is just as dangerous tothe plant as any saboteur If somebody shoots you through the head  itdoesnt matter whether he planned to murder you for a year or justdidnt know the gun was loaded; youre as dead one way as the other  Ishould think youd thank me for trying to eliminate a serious source ofdanger Now  dont misunderstand my position  Mr  Melroy 
people are going to make trouble cybernetic system for you; you arent responsible for my labor policy yourselfHave I had--!
personnel  here; that makes me his top-priority target  all the time the I F A W   my lawyer and their lawyer handled everything; I nevereven met him Well--He has his job to do  the same as I have 
does it conscientiously  But its like this--anything a workman tellshim is the truth  and anything an employer tells him is a dirty lie Until proven differently  of course  but that takes a lot of doing  Andhe goes off half-cocked a lot of times  He doesnt stop to analyzesituations very closely control over my labor relations  Tell him to bring his gripes to me tests and interviews completed results  though  I wonder if theres a vacant desk around here anywhere  and a record player And if youre going to be working late  Ill order some dinner for youfrom the cafeteria  Im going to be here all evening  myself I dont think they got everything out of that reactor 
REMs--and the temperatures away up  too  That isnt lingeringradiation; thats prompt radiation Radioactivity hasnt dropped since morning; Id think so  too 
What are they getting on the breakdown counter
maintenance boss; he doesnt like it  either Well  Im no nuclear physicist 
stuff looks like a big chunk of Pu-239 left inside  Whats Fred doingabout itremote-control equipment  When I left  he had a gang pulling outgraphite blocks with RC-tongs  We probably wont get a chance to work onit much before thirteen-hundred tomorrow still have this stuff to get straightened out  too three dinners  Dr  Rives is eating here  too  Find out what she wants; Iwant pork chops Uh-huh; Lil Abner Melroy; pok chops unless otherwise specified 
Howd the finished tests come out
Better than Id expected  Only two washouts 
Burris and Julius Koffler Oh  no!
loudest-mouthed I-know-my-rights boy on the job!Well  wasnt that to be expected
those two put on--ability and judgment problem-child show-off type  and Burris is an almost perfecttwelve-year-old schoolyard bully  They both have inferiority complexeslong enough to step on  If the purpose of this test is what Im led tobelieve it is  I cant  in professional good conscience  recommendanything but that you get rid of both of them the best show of plausibility  that the test is just a pretext to firethem for union activities theyre the only ones theyll have company No  I cant do that 
the test was solely for ability to reason logically  Just among thethree of us  I know some university professors whod flunk on that  Butif the rest of the tests show stability  sense of responsibility  goodjudgment  and a tendency to think before acting  the subject can beclassified as a safe and reliable workman finished No!
chance they may do something disastrous  Ill fire them atoh-eight-hundred tomorrow All right 
didnt warn you Theyre here at my office 
them  and hear recordings of the oral portions of the tests  But Idadvise you to bring a professional psychologist along  because unlessyoure a trained psychologist yourself  theyre not likely to mean muchto you Oh  sure!
ordinary people  or you couldnt get away with this frame-up! Well dont worry  Ill be along to see them I F A W  Well  frankly  so am I 
play Hatfields and McCoys with this union  Ive had union troublebefore  and it isnt fun  Youre the gentleman who called me lastevening  arent you Then you understand my position in the matter officer  last evening  He agrees that a stupid or careless workman is under some circumstances  a more serious threat to security than anysaboteur  And we realize fully how dangerous those Doernberg-Giardanosare  and how much more dangerous theyd be if these cybernetic controlswere improperly assembled  But this man Crandall is talking aboutcalling a strike Atomic Power Authority  And  in the second place  if he does and it goesto Federal mediation  his demand for the reinstatement of those men willbe thrown out  and his own organization will have to disavow his action because hell be calling the strike against his own contract Well  I hope so 
I wish you luck; youre going to need it 
Mr  Melroy  were not going to stand for this 
getting rid of Mr  Koffler and Mr  Burris because of their legitimateunion activities Who gave you that idea
Koffler and Burris
Thats the complaint they made to me  and its borne out by the facts 
that Mr  Koffler has made to us about different unfair work-assignments improper working conditions  inequities in allotting overtime work  andother infractions of union-shop conditions  on behalf of Mr  Burris  Soyou decided to get rid of both of them  and you think you can use thisclause in our contract with your company about persons of deficientintelligence  The fact is  youre known to have threatened on severaloccasions to get rid of both of them I am
those people tell you  Well  they lied to you if they told you that Naturally thats what youd say 
account for the fact that those two men  and only those two men  weredismissed for alleged deficient intelligenceThe tests arent all made 
say that they are the only ones disqualified  And if you look over therecords of the tests  youll see where Koffler and Burris failed and theothers passed  Here Burris; these are the ones of the men who passed the test  Look themover if you want to Why  this stuffs a lot of gibberish!
thing  here:     five Limerick oysters  six pairs of Don Alfonsotweezers  seven hundred Macedonian warriors in full battle array  eightgolden crowns from the ancient  secret crypts of Egypt  nine lymphatic sympathetic  peripatetic old men on crutches  and ten revolvingheliotropes from the Ipsy-Wipsy Institute! Great Lord  do you actuallymean that youre using this stuff as an excuse for depriving men oftheir jobsalong Burris to repeat their complaints on a lie-detector  while youre at it They took the same tests  in the same manner  as any of the others  Theyjust didnt have the mental equipment to cope with them and the othersdid  And for that reason  I wont run the risk of having them working onthis job Thats just your word against theirs 
them morning Thats not the way they tell it 
Keating have been out to get them ever since they were hired  You andyour supervisors have been persecuting both of those men systematically The fact that Burris has had grounds for all these previous complaintsproves that credulous enough to believe him confirm the results of the tests they failed to pass he has a persecution complex if he recognizes the fact  Well  youre notgoing to get away with it  thats all I have to say to you not worth the paper its scribbled on!They walked out on us 
talking to them  and at noon the whole gang handed in theirwrist-Geigers and dosimeters and cleared out their lockers  They saythey arent coming back till Burris and Koffler come back to work withthem Then they arent coming back  period 
see me  a couple of hours ago  He tells me that Burris and Koffler toldhim that weve been persecuting Burris; discriminating against him  Youknow of anything that really happened that might make them thinkanything like thatbut you know how it is: hes just a roustabout  a common laborer  Anyovertime work that has to be done is usually skilled labor on this job We generally have a few roustabouts to help out  but hes been allowedto make overtime as much as any of the others Will the time-records show that
whatever it was  Ill bet they were lying Thats all right  then  Hows the reactor  now
down to inactive normal  He and his gang found a big chunk of plutonium about one-quarter CM  inside  He got it out completed test records and come out to the office  You and the othersstay on the job; we may have some men for you by this afternoon;tomorrow morning certainly Joan  is Sid Keating out there Send him in  will you
All right  Cassandra 
didnt warn me  Look  This strike is illegal  Its a violation of theFederal Labor Act of 1958  being called without due notice of intention without preliminary negotiation  and without two weeks time-allowance a spontaneous work-stoppage every one of those men for leaving their work without permission andabsence from duty without leave  How many of our own men  fromPittsburgh  do we have working in these machine shops and in theassembly shop here About sixtyare youthis work better than this gang weve had to hire here  Just to be onthe safe side  Im promoting all of them  as of oh-eight-hundred thismorning  to assistant gang-foremen  on salaries  Thatll take themoutside union jurisdiction But how about our contract with the I F A W 
execution of our contract with the Atomic Power Authority  You know whatI think I think the I F A W  front office is going to have to disavowthis  Itll hurt them to do it  but theyll have to  Crandalls put themin the middle on this How about security clearance for our own men
Nothing to that 
already  from the work we did installing that counter-rocket controlsystem on the U S S  Alaska  and the work we did on thatsymbolic-logic computer for the Philadelphia Project  It may take allday to get the red tape unwound  but I think we can be ready to start byoh-eight-hundred tomorrow Melroy  what are you trying to do
shot-stung bobcat  They claim youre going to bring in strike-breakers;theyre talking about picketing the whole reactor area News gets around fast  here  doesnt it
that would meanthe whole thing will go to mediation and get aired  which is what Iwant  or theyll pull a Pearl Harbor on you  the way they did on me  Andin that case  the President will have to intervene  and theyll fly intechnicians from some of the Armed Forces plants to keep this placerunning  And in that case  thingsll get settled that much quicker  ThisCrandall thinks these men I fired are martyrs  and hes preaching acrusade  He ought to carry an advocatus diaboli on his payroll  toscrutinize the qualifications of his martyrs  before he startscanonizing them I have twelve more tests completed 
Only one washout 
Doctor  theyre all washed out 
there was an additional test  and they all flunked it  Evincedwillingness to follow unwise leadership and allow themselves to betalked into improper courses of action  You go on in to New York  andtake all the test-material  including sound records  with you  Stay atthe hotel--your pay will go on--till I need you  Therell be a FederalMediation hearing in a day or so Well  the wars on 
whole plant  at oh-eight-hundred tomorrow and five the guillotine  Whats Washington doingKennebunkport Reaction Lab; they will be here by about oh-three-hundredtomorrow  And a couple of Federal mediators are coming in to La Guardiaat seventeen hundred; theyre going to hold preliminary hearings at thenew Federal Building on Washington Square beginning twenty hundred  Acouple of I F A W  negotiators are coming in from the national unionheadquarters at Oak Ridge: they should be getting in about the sametime  Youd better be on hand  and have Dr  Rives there with you Theres a good chance this thing may get cleared up in a day or so I will undoubtedly be there  complete with Dr  Rives 
It will be a pleasure!
Scott  do you know what those--
Doernberg-Giardano; got a chain-reaction started again Who
excuse was that it would be unsafe to leave the reactor in itsdismantled condition during a prolonged shutdown--they were assuming  Isuppose  that the strike would be allowed to proceed unopposed--but ofcourse the real reason was that they wanted to get a chain-reactionstarted to keep our people from working on the reactor Well  didnt Hausinger try to stop them
his shirt and that Luger on his hip for  but he said he had orders notto use force  for fear of prejudicing the mediators and get Steve and Joe  and come on out  We only work here--when wereable I was afraid Id keep you waiting 
hotel by cab  and there was a frightful jam at Fortieth Street  andanother one just below Madison Square of ten--ninety-nine out of a hundred--its the fault of some fool doingsomething stupid  Speaking about doing stupid things  though--I did one Forgot to take that gun out of my overcoat pocket  and didnt noticethat I had it till I was on the subway  coming in  Have a big flashlightin the other pocket  but that doesnt matter  What Im worried about isthat somebodyll find out I have a gun and raise a howl about my comingarmed to a mediation hearing We mustnt discuss business until the others get here 
theyll be sure to think were trying to take an unfair advantage ofthem  I suppose neither of you have had time to see any of the newplays discussion  so that everybody can see what everybody elses position inthe matter is  We wont bother to make a sound recording  Then  if wehave managed to reach some common understanding of the question thisevening  we can start the regular hearing say at thirteen hundredtomorrow  Is that agreeablethe discharge  by Mr  Melroy  of two of his employees  named Koffler andBurris  Is that correctattempting to use strike-breakers  and the Long Island Atomic PowerAuthoritys having condoned this unfair employment practice strike on my company We resent that characterization!
or declaration of intention  which this was in illegal manner  at the Long Island Reaction Plant On sixteen hours notice 
Well  that wasnt the fault of the I F A W  as an organization 
postponed for two weeks  in accordance with the provisions of theFederal Labor Act Well  how about my company
members walked out on me  without any notice whatever  at twelve hundredtoday  Am I to consider that an act of your union  or will you disavowit so that I can fire all of them for quitting without permissioninstructions from Harry Crandall  in re-packing the Number OneDoernberg-Giardano breeder-reactor at our plant  after the plutonium andthe U-238 and the neutron-source containers had been removed  in orderto re-initiate a chain reaction to prevent Mr  Melroys employees fromworking on the reactorunion sustains that action  tooI hadnt known about that 
Neither had I 
When did it happen
About sixteen hundred today 
We were on the plane from Oak Ridge  then 
nothing about that Well  are you going to take the responsibility for it  or arent you
Gentlemen 
once  I suggest that we confine ourselves  at the beginning  to thequestion of the dismissal of these men  Burris and Koffler  If we findthat the I F A W  has a legitimate grievance in what we may call theBurris-Koffler question  we can settle that and then go on to theseother questions Im agreeable to that 
So are we 
question  perhaps you gentlemen should state the grounds for yourcomplaints Ill deny those statements  categorically and seriatim 
were disqualified by the tests and dropped from my payroll because ofbeing  in the words of my contract with your union  persons of unsoundmind  deficient intelligence and/or emotional instability  Whathappened is that your local official  Crandall  accepted everything theytold him uncritically  and you accepted everything Crandall told you  inthe same spirit  Melroy continued  turning to Lyons  
       *       *       *       *       *Permission granted by Lyons  Doris Rives rose  At some length  sheexplained the nature and purpose of the tests  and her method of scoringand correlating them asked  Doris Rives became angry  
of the distinguished Austrian psychologists name   Melroy echoed  
My company specializes in cybernetic-control systems 
machines and giant brains  a cybernetic system doesnt really think It only does what its been designed and built to do  and if somebodybuilds a mistake into it  it will automatically and infallibly repeatthat mistake in practice Hes right 
got to be as smart as the machines supposed to be  or the machinell beas dumb as they are anyhowYoure probably a lawyer 
old reaction-plant man then let me ask you: Suppose some moron fixed up something that would gowrong  or made the wrong kind of a mistake himself  around one of thosereactorsWhat the devil--
The main power-reactors  too 
the heat melted the fissionables down to critical mass gone! There arent enough other generators in this area to handle ahundredth of the demand And dont blame that on my alleged strike-breakers 
happened What do you think happened
Doernberg-Giardanos let goYes  Your man Crandall  If he survived that  its his bad luck 
fissionables and radioactives out of the Number One breeder  he found abig nugget of Pu-239  about one-quarter CM  I dont know what was donewith it  but I do know that Crandall had the maintenance gang repackthat reactor  to keep my people from working on it  Nobodyll ever findout just what happened  but they were in a hurry; they probably shovedthings in any old way  Somehow  that big subcritical nugget must havegot back in  and the breeding-cans  which were pretty ripe by that time must have been shoved in too close to it and to one another  You knowhow fast those D-Gs work  It just took this long to build up CM for abomb-type reaction  You remember what I was saying before the lightswent out Well  it happened  Some moron--some untested and undetectedmoron--made the wrong kind of a mistake often enough thats one thing But all those people  out there!
It must have killed everybody for miles around

television program  Tell the gentleman about it Were calling it Crossroads of Destiny 
one half-hour show a week; in each episode  well take some historicevent and show how history could have been changed if something hadhappened differently  We dramatize the event up to that point just as itreally happened  and then a commentary-voice comes on and announces thatthis is the Crossroads of Destiny; this is where history could have beencompletely changed  Then he gives a resumé of what really did happen and then he says  But--suppose so and so had done this and that instead of such and such  Then we pick up the dramatization at thatpoint  only we show it the way it might have happened  Like this thingabout Columbus; well show how it could have happened  and end withColumbus wading ashore with his sword in one hand and a flag in theother  just like the painting  only itll be the English flag  andColumbus will shout: I take possession of this new land in the name ofHis Majesty  Henry the Seventh of England!And then  the sailors all sing God Save the King 
Which wasnt written till about 1745 
Huh
Are you sure
Henry! or St  George for England! or something  Then  at the end  weintroduce the program guest  some history expert  a real name  and hetells how he thinks history would have been changed if it had happenedthis way The crossroads will give out before long 
The sponsorll give out first 
crossroads after another them to keep the show running for a year We have about twenty already written and ready to produce 
staff is working on now be changed Well  of course--
what really did happen  but it stands to reason if something hadhappened differently  the results would have been different  doesntitrun  Thered be some differences at the time  but over the yearswouldnt they all cancel outNon  non  Monsieur!
can be shange!What do you think  Professor
theyd accumulate  Say something happened a century ago  to throw apresidential election the other way  Youd get different people at thehead of the government  opposite lines of policy taken  and eventuallywed be getting into different wars with different enemies at differenttimes  and different batches of young men killed before they could marryand have families--different people being born or not being born  Thatwould mean different ideas  good or bad  being advanced; different bookswritten; different inventions  and different social and economicproblems as a consequence Look  hes only giving himself a century 
the changes if this thing we were discussing  Columbus sailing under theEnglish flag  had happened  Or suppose Leif Ericson had been able toplant a permanent colony in America in the Eleventh Century  or if theSaracens had won the Battle of Tours  Try to imagine the world today ifany of those things had happened  One thing you can be sure of--anyerrors you make in trying to imagine such a world will be on the side ofover-conservatism I dont think you realize just how good an idea you have  here 
timid and unimaginative treatment What do you mean
changed history; you should emphasize the changes that could have beenmade  Youre going to end this show you were talking about with a shotof Columbus wading up to the beach with an English flag  arent youWell  thats the logical ending 
Thats the logical beginning 
after that  your guest historian comes on; how much time will he beallowedshort--syllable  that what we have seen didnt really happen  because if hedoesnt  the next morning half the twelve-year-old kids in the countrywill be rushing wild-eyed into school to slip the teacher the realinside about the discovery of America  By the time he gets that done hell be able to mumble a couple of generalities about vast andincalculable effects  and then itll be time to tell the public aboutWidgets  the really safe cigarettes  all filter and absolutely free fromtobacco Gin-and-tonic 
I see what you mean 
difference it would have made where Columbus would have gotten hisships  as long as he got them and America got discovered  I can see itwould have made a hell of a big difference  But how could it be handledany other way How could you figure out just what the difference wouldhave beenneed a man with a powerful creative imagination  who is used to using itinside rigorously defined limits  Dont try to get them both in one; acollaboration would really be better  Then you work from the knownsituation in Europe and in America in 1492  and decide on the immediateeffects  And from that  you have to carry it along  step by step  downto the present  It would be a lot of hard and very exacting work  butthe result would be worth it you set it up  All you have to do is make sure that nobody else would beable to prove that it wouldnt Well  how could you present that
under the changed conditions  The plot--the reason the coward conquershis fear and becomes a hero  the obstacle to the boy marrying the girl the reason the innocent man is being persecuted--will have to grow outof this imaginary world youve constructed  and be impossible in ourreal world  As long as you stick to that  youre all right Sure  I get that 
asking them to start with an assumption they know isnt true Maybe it is  in another time-dimension 
cant prove it isnt  For that matter  you cant prove there arentother time-dimensions Hah  thats it!
probability  That takes care of that to you Be damned if it does to me 
Well  as far as we know  we live in a four-dimensional universe 
are we going to talk about thatmeasuring in the fourth dimension all the time  A watch You mean its just time But that isnt--
We know of three dimensions of space 
we also locate things in time  I wouldnt like to ride on a train or aplane if we didnt  Well  lets call the time we know  the time yourwatch registers  Time-A  Now  suppose the entire  infinite extent ofTime-A is only an instant in another dimension of time  which well callTime-B  The next instant of Time-B is also the entire extent of Time-A and the next and the next  As in Time-A  different things are happeningat different instants  In one of these instants of Time-B  one of thethings thats happening is that King Henry the Seventh of England isfurnishing ships to Christopher Columbus zhenerally accept een zees countreeGot it!

another nuclear-bomb test  as long as I lived Lee!
all  Its purely a scientific experiment this  back before 1969 this shot were going to make  tonight  Its so much like the otherones  before--Before the Auburn Bomb 
Youve been thinking about that  lately  havent you
Was that what you were dreaming of
Oh  no  thank heaven!
I think about it  too  always  I suppose--
saw it fall  didnt yoube to this shot  tonight  I was in charge of the investigation atAuburn  until we had New York and Washington and Detroit and Mobile andSan Francisco to worry about  Then what had happened to Auburn wasntimportant  any more  We were trying to get evidence to lay before theUnited Nations  We kept at it for about twelve hours after the UnitedNations had ceased to exist is; I probably never shall  But I know that my government did not launchthat missile  During the first days after yours began coming in  Italked to people who had been in the Kremlin at the time  One had beenin the presence of Klyzenko himself when the news of your bombardmentarrived  He said that Klyzenko was absolutely stunned  We alwaysbelieved that your government decided upon a preventive surprise attack and picked out a town  Auburn  New York  that had been hit by one of ourfirst retaliation missiles  and claimed that it had been hit first missile was launched  I know that to be a fact  We could neverunderstand why you launched just that one  and no more until after oursbegan landing on you; why you threw away the advantage of surprise andpriority of attack--Because we didnt do it  Lee!
You believe me when I tell you that
and the people you worked with  and the people I worked with  and yourgovernment  and mine  have been guilty of  it would be a waste of breathfor either of us to try to lie to the other about what happened fifteenyears ago had to be launched by somebody last fifteen yearsthe Soviet Union--not many  and they kept themselves well hidden--whowere dedicated to the overthrow of the Soviet regime  They  or some ofthem  might have thought that the devastation of both our countries  andthe obliteration of civilization in the Northern Hemisphere  would be acheap price to pay for ending the rule of the Communist Party Could they have built an ICBM with a thermonuclear warhead in secret
sides of the Iron Curtain  who might have thought our mutual destructionwould be worth the risks involved out  they could go back to the old ways and the old traditions  OrJapan  or the Moslem States  In the end  they all went down along withus  but what criminal ever expects to fallrocket wouldnt have had to have been launched anywhere in the NorthernHemisphere  For instance  our friends here in the Argentine have beendoing very well by themselves since El Coloso del Norte went down Doctor Richardson; Doctor Pitov! Are you ready
Yes  ready  Were coming 
isnt a weapon projecthad to show an identity card the whole time Ive been here I dont believe I have an identity card

balloons on the job Could you spare a few minutes to talk to the press
important; we cant explain too many times the purpose of thisexperiment  There is still much hostility  arising from fear that we aretesting a nuclear weapon that lead pencil youre using negamatter will ever be so used  Were certainly not working on weaponsdesign here  We started  six years ago  with the ability to producenegative protons  reverse-spin neutrons  and positrons  and thetheoretical possibility of assembling them into negamatter  We have justgotten a fifty kilogramme mass of nega-iron assembled  In those sixyears  we had to invent all our techniques  and design all ourequipment  If wed been insane enough to want to build a nuclear weapon after what we went through up North  we could have done so from memory and designed a better--which is to say a worse--one from memory in a fewdays digging a fifty foot shaft to get a rock to bash somebodys head in when you could do the job better with the shovel youre digging with thing would be ample to construct twenty thermonuclear bombs  And thatsonly a small part of it Then what was the purpose of this experiment  Doctor Richardson
structure  Long ago  it was realized that the nucleonicparticles--protons  neutrons  mesons and so on--must have structure oftheir own  Since we started constructing negative-proton matter  wevefound out a few things about nucleonic structure  Some rather oddthings  including fractions of Plancks constant negamatter atoms together  We annihilated a few of them--over there inthat little concrete building  we have one of the most massive steelvaults in the world  where we do that--but we assembled millions of themfor every one we annihilated  and that chunk of nega-iron inside themagnetic bottle kept growing  And when you have a piece of negamatteryou dont want  you cant just throw it out on the scrap-pile  We mighthave rocketed it into escape velocity and let it blow up in space  awayfrom the Moon or any of the artificial satellites  but why waste it Sowere going to have the rocket eject it  and when it falls  we can see by our telemetered instruments  just what happens Well  wont it be annihilated by contact with atmosphere
Thats one of the things we want to find out 
about twenty percent loss from contact with atmosphere  but the massthat actually lands on the target area should be about forty kilos  Itshould be something of a spectacle  coming down neutrons and the positrons  Doesnt any of this sort of matter exist innaturewhole galaxies composed of nothing but negamatter  There may even beisolated stars and planetary systems inside our Galaxy composed ofnegamatter  though I think that very improbable  But when negamatter andposimatter come into contact with one another  the result is immediatemutual annihilation eight  fifty seven--Two seconds  one second  FIRING!
What kind of radiation are you getting
cosmic  That shouldnt last long own dose of cosmic  and some gamma  It was the cosmic radiation that putthe radios and telescreens out  Thats why I insisted that the droneplanes be independent of radio control Of course  there were no detectors set up in advance around Auburn 
that time  the cosmic radiation was over and we werent getting anythingbut gamma What--What has Auburn to do--
this was the same thingyoure crazy! There wasnt an atom of artificial negamatter in the worldin 1969  Nobody had made any before us  We gave each other somescientific surprises  then  but nobody surprised both of us  You and I between us  knew everything that was going on in nuclear physics in theworld  And you know as well as I do--equipment around the target area  that wasnt knocked out by blast  isbeginning to function again  There is an increasingly heavy gammaradiation  but no more cosmic rays  They were all prompt radiation fromthe annihilation; the gamma is secondary effect  Wait a moment; CaptainUrquiola  of the Air Force  says that the first drone plane is about totake off Lee  were you serious
one at Auburndown out of the sky  I wondered about that at the time--what kind of amissile would produce an effect like that  Now I know  We just launchedone like it was happening in nuclear physics then  Nobody in the world knew how toassemble atoms of negamatter and build them into masses doubt if it even came from this Galaxy  But we didnt know that  then When that negamatter meteor fell  the only thing anybody could think ofwas that it had been a Soviet missile  If it had hit around Leningrad orMoscow or Kharkov  who would you have blamed it on

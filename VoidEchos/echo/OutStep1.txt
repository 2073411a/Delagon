Slim!
You re Slim 
I m Red 
Hi  Red!
Quiet! You want to wake somebody 
What s the matter 
even any of the hands then it ll be  Come on in or you ll catch your death of cold  early  It s like the whole world is just yours  isn t it  Red  No one else around and all like that Didn t you hear it last night Hear what 
Thunder 
Was there a thunderstorm 
window and it wasn t raining  It was all stars and the sky was just getting sort of almost gray  You know what I mean So I just thought I d go out 
Can you keep a secret 
Sure  Red  What kind of a secret 
yet There ll be a circus around 
came here--That s not the secret  Fine secret! Ever see a circus 
Oh  sure  You bet 
Like it 
Say  there isn t anything I like better 
would like to be with a circus  I mean  for good Dad  I think he wants me to be Huh! Astronomer!
A circus  would  be more fun 
You re just saying that 
No  I m not  I mean it 
right now  What would you do I--I--
See!
I d join up 
Go on 
Try me 
in with me What do you mean 
even have a circus of our own  We could be the biggest circus-fellows in the world  That s if you want to go in with me  Otherwise--Well  I guess I can do it on my own  I just thought: Let s give good old Slim a chance I m in! What is it  huh  Red  Tell me what it is Figure it out  What s the most important thing in circuses 
Acrobats 
Holy Smokes! I wouldn t go five steps to look at acrobats 
I don t know then 
crowds  Even in the main rings the best acts are animal acts Do you think so 
morning  Two of them And you ve got them 
Sure  That s the secret  Are you telling 
Of course not 
Okay  I ve got them in the barn  Do you want to see them 
Are they big 
only about so long  I ve got them in a cage can t get away from there  Come on  let s go up to the loft There s sort of a hole in the canvas 
How d that get there 
They re still there 
The canvas appeared to be burned 
You want to look  or don t you 
Watch out 
They don t hurt you 
Ever see anything like them 
No 
Can t you see how a circus would jump at a chance to have these 
Maybe they re too small for a circus 
You re just trying to back out  aren t you 
No  I m not  It s just--
worry What s that 
to figure out what to feed them meanwhile

Where are the youngsters  My son isn t in his room 
breakfast was forced into them among the women some time ago  so there is nothing to worry about  Youth  Doctor  youth!Youth!
think they ll come  The day looks so-- normal  They ll come 
your playing so elaborate a hoax  You really spoke to them As I speak to you  At least  in a sense  They can project thoughts 
I gathered that must be so from your letter  How  I wonder 
perhaps it was just that I could not understand  It involves a projector for the focussing of thought and  even more than that  conscious attention on the part of both projector and receptor  It was quite a while before I realized they were trying to think at me  Such thought-projectors may be part of the science they will give us Perhaps 
bring to society  A thought-projector!Why not  Change would be good for us 
I don t think so 
It is only in old age that change is unwelcome 
and races can be old as well as individuals 
built Beforethewars  I don t know exactly when  It is as good now as the day it was built  We couldn t possibly duplicate it now  The race was young when that was built  eh Then  Yes! At least they weren t afraid of new things 
Destroyed  Doctor! What good were youth and new things  We are better off now  The world is peaceful and jogs along  The race goes nowhere but after all  there is nowhere to go   They  proved that  The men who built the road  I will speak with your visitors as I agreed  if they come  But I think I will only ask them to go The race is not going nowhere 
going toward final destruction  My university has a smaller student body each year  Fewer books are written  Less work is done  An old man sleeps in the sun and his days are peaceful and unchanging  but each day finds him nearer death all the same Well  well 
position in the planetary economy And you found me solvent 
far off  You are less solvent than your father and he was less solvent than his father  Perhaps your son will no longer be solvent  It becomes too troublesome for the planet to support even the industries that still exist  though they are toothpicks to the oak trees of Beforethewars  We will be back to village economy and then to what  The caves of all that broadening of horizons  Look  sir  I chose you to approach in this matter not only because you were rich and influential with government officials  but because you had an unusual reputation  for these days  of daring to break with tradition  Our people will resist change and you would know how to handle them  how to see to it that--that--That the youth of the race is revived 
Yes 
With its atomic bombs 
The atomic bombs 
civilization  These visitors of mine had their atomic bomb  or whatever their equivalent was on their own worlds  and survived it  because they didn t give up  Don t you see  It wasn t the bomb that defeated us  but our own shell shock  This may be the last chance to reverse the process Tell me 
want in return come from a denser planet  Ours is richer in the lighter atoms They want magnesium  Aluminum 
No  sir  Carbon and hydrogen  They want coal and oil 
Really 
have mastered space travel  and therefore atomic power  would want coal and oil  I can t answer that the truth of your story  Superficially  atomic power would seem to preclude the use of coal and oil  However  quite apart from the energy gained by their combustion they remain  and always will remain  the basic raw material for all organic chemistry  Plastics  dyes  pharmaceuticals  solvents  Industry could not exist without them  even in an atomic age  Still  if coal and oil are the low price for which they would sell us the troubles and tortures of racial youth  my answer is that the commodity would be dear if offered gratis There are the boys!
as much of it as it ever had Yes  but we age them quickly and pour them into the mold 
What s this 
didn t know anyone was here  I am sorry to have interrupted It s all right  youngster 
son  there would be no cause for slamming a door Nonsense 
You simply scold him for being young  You  with your views!Come here  lad 
How do you like the country  eh 
Very much  sir  thank you 
My son has been showing you about the place  has he 
Yes  sir  Red--I mean--
two up to  eh Why--just exploring  sir 
curiosity and adventure-lust  The race has not yet lost it Sir 
Yes  lad 
me in for something good to eat  but I don t exactly know what he meant  I didn t like to say so Why  just ask cook  She ll have something good for young uns to eat 
Oh  no  sir  I mean for animals 
For animals 
Yes  sir  What do animals eat 
I am afraid my son is city-bred 
Well 
an animal  lad A small one  sir 
would probably do the trick Thank you  sir 
Do you suppose they ve trapped an animal alive 
country  full of rodents and small creatures  Red is always coming home with pets of one sort or another  They rarely maintain his interest for long shouldn t they 
III

Unbelievable!
Oh  there are larger worlds 
Inhabited 
Well  no 
Why  you could drop your planet into that large ocean and drown it 
Not quite 
inhabitants are large in proportion to their world Nearly ten times our height 
Are you sure they are friendly 
imponderable  They are not dangerous  I think  We ve come across other groups that could not maintain equilibrium after the atomic war stage and you know the results  Introversion  Retreat  Gradual decadence and increasing gentleness Even if they are such monsters 
The principle remains 
We are descending a bit too quickly 
landed you safely twice before Why do you keep silence 
your Floater and help me prepare the Ejector Are you hurt 
I ve sprained something  It hurts to walk 
have to walk despite the pain Can t we rest first 
can be repaired  we may live  Otherwise  we won t Just a few minutes  Let me catch my breath 
you you talk to it Projector  It won t be listening Then blast it  Blast it down 
We can t do that 
you fool
Why not 
plain sight  Don t be afraid of falling with this planet  You ll never even leave it  You probably won t live the day out Why  Why 
happens when a trader kills a native young  even accidentally  What s more  if this is the target-point  then we are on the estate of a powerful native  This might be one of his brood What are they doing 
seems to be the native equivalent of grass 
IV

No one s around  I had my eye peeled  you bet 
got to scoot back to the house What is it 
what you should ve got when I sent you to the house instead of coming back with that stupid grass doesn t come loose like that  It comes in cellophane and it isn t that color till it s cooked You mean it isn t cooked 
take it  It won t hurt you  I tell you there isn t much time Why  What s doing back at the house 
they re looking for me  Maybe the cook told them I took the meat  Anyway  we don t want them coming here after me Didn t you ask the cook before you took this stuff 
water because Dad makes her  Come on  Take it Hi  Dad  Hello  sir 
you Yes  Dad 
Mother tells me you were out early this morning 
Not real early  Dad  Just a little before breakfast 
night and didn t go back to sleep Yes  sir 
What was it that awakened you 
thunder  sort of  and like a collision  sort of Could you tell where it came from 
It  sounded  like it was out by the hill 
walk toward the hill I am ready 
Come on 
Did they say anything about the meat 
No  I guess they don t know about that  They went down to the hill 
What for 
animals eat the meat Well 
smelling it or something Okay 
eat  something   Let s walk along toward the hill and see what Dad and your father are going to do What about the animals 
you give them water Sure  They drank that 
bring them fruit  Anything ll eat fruit

You think the noise was their ship landing 
Don t you think it could be 
If it were  they may all be dead 
Perhaps not 
If they have landed  and are still alive  where are they 
Think about that for a while 
I don t understand you 
They may not be friendly 
Oh  no  I ve spoken with them  They ve--
next step be  Invasion But they only have one ship  sir 
You know that only because they say so  They might have a fleet 
I ve told you about their size  They--
superior to our artillery That is not what I meant 
I had this partly in mind from the first 
letter  Not to agree to an unsettling and impossible trade  but to judge their real purposes  I did not count on their evading the meeting any rate  The world has been at peace too long  We are losing a healthy sense of suspicion  will  speak  I tell you that there is no reason to suppose they can possibly be hostile  They are small  yes  but that is only important because it is a reflection of the fact that their native worlds are small  Our world has what is for them a normal gravity  but because of our much higher gravitational potential  our atmosphere is too dense to support them comfortably over sustained periods  For a similar reason the use of the world as a base for interstellar travel  except for trade in certain items  is uneconomical  And there are important differences in chemistry of life due to the basic differences in soils  They couldn t eat our food or we theirs domed stations of lowered air pressure  devise specially designed ships in its youth  It is simply that they don t have to do any of that  There are millions of worlds suitable for them in the Galaxy  They don t need this one which isn t How do you know  All this is their information again 
This I was able to check independently  I am an astronomer  after all 
That is true  Let me hear what you have to say then  while we walk 
that two general classes of planetary bodies existed  First  the planets which formed at distances far enough from their stellar nucleus to become cool enough to capture hydrogen  These would be large planets rich in hydrogen  ammonia and methane  We have examples of these in the giant outer planets  The second class would include those planets formed so near the stellar center that the high temperature would make it impossible to capture much hydrogen  These would be smaller planets  comparatively poorer in hydrogen and richer in oxygen  We know that type very well since we live on one  Ours is the only solar system we know in detail  however  and it has been reasonable for us to assume that these were the  only  two planetary classes I take it then that there is another 
than the inner planets of the solar system  The ratio of occurrence of hydrogen-ammonia planets and these super-dense water-oxygen worlds of theirs over the entire Galaxy--and remember that they have actually conducted a survey of significant sample volumes of the Galaxy which we  without interstellar travel  cannot do--is about 3 to 1  This leaves them seven million super-dense worlds for exploration and colonization And worlds like ours 
found which contains them  Apparently the development of our solar system was unique and did not follow the ordinary rules creatures from space are asteroid-dwellers in one out of eight stellar systems  but they re completely different from what we ve been discussing still only quoting their unsupported statements presented me with a theory of stellar evolution which I had to accept and which is more nearly valid than anything our own astronomy has ever been able to devise  if we except possible lost theories dating from Beforethewars  Mind you  their theory had a rigidly mathematical development and it predicted just such a Galaxy as they describe  So you see  they have all the worlds they wish  They are not land-hungry  Certainly not for our land intelligent and not reasonable  Our forefathers were presumably intelligent  yet they were certainly not reasonable  Was it reasonable to destroy almost all their tremendous civilization in atomic warfare over causes our historians can no longer accurately determine over those islands--I forget the ancient name--there was only one end in sight  and in plain sight  Yet events were allowed to proceed to that end on a fool s errand after all No fool s errand  sir  Look there 

VI

something what this is  It s a space-ship  That must be why my father came here  He s one of the biggest astronomers in the world and your father would have to call him if a space-ship landed on his estate He only came here because I told him I heard the thunder from here  Besides  there isn t any such thing as a space-ship you can see the rocket tubes How do you know so much 
them  Old books  From Beforethewars Huh  Now I know you re making it up  Books from Beforethewars!
job us Well  it is  too  a space-ship 
Look here  Slim  you mean that s a ship from another world 
wouldn t be so interested if it was anything else Other worlds! Where are there other worlds 
of them  And other stars probably have planets  There s probably zillions of planets You re crazy!
All right  then  I ll show you 
Hey! Where are you going 
 he  tells you  I suppose you ll believe a Professor of Astronomy knows what--here  Do you want them to start asking questions and find out about our animals I don t care  You said I was crazy 
Snitcher! You promised you wouldn t tell 
fault  for starting an argument and saying I was crazy I take it back  then 
Well  all right  You better 
It s awfully small for a space-ship 
Sure  because it s probably a scout-ship 
I ll bet Dad couldn t even get into the old thing 
spend all day here looking at some old space-ship or whatever it is  We ve got to take care of the animals if we re going to be circus-folks  That s the first rule with circus-folks  They ve got to take care of the animals  And anyway What for  Red  They ve got plenty of meat  Let s watch 
and I guess it s about lunch time or they re going to start investigating  Holy Smokes  don t you ever read any detective stories  When you re trying to work a big deal without being caught  it s practically the main thing to keep on acting just like always  Then they don t suspect anything  That s the first law--Oh  all right 

VII

such construction What good is it now 
left  There ll be no second landing  This ship detected life on our planet through accident  Other exploring parties would come no closer than necessary to establish the fact that there were no super-dense worlds existing in our solar system Well  there s no quarreling with a crash landing 
might have been repaired different  Too disturbing  In any case--it s over Lunch about ready  dear 
I m afraid not  You see--
Is anything wrong 
our guest won t mind a little family discussion Pray don t pay any attention whatever to me 
I ve been soothing her for hours and honestly  I don t know why Red should have done it Done what 
Red
He s taken most of the chopped meat 
He s eaten it 
Well  I hope not  It was raw 
Then what would he want it for 
Meanwhile cook s just furious  She caught him vanishing out the kitchen door and there was the bowl of chopped meat just about empty and she was going to use it for lunch  Well  you know cook  She had to change the lunch menu and that means she won t be worth living with for a week  You ll just have to speak to Red  dear  and make him promise not to do things in the kitchen any more  And it wouldn t hurt to have him apologize to cook lunch menu  why should she talking about quitting  Good cooks aren t easy to get  Do you remember the one before her right  He isn t here  I suppose  When he comes in  I ll talk to him You d better start  Here he comes 
guess Got to clean up first  though 
One moment  son 
Sir 
Where s your little friend 
walking and I looked around and he wasn t there said   I suppose it s about lunch time   I said   We got to be getting back to the house   And he said   Yes   And I just went on and then when I was about at the creek I looked around and--about my youngster  He is quite self-reliant  Don t wait lunch for him Lunch isn t ready in any case  Doctor 
something happened to the ingredients  Do you have anything to say Sir 
take the chopped meat The chopped meat 
The chopped meat 
Well  I was sort of--
Hungry 
For raw meat 
No  sir  I just sort of needed it 
For what exactly 
words--You ll remember that just after breakfast my son came in to ask what animals ate take it for an animal pet you ve got said I had an animal  He came in here and said that  He said I had an animal promised he wouldn t tell on you  he didn t  It s your own foolishness in trying to take something without permission that gave you away  That happened to be stealing  Now have you an animal  I ask you a direct question Yes  sir 
All right  you ll have to get rid of it  Do you understand 
meat-eating animal  Red  It might bite you and give you blood-poison They re only small ones 
them They  How many do you have 
Two 
Where are they 
Don t chivvy the child any further 
and that s punishment enough 
VIII

got to speak to Red  I ve got to say something you re being very polite  You ve kept lunch waiting I m sorry  Father 
Oh  don t rate the lad 
to Red if he wants to  and there was no damage done to the lunch I ve got to speak to Red alone 
Now that s enough 
Take your seat 
loose No  it s--
of telling my Dad we were feeding animals as saying we were doing it  Besides  it s something else  Red thought you were coming to the house  They acted like it was my fault you weren t there and let me talk  You don t give a fellow a chance Well  go on and tell me if you ve got so much to say 
anymore and I wanted to see what it was like It isn t a space-ship 
looked inside and they were  dead  They were dead 
 Who  were dead 
animals  They re people-things from other planets Oh  my 
find out We better turn them loose 
They ll tell on us 
They can t talk our language  Not if they re from another planet 
like that to my mother when he didn t know I was in the room  He was talking about visitors who could talk with the mind  Telepathery or something  I thought he was making it up Well  Holy Smokes  I mean--Holy Smokes 
Dad said to get rid of them  Let s sort of bury them somewhere or throw them in the creek He  told  you to do that 
to do what he says  Holy Smokes  he s my Dad golly  if they find out  will we be in trouble!

people 
people 
They re making noises 
I guess they re talking or something 
Aren t you going to do something 
Aren t you 
You found them 
It s your turn  now 
watching You joined in  Slim  You know you did 
here looking for us All right for you 
Wait!
Now what s biting you 
something Where 
if he s  people   maybe it s a disintegrator gun What s that 
space-ships have disintegrator guns  They point them at you and you get disintegratored They didn t point it at us till now 
I m getting my father Cowardy-cat  Yellow cowardy-cat 
them now you ll get disintegratored  You wait and see  and it ll be all your fault where you re keeping them  Cook saw where you ran with the meat Hello  ma!
rid of them right away just looked like little animals and I thought you d let me keep them  ma  I wouldn t have taken the meat only they wouldn t eat grass or leaves and we couldn t find good nuts or berries and cook never lets me have anything or I would have asked her and I didn t know it was for lunch and--
X

point in any publicity now what they are  No  no--I never saw anything like it  Little horrible beasts with--with--I can t describe it  To think that Red was touching them and trying to feed them  He was  holding  them  and feeding them meat I only--
It was not--
today  March! Into the house! And not a word; not one word! I m not interested in anything you have to say  After this is all over  I ll hear you out and as for you  Red  I ll see that you re properly punished killed anything really terrible  They ve just found a new pet describe these animals Can you just tell me if they--
I m sorry 
better take care of her  Will you excuse me before  Surely it is not usual to find animals that are completely unique on an estate such as this I m sorry  Let s not discuss that now 
Except that unique animals might have landed during the night 
What are you implying 
I think we had better go to the barn  sir!

XI

Those 
Those 
repulsive to them What do they say 
that they are not seriously damaged  and that the youngsters treated them well them grass and raw meat to eat  Tell me how to speak to them to you  but perhaps not right away The youngsters were ignorant of your identity 
because we knew they meant well by us according to their own view of the matter  we did not attempt to attack them Attack them 
Why  yes 
We are armed 
We hope 
repairs in their possession they let themselves be handled and caged  I don t understand it intelligent species 
XII

Do you really think the ship will fly 
If they say so 
back  I hope  before too long And when they do 
my part of the agreement  What is more I will move sky and earth to have the world accept them  I was entirely wrong  Doctor  Creatures that would refuse to harm children  under such provocation as they received  are admirable  But you know--I almost hate to say this--Say what 
these creatures  feeding them or trying to  and keeping them hidden  The amazing gall of it  Red told me it was his idea to get a job in a circus on the strength of them  Imagine!Youth!

XIII

Will we be taking off soon 
Half an hour 
ones  We will get very good terms;  very  good terms You don t think they re too close  do you  It would be bad to burn any of them with the rocket blast at this stage of the game They re safe 
Horrible-looking things  aren t they 
Pleasant enough  inside  Their thoughts are perfectly friendly 
picked us up--They call him Red 
 bad  that we re leaving  Only I can t make out exactly why  The nearest I can come to it is something about a lost opportunity with some organization or other that I can t quite interpret A circus 
What  Why  the impertinent monstrosity 
 your  native world; found him sleeping on a field on Earth  red tentacles  six legs  pseudopods and all

confused chirping  and this monotonous motion to and fro in one and the same Straight Line I am no Woman 
world   But thou  whence intrudest thou into my realm of Lineland seeing no man 
it were from my own intestines My wives and children 
are well and happy 
Royal Highness can at any time either see or approach their Majesties  when there at least half a dozen intervening individuals  whom you can neither see through  nor pass by   Is it possible that in Lineland proximity is not necessary for marriage and for the generation of children How can you ask so absurd a question 
were indeed as you suggest  the Universe would soon be depopulated  No  no; neighbourhood is needless for the union of hearts; and the birth of children is too important a matter to have been allowed to depend upon such an accident as proximity   You cannot be ignorant of this   Yet since you are pleased to affect ignorance  I will instruct you as if you were the veriest baby in Lineland   Know  then  that marriages are consummated by means of the faculty of sound and the sense of hearing   that I had but one voice  and that I had not been aware that his Royal Highness had two    said the King  
Nature having herself ordained that every Man should wed two wives--
Why two 
You carry your affected simplicity too far 
combination of the Four in One  viz  the Bass and Tenor of the Man and the Soprano and Contralto of the two Women But supposing 
that a man should prefer one wife or three 
It is impossible 
that the human eye should see a Straight Line and fro with a rhythmic motion of more than usual violence  which continues for the time you would take to count a hundred and one   In the midst of this choral dance  at the fifty-first pulsation  the inhabitants of the Universe pause in full career  and each individual sends forth his richest  fullest  sweetest strain   It is in this decisive moment that all our marriages are made   So exquisite is the adaptation of Bass and Treble  of Tenor to Contralto  that oftentimes the Loved Ones  though twenty thousand leagues away  recognize at once the responsive note of their destined Lover; and  penetrating the paltry obstacles of distance  Love unites the three   The marriage in that instance consummated results in a threefold Male and Female offspring which takes its place in Lineland What!  Always threefold 
twins Bass-voice Monstrosity! yes 
balance of the Sexes be maintained  if two girls were not born for every boy   Would you ignore the very Alphabet of Nature his mates at the first wooing in this universal Marriage Chorus   On the contrary  the process is by most of us many times repeated   Few are the hearts whose happy lot is at once to recognize in each other s voice the partner intended for them by Providence  and to fly into a reciprocal and perfectly harmonious embrace   With most of us the courtship is of long duration   The Wooer s voices may perhaps accord with one of the future wives  but not with both; or not  at first  with either; or the Soprano and Contralto may not quite harmonize   In such cases Nature has provided that every weekly Chorus shall bring the three Lovers into closer harmony   Each trial of voice  each fresh discovery of discord  almost imperceptibly induces the less perfect to modify his or her vocal utterance so as to approximate to the more perfect   And after many trials and many approximations  the result is at last achieved   There comes a day at last when  while the wonted Marriage Chorus goes forth from universal Lineland  the three far-off Lovers suddenly find themselves in exact harmony  and  before they are aware  the wedded Triplet is rapt vocally into a duplicate embrace; and Nature rejoices over one more marriage and over three more births

distinguish the shapes and positions of his subjects   I for my part noticed by the sense of sight  before I entered your Kingdom  that some of your people are lines and others Points; and that some of the lines are larger--You speak of an impossibility 
Line and a Point by the sense of sight is  as every one knows  in the nature of things  impossible; but it can be detected by the sense of hearing  and by the same means my shape can be exactly ascertained  Behold me--I am a Line  the longest in Lineland  over six inches of Space--Of Length 
Fool 
is Length   Interrupt me again  and I have done argument  you shall hear with your ears how by means of my two voices I reveal my shape to my Wives  who are at this moment six thousand miles seventy yards two feet eight inches away  the one to the North  the other to the South   Listen  I call to them moment receiving the sound of one of my voice  closely followed by the other  and perceiving that the latter reaches them after an interval in which sound can traverse 6 457 inches  infer that one of my mouths is 6 457 inches further from them than the other  and accordingly know my shape to be 6 457 inches   But you will of course understand that my wives do not make this calculation every time they hear my two voices  They made it  once for all  before we were married   But they COULD make it at any time   And in the same way I can estimate the shape of any of my Male subjects by the sense of sound But how 
voices  or so disguises his Southern voice that it cannot be recognized as the echo of the Northern   May not such deceptions cause great inconvenience   And have you no means of checking frauds of this kind by commanding your neighbouring subjects to feel one another What!

know  Stranger  that this offence is punishable in my dominions by death   And the reason is obvious   The frail form of a Woman  being liable to be shattered by such an approximation  must be preserved by the State; but since Women cannot be distinguished by the sense of sight from Men  the Law ordains universally that neither Man nor Woman shall be approached so closely as to destroy the interval between the approximator and the approximated    So saying he paused and listened  as if in an ecstasy  to a sound which seemed to me no better than a tiny chirping from an innumerable multitude of lilliputian grasshoppers    replied I  
  said the King  
  replied I; 
 King   Exhibit to me  if you please  this motion from left to right   I   Nay  that I cannot do  unless you could step out of your Line altogether   King   Out of my Line   Do you mean out of the world   Out of Space   I   Well  yes   Out of YOUR world   Out of YOUR Space   For your Space is not the true Space   True Space is a Plane; but your Space is only a Line   King   If you cannot indicate this motion from left to right by yourself moving in it  then I beg you to describe it to me in words   I   If you cannot tell your right side from your left  I fear that no words of mine can make my meaning clearer to you   But surely you cannot be ignorant of so simple a distinction   King   I do not in the least understand you   I   Alas!  How shall I make it clear   When you move straight on  does it not sometimes occur to you that you COULD move in some other way  turning your eye round so as to look in the direction towards which your side is now fronting   In other words  instead of always moving in the direction of one of your extremities  do you never feel a desire to move in the direction  so to speak  of your side   King   Never   And what do you mean   How can a man s inside any direction   Or how can a man move in the direction of his inside   I   Well then  since words cannot explain the matter  I will try deeds  and will move gradually out of Lineland in the direction which I desire to indicate to you   At the word I began to move my body out of Lineland   As long as any part of me remained in his dominion and in his view  the King kept exclaiming  I had at last moved myself out of his Line  he cried in his shrillest voice    
 replied I; 
 When I had done this at great length  I cried triumphantly  taking up the same position as before   But the Monarch replied   Furious at his perversity  and especially indignant that he professed to be ignorant of my sex  I retorted in no measured terms   Hearing these words the King advanced towards me with a menacing cry as if to pierce me through the diagonal; and in that same movement there arose from myriads of his subjects a multitudinous war-cry  increasing in vehemence till at last methought it rivalled the roar of an army of a hundred thousand Isosceles  and the artillery of a thousand Pentagons   Spell-bound and motionless  I could neither speak nor move to avert the impending destruction; and still the noise grew louder  and the King came closer  when I awoke to find the breakfast-bell recalling me to the realities of Flatland

Geometry has only Two Dimensions of three inches represented by three; and if a straight Line of three inches  moving parallel to itself  makes a Square of three inches every way  represented by three-to-the-second; it must be that a Square of three inches every way  moving somehow parallel to itself  but I don t see how  must make Something else  but I don t see what  of three inches every way--and this must be represented by three-to-the-third Go to bed

Once more I dashed my hardest angle against him  at the same time alarming the whole household by my cries for aid   I believe  at the moment of my onset  the Stranger had sunk below our Plane  and really found difficulty in rising   In any case he remained motionless  while I  hearing  as I thought  the sound of some help approaching  pressed against him with redoubled vigor  and continued to shout for assistance   A convulsive shudder ran through the Sphere   thought I heard him say:  me in a louder tone  he hurriedly exclaimed    I exclaimed;

shewn you naught save Plane Figures and their interiors   Now I must introduce you to Solids  and reveal to you the plan upon which they are constructed   Behold this multitude of moveable square cards   See  I put one on another  not  as you supposed  Northward of the other  but ON the other   Now a second  now a third   See  I am building up a Solid by a multitude of Squares parallel to one another   Now the Solid is complete  being as high as it is long and broad  and we call it a Cube Pardon me  my Lord 
an Irregular Figure whose inside is laid open to view; in other words  methinks I see no Solid  but a Plane such as we infer in Flatland; only of an Irregularity which betokens some monstrous criminal  so that the very sight of it is painful to my eyes True

thou hast received a vision; thou hast soared with me to the heights of Spaceland; now  in order to complete the range of thy experience  I conduct thee downward to the lowest depth of existence  even to the realm of Pointland  the Abyss of No dimensions    He ceased; and there arose from the little buzzing creature a tiny  low  monotonous  but distinct tinkling  as from one of your Spaceland phonographs  from which I caught these words    said I

 The lustre of the Monarch  who beamed more brightly than ever upon hearing my words  shewed clearly that he retained his complacency; and I had hardly ceased when he took up his strain again     said my Teacher  
 After this  as we floated gently back to Flatland  I could hear the mild voice of my Companion pointing the moral of my vision  and stimulating me to aspire  and to teach others to aspire   He had been angered at first--he confessed--by my ambition to soar to Dimensions above the Third; but  since then  he had received fresh insight  and he was not too proud to acknowledge his error to a Pupil   Then he proceeded to initiate me into mysteries yet higher than those I had witnessed  shewing me how to construct Extra-Solids by the motion of Solids  and Double Extra-Solids by the motion of Extra-Solids  and all to be patent even to the Female Sex

Dear Grandpapa 
only my fun  and of course I meant nothing at all by it; and we did not know anything then about the new Law; and I don t think I said anything about the Third Dimension; and I am sure I did not say one word about  Upward  not Northward   for that would be such nonsense  you know  How could a thing move Upward  and not Northward   Upward and not Northward!  Even if I were a baby  I could not be so absurd as that  How silly it is!  Ha! ha! ha!Not at all silly

Elaine 
Lady Elaine Trask of Traskon 
Oh  no  Lucas!
It s bad luck to be called by your married name before the wedding 
ball  when you were just home from school on Excalibur That was when I started calling me that  too 
There s a terrace to the west at Traskon New House 
Tomorrow  we ll have our dinner there  and watch the sunset together 
I know  I thought that was to be our sunset-watching place 
You have been peeking 
your surprise saw it from the air  I ll be very surprised at everything inside And very delighted 
I thought I d find you two here 
have tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow together  but need I remind you that today we have guests  and more coming every minute Who came in the Ward car 
Rovard Grauffis  And Otto Harkaman; you never met him  did you  Lucas 
No; not by introduction  I d like to  before he spaces out 
Is the Duke coming 
with him  They re at the Palace now back in town Oh  dear! I hope he doesn t--
Has Dunnan been bothering Elaine again 
speak with her  We got him to leave without too much unpleasantness after tomorrow I m terribly sorry for him 
have let me talk to him  I might have made him understand yourself to that! The man is insane!Elaine  your shawl!
I ll have to come back  some time  and visit them 
They ll miss me 
You ll find a lot of new friends at your new home 
You wait till tomorrow 
I m going to put a word in the Duke s ear about that fellow 
maybe it ll do some good I doubt it  I don t think Duke Angus has any influence over him at all 
Didn t there use to be something they called privacy 
It s a big story  Sesar 
with us  I know everybody at Traskon is watching this by screen You haven t met Captain Harkaman  Lucas 
I know your attitude  but he s a good sort  Personally  I wish we had a few like him around here 
II

now that I meet you  let me congratulate both You re not an investor in the Tanith Adventure  are you 
Lord Trask does not approve of the Tanith Adventure 
instead of exporting robbery and murder to the Old Federation for it Well  our operations are definable as robbery and murder 
And you object  Perhaps you find me personally objectionable I don t care how many planets you raid or cities you sack  or how many innocents  if that s what they are  you massacre in the Old Federation  You couldn t possibly do anything worse than those people have been doing to one another for the past ten centuries  What I object to is the way you re raiding the Sword-Worlds You re crazy!
Young man 
Trask and myself  And when somebody makes a statement you don t understand  don t tell him he s crazy  Ask him what he means  What  do  you mean  Lord Trask best men  You raided me for close to forty vaqueros  farm-workers  lumbermen  machine-operators  and I doubt I ll be able to replace them with as good have you lost to Captain Harkaman escaping to space  like the atmosphere of a low-gravity planet  each generation begotten by fathers slightly inferior to the last  It wasn t so bad when the Space Vikings raided directly from the Sword-Worlds; they got home once in a while  Now they re conquering planets in the Old Federation for bases  and staying there Federation  and I know Space Vikings whose fathers were born on Old Federation planets gentleman isn t crazy  at all  That s what happened to the Terran Federation  by the way  The good men all left to colonize  and the stuffed shirts and yes-men and herd-followers and safety-firsters stayed on Terra and tried to govern the galaxy Well  maybe this is all new to you  captain 
of the Sword-Worlds is an old song to the rest of us  I have too much to do to stay here and argue to sit here and build up population pressure like Terra in the First Century They had that many on Terra alone  And it took us eight centuries to reach that expanding three hundred and fifty years ago  when that ship came back to Morglay from the Old Federation and reported what had been happening out there since the Big War  Before that  we were discovering new planets and colonizing them  Since then  we ve been picking the bones of the dead Terran Federation Some drunk being bounced 
adventure; we re not making any hit-and-run raid  We re taking over a whole planet; it ll be another Sword-World in forty or fifty years Inside another century  we ll conquer the whole Federation 
What I don t understand 
Angus  Lord Trask  if you think the Tanith adventure is doing Gram so much harm make himself King of Gram  and I don t think anybody else could do that  This planet needs a single sovereignty  I don t know how much you ve seen of it outside this duchy  but don t take Wardshaven as typical  Some of these duchies  like Glaspyth or Didreksburg  are literal snake pits  All the major barons are at each other s throats  and they can t even keep their own knights and petty-barons in order  Why  there s a miserable little war down in Southmain Continent that s been going on for over two centuries That s probably where Dunnan s going to take that army of his 
Dunnan with it You don t have to go to Southmain; just go to Glaspyth 
planet will decivilize like anything in the Old Federation Oh   come   Lucas!
too far Yes  for one thing  we don t have the Neobarbarians 
Em-See-Square in nothing flat  Might be a good thing if they did  too; it would stop us squabbling among ourselves Neobarbarians are  anyhow Attila s Huns in spaceships Well  isn t that who they are 
Federation that still have hyperdrive  and they re all civilized  That s if  civilized  is what Gilgamesh is homemade barbarians  Workers and peasants who revolted to seize and divide the wealth and then found they d smashed the means of production and killed off all the technical brains  Survivors on planets hit during the Interstellar Wars  from the Eleventh to the Thirteenth Centuries  who lost the machinery of civilization  Followers of political leaders on local-dictatorship planets  Companies of mercenaries thrown out of employment and living by pillage  Religious fanatics following self-anointed prophets Gram If you do  take a look around 
recruited Yes 
instances  on a dozen and a half planets  in the last eight centuries  of anti-technological movements  They had them on Terra  back as far as the Second Century Pre-Atomic  And after Venus seceded from the First Federation  before the Second Federation was organized You re interested in history 
aboard ship in hyperspace; boredom is the worst enemy  My guns-and-missiles officer  Vann Larch  is a painter  Most of his work was lost with the  Corisande  on Durendal  but he kept us from starving a few times on Flamberge by painting pictures and selling them  My hyperspatial astrogator  Guatt Kirbey  composes music; he tries to express the mathematics of hyperspatial theory in musical terms  I don t care much for it  myself history  You know  it s odd; practically everything that s happened on any of the inhabited planets happened on Terra before the first spaceship Let s go 
the guests ought to find battle-stations  too 
III

noble sir Make way  here!
Let these guards pass 
You lie!
teeth  all of you! You ve intercepted every message she s tried to send me My daughter has sent you no messages  Lord Dunnan 
she wants nothing whatever to do with you only knows how you ve been torturing her to force her into this abominable marriage--Well  really! He actually  is  crazy!
Crazy  am I 
Trask  he wants an interest in Karvall mills  and here s Sesar Karvall  he wants access to iron deposits on Traskon land  And my loving uncle  he wants the help of both of them in stealing Omfray of Glaspyth s duchy  And here s this loan-shark of a Ffayle  trying to claw my lands away from me  and Rovard Grauffis  the fetchdog of my uncle who won t lift a finger to save his kinsman from ruin  and this foreigner Harkaman who s swindled me out of command of the  Enterprise   You re all plotting against me--Sir Nevil 
himself  If you re a good friend to him  you ll get him out of here before Duke Angus arrives Great Satan  are you against me  too 
now--No  curse you  I won t go till I ve spoken to her  face to face--
Lord Dunnan  what do you wish to say to me 
quickly and then go; you are not welcome here Elaine!
your head; why do you speak to me as a stranger  I am Andray  who loves you  Why are you letting them force you into this wicked marriage happily  because I love him  Now  please  go and make no more trouble at my wedding him; they can t make you  Come with me now  They won t dare stop you  I ll take you away from all these cruel  greedy people  You love me  you ve always loved me  You ve told me you loved me  again and again--hated you  either  but you are making it very hard for me not to  Now go  and never let me see you again You lied to me!
You re as bad as the rest of them  all scheming and plotting against me  betraying me  I know what it s about; you all want to cheat me of my rights  and keep my usurping uncle on the ducal throne  And you  you false-hearted harlot  you re the worst of them all!You two!
Help me  here  Get hold of him 
Lucas  he s crazy 
spoken fifty words to him since he came back from his last voyage--Sesar  You don t think  do you  that I need assurance of it Crazy  I ll say he s crazy 
hear what he said about his rights  Wait till his Grace hears about that Does he lay claim to the ducal throne  Sir Rovard 
Duke Angus and the true date of her birth falsified to give Angus the succession  Why  his present Grace was three years old when she was born  I was old Duke Fergus  esquire; I carried Angus on my shoulder when Andray Dunnan s mother was presented to the lords and barons the day after she was born Of course he s crazy 
the Duke doesn t have him put under psychiatric treatment I d put him under treatment 
that ought to be deactivated  before they blow things up We couldn t do that 
nephew--I could do it 
this company of his  Why you people ever let him recruit them Satan only knows ground-fighters  I d like to see how they shape up in combat  before we space out  I can have them ready for action in two hours  and it d be all over before midnight No  Captain Harkaman; his Grace would never permit it 
the independent lords on whom we re counting for support  You weren t here on Gram when Duke Ridgerd of Didreksburg had his sister Sancia s second husband poisoned--

Ducal Salute 
All right; let s shove off 
Sure the car s ready 
Nobles  Wedding March 
For the love of Satan  where s our shawl 
Who approaches us 
Lucas  Lord Trask  Baron of Traskon  He comes to receive the Lady-Demoiselle Elaine  daughter of Lord Sesar Karvall  Baron of Karvall mills  and the sanction of your Grace to the marriage between them freely How say you  Lord Trask 
With all my heart  your Grace 
And you  Lady-Demoiselle Elaine 
It is my dearest wish  your Grace 
to be your sovereign prince  and pledge fealty to us and to our legitimate and lawful successors We do 
 Long live Angus the First of Gram! 
to wear our badge as you see fit  and pledge ourself to maintain your rights against any and all who may presume to invade them  And we declare that this marriage between you two  and this agreement between your respective houses  does please us  and we avow you two  Lucas and Elaine  to be lawfully wed  and who so questions this marriage challenges us  in our teeth and to our despite Darling; we really made it!

Elaine!
Elaine  where are you 
Nikkolay; Andray Dunnan 
What happened to Elaine 
Lucas 
Elaine     Elaine is dead 
she even felt the first one  She didn t suffer at all You were hit twice 
smashed the femur  And one in the chest  That one missed your heart by an inch Pity it did 
her down  and tried to cover her  I must have thrown her straight into the burst and only caught the last of it myself Dunnan  Did they get him 
took her off-planet I want to get him myself 
About the only thing we could do 
Sesar got shot  too No 
Was he killed 
started  he went charging up the escalator  Didn t have anything but his dress-dagger  Dunnan gave him a quick burst; I think that was why he didn t have time to finish you off  By that time  the guards who d been shooting blanks from that rapid-fire gun got in a clip of live rounds and fired at him  He got out of there as fast as he could  They have Sesar on a robomedic like yours  He isn t in any danger You ll be up and around in a few weeks 
seen to it that everything at Traskon New House will be ready for you by then wouldn t be more than the next minute  That was to be Elaine s house  I won t go to it alone He pirated the  Enterprise  
that company of mercenaries of his  and he d bribed some of the people at the Gorram shipyards  I thought Alex would kill his chief of security when he found out what had happened  We can t prove anything--we re trying hard enough to--but we re sure Omfray of Glaspyth furnished the money  He s been denying it just a shade too emphatically Then the whole thing was planned in advance 
before he started recruiting that company  I think he meant to do it the night before the wedding  Then he tried to persuade the Lady-Demoiselle Elaine to elope with him--he seems to have actually thought that was possible--and when she humiliated him  he decided to kill both of you first at your word and accepting your offer  then How did he get hold of that Westlands Telecast and Teleprint car 
office and told them he had the inside story on the marriage and why the Duke was sponsoring it  Made it sound as though there was some scandal; insisted that a reporter come to Dunnan House for a face-to-face interview  They sent a man  and that was the last they saw him alive; our people found his body at Dunnan House when we were searching the place afterward  We found the car at the shipyard; it had taken a couple of hits from the guns at Karvall House  but you know what these press cars are built to stand  He went directly to the shipyard  where his men already had the  Enterprise ; as soon as he arrived  she lifted out Rovard  how soon will that second ship be finished 
everything we had  The duchy s on the edge of bankruptcy now  We stopped work on the second ship six months ago because we didn t have enough money to keep on with her and still get the  Enterprise  finished  We were expecting the  Enterprise  to make enough in the Old Federation to finish the second one  Then  with two ships and a base on Tanith  the money would begin coming in instead of going out  But now--It leaves me where I was on Flamberge 
King Napolyon was going to help the Elmersans  and I d have gotten a command in that  It s too late for that now here on Gram  That s if you don t mind commanding under me as owner-aboard  I am going hunting for Andray Dunnan I d count it an honor  Lord Trask  But where will you get a ship 
Angus can finish her for me  and pay for it by pledging his new barony of Traskon You mean  you ll trade Traskon for that ship 
Finished  equipped and ready for space  yes 
The Duke will agree to that 
Traskon is all you own If I have a ship  I won t need them  I am turning Space Viking 
Lucas Trask--Space Viking 
Now I ve heard everything 
That was another Lucas Trask  Rovard  He s dead  now

pleasant to be a shipless captain living on strangers  bounty  I d hate  though  to have you think  some time  that I d advanced my own fortunes at the expense of yours you are  I need a space-captain  and your misfortune is my own good luck off Gram  at all A few years at the University of Camelot  on Excalibur  Otherwise  no 
yourself to figures  that is  but do they mean anything to you  I know they don t to a good many spacemen  even  We talk glibly about ten to the hundredth power  but emotionally we still count   One  Two  Three  Many   A ship in hyperspace logs about a light-year an hour  You can go from here to Excalibur in thirty hours  But you could send a radio message announcing the birth of a son  and he d be a father before it was received  The Old Federation  where you re going to hunt Dunnan  occupies a space-volume of two hundred billion cubic light-years  And you re hunting for one ship and one man in that  How are you going to do it  Lord Trask do it  There are planets in the Old Federation where Space Vikings come and go; raid-and-trade bases  like the one Duke Angus planned to establish on Tanith  At one or another of them  I ll pick up word of Dunnan  sooner or later he ll be gone for a year and a half to two years  We ve been raiding the Old Federation for over three hundred years  Lord Trask  At present  I d say there are at least two hundred Space Viking ships in operation  Why haven t we raided it bare long ago  Well  that s the answer: distance and voyage-time  You know  Dunnan could die of old age--which is not a usual cause of death among Space Vikings--before you caught up with him  And your youngest ship s-boy could die of old age before he found out about it else that means anything to me life  I want a ship of my own  like the  Corisande   that I lost on Durendal  Some day  I ll have one  But till you can command your own ship  I ll command her for you  That s a promise You take it easy  Lucas 
damage-control work on you  and don t strain the machinery till it s fixed  We have plenty of time  We re not going to get anywhere chasing Dunnan  The only way we can catch him is by interception  The longer he moves around in the Old Federation before he hears we re after him  the more of a trail he ll leave  Once we can establish a predictable pattern  we ll have a chance  Then  some time  he ll come out of hyperspace somewhere and find us waiting for him Do you think he went to Tanith 
on Tanith  anyhow  You know the kind of a crew he has That gang aren t even good enough for routine raiding 
on Tanith  Unless Dunnan s completely crazy  which I doubt  he s gone to some regular Viking base planet  like Hoth or Nergal or Dagon or Xochitl  to recruit officers and engineers and able spacemen to Tanith--was that aboard when he took the ship or Nergal or Xochitl  On a Viking-occupied planet in the Old Federation  that stuff s almost worth its weight in gold What s Tanith like 
like Haulteclere or Flamberge  It was one of the last planets the Federation colonized before the Big War  Nobody knows what happened  exactly  There wasn t any interstellar war; at least  you don t find any big slag-puddles where cities used to be  They probably did a lot of fighting among themselves  after they got out of the Federation  There s still some traces of combat-damage around  Then they started to decivilize  down to the pre-mechanical level--wind and water power and animal power  They have draft-animals that look like introduced Terran carabaos  and a few small sailboats and big canoes and bateaux on the rivers  They have gunpowder  which seems to be the last thing any people lose             *       *       *       *       *  All right  they d try Xochitl first  Harkaman knew the planet  and was friendly with the Haulteclere noble who ruled it   The work went on at the Gorram shipyard; it had taken a year to build the  Enterprise   but the steel-mills and engine-works were over the preparatory work of tooling up  and material and equipment was flowing in a steady stream  Lucas let them persuade him to take more rest  and day by day grew stronger  Soon he was spending most of his time at the shipyard  watching the engines go in--Abbot lift-and-drive for normal space  Dillingham hyperdrive  power-converters  pseudograv  all at the center of the globular ship   Living quarters and workshops went in next  all armored in collapsium-plated steel  Then the ship lifted out to an orbit a thousand miles off-planet  followed by swarms of armored work-craft and cargo-lighters; the rest of the work was more easily done in space  At the same time  the four two-hundred-foot pinnaces that would be carried aboard were being finished  Each of them had its own hyperdrive engines  and could travel as far and as fast as the ship herself   Otto Harkaman was beginning to be distressed because the ship still lacked a name  He didn t like having to speak of her as name-marked   Elaine   Trask thought  at once  and almost at once rejected it  He didn t want her name associated with the things that ship would do in the Old Federation   Revenge    Avenger    Retribution    Vendetta ; none appealed to him  A news-commentator  turgidly eloquent about the nemesis which the criminal Dunnan had invoked against himself  supplied it   Nemesis  it was   Now he was studying his new profession of interstellar robbery and murder against which he had once inveighed  Otto Harkaman s handful of followers became his teachers  Vann Larch  guns-and-missiles  who was also a painter; Guatt Kirbey  sour and pessimistic  the hyperspatial astrogator who tried to express his science in music; Sharll Renner  the normal-space astrogator  Alvyn Karffard  the exec  who had been with Harkaman longest of all  And Sir Paytrik Morland  a local recruit  formerly guard-captain to Count Lionel of Newhaven  who commanded the ground-fighters and the combat contragravity  They were using the farms and villages of Traskon for drill and practice  and he noticed that while the  Nemesis  would carry only five hundred ground and air fighters  over a thousand were being trained   He commented to Rovard Grauffis    the Duke s henchman said  
 And Duke Angus would tax his new subjects of Glaspyth to redeem the pledges on his new barony of Traskon  Some old Pre-Atomic writer Harkaman was fond of quoting had said          *       *       *       *       *  The  Nemesis  came back to the Gorram yards and settled onto her curved landing legs like a monstrous spider  The  Enterprise  had borne the Ward sword and atom-symbol; the  Nemesis  should bear his own badge  but the bisonoid head  tawny on green  of Traskon  was no longer his  He chose a skull impaled on an upright sword  and it was blazoned on the ship when he and Harkaman took her out for her shakedown cruise   When they landed again at the Gorram yards  two hundred hours later  they learned that a tramp freighter from Morglay had come into Bigglersport in their absence with news of Andray Dunnan  Her captain had come to Wardshaven at Duke Angus  urgent invitation and was waiting for them at the Ducal Palace   They sat  a dozen of them  around a table in the Duke s private apartments  The freighter captain  a small  precise man with a graying beard  alternately puffed at a cigarette and sipped from a beaker of brandy    he was saying  
 The room was still  The breeze fluttered curtains at the open windows; from the garden below  winged night-things twittered   [Illustration]   Harkaman said  
 He poured wine for himself  
  Rovard Grauffis said  
 The freighter captain s beaker was half empty  He filled it to the brim from the decanter    he agreed  
  The man with the gray beard shrugged    [Illustration]   Guatt Kirbey said

Pretty good  Guatt 
Good  Gehenna; it was perfect 
Oh  I suppose it ll have to do 
made it a little closer  Need three microjumps  now  and I ll have to cut the last one pretty fine  Now don t bother me Take it easy  Lucas 
control  We only think he might be here I m sure he is  He has to be 
disappointment  If we don t  and he is  it s a disaster All right 
Jumping 
You know 
wasn t too bad  I think we can make it in one more microjump micro-
What do you think about it 
Where should Guatt put us 
As close as possible  of course 
nine hundred hours  By that time  he could have put in a detection-station  and maybe missile-launchers  on the moon  The  Enterprise  carries four pinnaces  the same as the  Nemesis ; in his place  I d have at least two of them on off-planet patrol  So let s accept it that we ll be detected as soon as we come out of the last jump  and come out with the moon directly between us and the planet  If it s occupied  we can knock it off on the way in by the planet Would you 
the moon  they could launch at us in a curve around the planet  by data relayed from the other side  and we d be at a disadvantage replying  Just go straight in  You hearing this  Guatt look here a minute All right  jumping 
a million miles All yours  Sharll 
Eight hours to atmosphere 
to waste a lot of time shooting up Junior  there planetbuster  or four or five thermonuclears Have a good nap 
Radio and screen signals  Not much  but some  The locals wouldn t have learned enough for that in the five years since I was here  We didn t stay long enough  for one thing You didn t lose any men  did you 
fifty hours  This we re getting is outside stuff; somebody s there beside the locals Is Paul getting anything new 
Detection! Detection from planet! Radar  and microray!
Coming from a definite point  about twenty-fifth north parallel 
There s nothing at all on the moon from the west Is she the  Enterprise  
Can t tell  yet 
in the screen! That spark  about thirty degrees north  just off the west side detected!She s calling us 
Interrogative: What ship are you  Informative: her screen combination  Request: Please communicate All right 
What s her screen-combination to Tanith  Who s the gentleman with you  He isn t the Duke of Wardshaven  is he 
VIII

the  Space Scourge  you re in  I take it  What are you doing here on Tanith That s Garvan Spasso  in the  Lamia  
doing here  we ve taken this planet over  We intend keeping it  too one another  And you have a little planet  all your very own  I m so happy for both of you  What are you getting out of it--beside poultry Tanith is our planet  You think you can take it away from us I know we could  and so do you 
and Spasso together; why  a couple of our pinnaces could knock the  Lamia  apart  The only question is  do we want to bother Then the  Enterprise  didn t come here at all!
Isn t that the  Enterprise  you re in 
Oh  no  Pardon my remissness  Captain Valkanhayn 
Lucas Trask  is owner-aboard  for whom I am commanding  Lord Trask  Captain Boake Valkanhayn  of the  Space Scourge   Captain Valkanhayn is a Space Viking ship is approaching  You mean to tell me that the  Enterprise  hasn t been here You mean the Duke of Wardshaven has two ships 
As far as I know  the Duke of Wardshaven hasn t any ships 
of Lord Trask  The  Enterprise   for which we are looking  is owned and commanded by one Andray Dunnan a base  That was what we d heard  We heard you d gone from Flamberge to Gram to command for him Where did you hear this  And when 
brought the news from Xochitl good enough  when it was fresh  It was a year and a half old when you got it  though  How long have you been here on Tanith About a thousand hours 
Boake  Say hello to Garvan for me when he comes up You mean you re not staying 
You re just spacing right out again 
 Enterprise  has obviously gone somewhere else  She was still in hyperspace when Captain Valkanhayn and his accomplice arrived here Is there anything worth staying for 
Beside poultry  that is 
and Captain Spasso s  Let them be stuck with it ten or twenty thousand people; temples and palaces and everything  Then  there are a couple of old Federation cities  The one we re at is in good shape  and there s a big spaceport  We ve been doing a lot of work on it  And the locals won t give you any trouble  All they have is spears and a few crossbows and matchlocks--I know  I ve been here 
Well  couldn t we make some kind of a deal 
get Garvan on screen and switch him over to your ship--Well  we have a lot of Sword-World merchandise aboard 
fixed for robotic equipment But aren t you going to stay here 
on this  Just excuse me for a minute--The humor escapes me 
We came here on a fools  errand 
I m sorry  Lucas 
it s a letdown  but that pair of chiseling chicken thieves! I could almost pity them  if it weren t so funny know what their idea was Who are they 
like Set and Hertha and Melkarth  where the locals haven t anything to fight with--or anything worth fighting for  I didn t know they d teamed up  but that figures  Nobody else would team up with either of them  What must have happened  this story of Duke Angus  Tanith adventure must have filtered out to them  and they thought that if they got here first  I d think it was cheaper to take them in than run them out  I probably would have  too  They do have ships  of a sort  and they do raid  after a fashion  But now  there isn t going to be any Tanith base  and they have a no-good planet and they re stuck with it Can t they make anything out of it themselves 
Like what 
no men  Not for a job like that  The only thing they can do is space out and forget it We could sell them equipment 
thing  we do want to let down and give the men a chance to walk on ground and look at a sky for a while  The girls here aren t too bad  either bath  now and then we d get to where he s been reported  he d be a couple of thousand light-years away the men a chance to get off the ship  here  We can stall this pair along for a while and we won t have any trouble with them Just holding ship s meetings 
back and forth for a couple of hours  yet Yes; Valkanhayn and Spasso don t own their ships 
maintenance till everybody owns everything in common  The ships look like it  too  They don t even command  really; they just preside over elected command-councils the Duke of Wardshaven at all That s correct 
thought another Gram ship  the  Enterprise   would be here  Since she isn t  there s no point in our being here  We do hope  though  that you won t make any difficulty about our letting down and giving our men a couple of hundred hours  liberty  They ve been in hyperspace for three thousand hours See!
He wants to trick us into letting him land--
Captain Spasso 
everybody s intelligence  your own included going to do here  You expected Captain Harkaman here to establish a base for the Duke of Wardshaven  and you thought  if you were here ahead of him and in a posture of defense  that he d take you into the Duke s service rather than waste ammunition and risk damage and casualties wiping you out  Well  I m very sorry  gentlemen  Captain Harkaman is in my service  and I m not in the least interested in establishing a base on Tanith I get it!
 Enterprise  and this one  The Duke of Wardshaven fitted out the  Enterprise   and somebody else fitted out this one  They both want to put in a base here!Why  sure you can land  Otto 
like to be three thousand hours in hyper  myself you about midnight there now  How s the spaceport  When I was here  it was pretty bad Oh  we ve been fixing it up  We got a big gang of locals working for us--
of jobs  to keep a civilization running  Smash the installations and kill the top technicians and scientists  and the masses don t know how to rebuild and go back to stone hatchets  Kill off enough of the masses and even if the planet and the know-how is left  there s nobody to do the work  I ve seen planets that decivilized both ways  Tanith  I think  is one of the latter But some of them survived  Don t they know what happened 
buildings by wizard arts  Then the sorcerers fought among themselves and went away   That s all they know about it 
I don t envy the poor buggers 
Spasso have probably made slaves of the lot of them  If I was really going to put in a base here  I wouldn t thank that pair for the kind of public-relations work they ve been doing among the locals 
IX

that were any good for work here; we gathered the rest up at villages along the big river How do you get food for them 
Or don t you bother 
Oh  we gather that up all over 
parties out with landing craft  They ll let down on a village  run the locals out  gather up what s around and bring it here  Once in a while they put up a fight  but the best they have is a few crossbows and some muzzle-loading muskets  When they do  we burn the village and machine-gun everybody we see That s the stuff 
be milked  just shoot her  Of course  you don t get much milk out of her again  but--Pick all this stuff up off the locals 
river where we recruited the fellows we re using to boss the workers come!for the work they do or for the things you take from them any kind of a mess out of it you want to You think we  ought  to pay them 
bunch of savages!took it over  You ve been there; you ve seen what Prince Viktor does with them now We haven t got the men or equipment they have on Xochitl 
We can t afford to coddle the locals 
You can t afford not to 
here  You can only use one for raiding; the other will have to stay here to hold the planet  If you take them both away  the locals  whom you have been studiously antagonizing  will swamp whoever you leave behind  And if you don t leave anybody behind  what s the use of having a planetary base Well  why don t you join us 
With our three ships we could have a real thing  here 
The gentlemen 
us Well  if you want to put it like that 
admit  your  Nemesis  would be the big end of it  But why not  Three ships  we could have a real base here  Nikky Gratham s father only had two when he started on Jagannath  and look what the Grathams got there now Are we interested 
have great possibilities  Suppose we reserve decision for a while and look around a little Have your fill of Space Viking glamour  Lucas 
For the moment  I m told that this lot aren t typical 
with it Valkanhayn are a pair of ignominious little crooks  and stupid along with it  If Andray Dunnan had gotten here ahead of us  he might have done one good thing in his wretched life  I can t understand why he didn t come here I think he still will 
Nevil Ormm  Ormm s ambitious  and Dunnan is insanely vindictive--I m telling  you  that!
Why didn t he come here directly  then 
constructive; Dunnan s a destroyer  I think he took that cargo of equipment somewhere and sold it  I think he ll wait till he s fairly sure the other ship is finished  Then he ll come in and shoot the place up  the way--The way he did my wedding; I think of it all the time 
to contragravity and nuclear energy gunpowder  for one thing  and I can think of some rather impressive Old Terran civilizations that didn t have that much  They have an organized society  and anybody who has that is starting toward civilization Valkanhayn stay here long are often tough while they re happening  I know what ll happen to Spasso and Valkanhayn  though  They ll start decivilizing  themselves  They ll stay here for a while  and when they need something they can t take from the locals they ll go chicken-stealing after it  but most of the time they ll stay here lording it over their slaves  and finally their ships will wear out and they won t be able to fix them  Then  some time  the locals ll jump them when they aren t watching and wipe them out  But in the meantime  the locals ll learn a lot from them You know 
I m going to let Spasso and Valkanhayn persuade me to take this planet away from them You crazy or something 
him he s crazy  Ask him what he means   Who said that On target 
 What  do  you mean  Lord Trask  
interception  You know the source of that quotation  too  This looks to me like a good place to intercept him  When he learns I have a base here  he ll hit it  sooner or later  And even if he doesn t  we can pick up more information on him  when ships start coming in here  than we would batting around all over the Old Federation up a base like Nergal or Xochitl five ships  Space Vikings  traders  Gilgameshers and so on  on either of those planets all the time  If we had the cargo Dunnan took to space in the  Enterprise   we could start a base like that  But we haven t anything near what we need  and you know what Spasso and Valkanhayn have Adventure  from Duke Angus down  lost everything they put into it  If they re willing to throw some good money after bad  they can get it back  and a handsome profit to boot  And there ought to be planets above the rowboat and ox-cart level not too far away that could be raided for a lot of things we d need They won t be the kind Spasso and Valkanhayn are in the habit of raiding  though  And besides machinery  we can get gold  and valuable merchandise that could be sold on Gram  And if we could make a go of it  you d go farther hunting Dunnan by sitting here on Tanith than by going looking for him  That was the way we used to hunt marsh pigs on Colada  when I was a kid; just find a good place and sit down and wait I believe  together  we could really make something out of this planet 
That s what we ve been telling you  all along 
This is a wonderful planet--
spaceport  for one thing Well  what s this  here 
It was a spaceport 
we d need a shipyard  capable of any kind of heavy repair work  Capable of building a complete ship  in fact  I never saw a ship come into a Viking base planet with any kind of a cargo worth dickering over that hadn t taken some damage getting it  Prince Viktor of Xochitl makes a good half of his money on ship repairs  and so do Nikky Gratham on Jagannath and the Everrards on Hoth And engine works  hyperdrive  normal space and pseudograv 
robotic-equipment works  and--Oh  that s out of all reason!
twenty trips with a ship the size of this one to get all that stuff here  and how d we ever be able to pay for it  Enterprise   practically a duplicate of the  Nemesis   carried everything that would be needed to get it started  when she was pirated When she was-- 
Now you re going to have to tell the gentlemen the truth 
I intend to 
larger plan; Angus wanted to gain economic supremacy for Wardshaven to forward his political ambitions  It was  however  an entirely practical business proposition  I was opposed to it  because I thought it would be too good a proposition for Tanith and work to the disadvantage of the home planet in the end the project  What did annoy me  to put it mildly  was that just before he took the ship out  Dunnan shot up my wedding  wounded me and my father-in-law  and killed the lady to whom I had been married for less than half an hour  I fitted out this ship at my own expense  took on Captain Harkaman  who had been left without a command when the  Enterprise  was pirated  and came out here to hunt Dunnan down and kill him  I believe that I can do that best by establishing a base on Tanith myself  The base will have to be operated at a profit  or it can t be operated at all join me as partners finance it Tanith adventure will put it up  It s the only way they can recover what they lost on the  Enterprise  But then  this Duke of Wardshaven will be running it  not us 
The Duke of Wardshaven 
here on Tanith  There are three thousand light-years between We ll have to hold a meeting of all three crews 
We will do nothing of the kind 
things here on Tanith  You people may allow your orders to be debated and voted on  but I don t  You will inform your respective crews to that effect  Any orders you give them in my name will be obeyed without argument I don t know how the men ll take that 
I know how they ll take it if they re smart 
running your ships  or how your ships  crews have been running you  Well  we don t do it that way  Lucas Trask is owner  and I m captain  I obey his orders on what s to be done  and everybody else obeys mine on how to do it wants it  Boake  You want to give him an argument  I don t The first order 
working here are to be paid  They are not to be beaten by these plug-uglies you have guarding them  If any of them want to leave  they may do so; they will be given presents and furnished transportation home  Those who wish to stay will be issued rations  furnished with clothing and bedding and so on as they need it  and paid wages  We ll work out some kind of a pay-token system and set up a commissary where they can buy things anything else  We will pay for anything we get from any of the locals We ll have trouble about that 
think anything a local has belongs to anybody who can take it So do I 
planet  and our locals  We don t raid our own planet or our own people  You ll just have to teach them that 
X

taking somebody s livery-and-maintenance can t use too much pressure; make them think it s their own idea We aren t going to spend our time sitting here on Tanith 
the operative word  And we are not going to raid easy planets  A planet that can be raided with impunity isn t worth the time it takes getting to it  We are going to have to fight on every planet we hit  and I am not going to jeopardize the lives of the men under me  which includes your crews as well as mine  because of under-powered and under-armed ships We ve been getting along 
chicken-stealing on planets like Set and Xipototec and Melkarth  Not making enough to cover maintenance expenses; that s why your ship s in the shape she is  Well  those days are over  Both ships ought to have a full overhaul  but we ll have to skip that till we have a shipyard of our own  But I will insist  at least  that your guns and launchers are in order  And your detection equipment; you didn t get a fix on the  Nemesis  till we were less than twenty thousand miles off-planet We had better get the  Lamia  in condition first 
can put her on off-planet watch  instead of that pair of pinnaces You know how that ship s run 
of officers; chief engineer  exec  guns-and-missiles  astrogator and so on  Spasso s just an animated ventriloquist s dummy  I talked to all of them  None of them can pin me down to anything  but they think we re going to heave Spasso out of command and appoint one of them  and each one thinks he ll be it  I don t know how long that ll last  it s a string-and-tape job like the one we re having to do on the ship  It ll hold till we get something better We ll have to get rid of Spasso 
put one of our own people in his place  Valkanhayn can stay in command of the  Space Scourge ; he s a spaceman  But Spasso s no good for anything first  and make a big raid  Space Scourge  back to Gram empty  When Baron Rathmore and Lord Valpry and the rest of them talk to Duke Angus and the Tanith investors  they ll have to have a lot more than some travel films of Tanith  They ll have to be able to show that Tanith is producing  We ought to have a little money of our own to invest  too But  Otto; both ships 
and finds nobody here but Spasso and the  Lamia  year and a half before Dunnan shows up here  I know  we were fooled trying to guess what he d do before  But the sort of raid I have in mind  we ll need two ships  and in any case  I don t want to leave both those ships here while we re gone  even if you do trust Spasso here alone  can we Alvyn--that ll mean a lot of work for me that he d otherwise do  on the ship  And Baron Rathmore  and young Valpry  and the men who ve been training our sepoys  We can shuffle things around and leave some of Valkanhayn s men in place of some of Spasso s  We might even talk Spasso into going along  That ll mean having to endure him at our table  but it would be wise Have you picked a place to raid 
here  That won t amount to much; just chicken-stealing  It ll give our green hands some relatively safe combat-training  and it ll give us some idea of how Spasso s and Valkanhayn s people behave  and give them confidence for the next job And then 
old  A lot of things can happen in twenty years  All I know of it--I was never there myself--is it s fairly civilized--about like Terra just before the beginning of the Atomic Era  No nuclear energy  they lost that  and of course nothing beyond it  but they have hydroelectric and solarelectric power  and nonnuclear jet aircraft  and some very good chemical-explosive weapons  which they use very freely on each other  It was last known to have been raided by a ship from Excalibur twenty years ago That sounds promising  And the third planet 
difference there  but if we saved Amaterasu for last  we might be needing too many repairs It s like that 
mention Beowulf to Captains Spasso and Valkanhayn  Wait till we ve hit Khepera and Amaterasu  They may be feeling like heroes  then 
XI

That was a good one; that was a good one!
five days  and all the stuff we gathered up around them  We took over two million stellars Knock it off  Spasso  You said that before 
Who do you think you are-- 
He thinks he s Lord Trask of Tanith 
too; he is pop your mouth about a lousy two million stellars  Nearer a million and a half  but two million s nothing to pop about  Maybe it would be for the  Lamia   but we have a three-ship fleet and a planetary base to meet expenses on  Out of this raid  a ground-fighter or an able spaceman will get a hundred and fifty stellars  We ll get about a thousand  ourselves  How long do you think we can stay in business doing this kind of chicken-stealing You call this chicken-stealing 
Tanith  If you live that long Well  you saw the elephant  Lucas 
to have liked it Elephant 
elephant was an animal about the size of one of your Gram megatheres  The expression means  experiencing something for the first time which makes a great impression  Elephants must have been something to see  This was your first Viking raid  You ve seen it  now They don t have a chance 
fighting Yes; stupid of them  isn t it 
What would you do in their place 
me  Terro-humans are all stupid like that  That s why we re human Poor devil 
No 
Great Satan  Lucas! Why did you do that 
I wish Andray Dunnan had done that for me 
he had  How many more happinesses do you think we ve smashed here today  And we don t even have Dunnan s excuse of madness It was a filthy business 
ask me who said that Space Vikings are professional robbers and murderers  but who was it said that he didn t care how many planets were raided and how many innocents massacred in the Old Federation A dead man  Lucas Trask of Traskon 
You wish  now  that you d kept Traskon and stayed on Gram 
I m doing now  I can get used to this  I suppose my first raid  and had bad dreams about it for a year rest  for a couple of hours  Then draw some alcodote-vitamin pills from the medic  As soon as things are secured  there ll be parties all over the ship  and we ll be expected to look in on every one of them  have a drink  and say  Well done  boys  
XII

They got radio  and they got radar 
Well  so what 
years ago  when Rock Morgan was here in the  Coalsack   But they don t have nuclear energy  do they but nothing nuclear with a gun can lick half a dozen with clubs  And two ships with nuclear weapons can lick a whole planet without them  Think it s time  Lucas Paul  can you cut in on that Eglonsby station yet 
What are you going to do 
and then we will pick out another city and summon it to surrender  I don t think the second one will refuse  If we are going to be murderers  we ll do it right  this time Neobarbs a lesson--Eglonsby  Space Vikings    Vann 
four miles over the city Communicate at once Will you hold your fire until somebody in authority can communicate with you  This is the chief operator at the central State telecast station; I have no authority to say anything to you  or discuss anything Oh  good  that sounds like a dictatorship 
everything surrender the city to us  If this is not done within the hour  the city and everybody in it will be obliterated the Council of Syndics  We will switch President Pedrosan over as soon as he can speak directly to the personage in supreme command of your ships That is myself; switch him to me at once 
lives and destruction of property You don t begin to  Do you know anything about nuclear weapons 
fissionables on this planet Eglonsby and for a radius of almost a hundred miles  Are you still prepared to resist I have all powers in any emergency  I think 
automatically ratify any decision I make dictatorship  with parliamentary false front If he isn t a false-front dictator for some oligarchy 
How large is this Council 
Syndicate of Labor  the Syndicate of Manufacturers  the Syndicate of Small Businesses  the    Corporate State  First Century Pre-Atomic on Terra  Benny the Moose 
Let s all go down and talk to them 
contragravity  For winged aircraft powered by chemical fuel  I hope we have time for me to look around  here  I ll bet they even have railroads here great damage
Lord Trask  will you deal with these people directly 
Certainly  Admiral 
expect complete submission  As long as you remain submissive to us  we will do no damage beyond removal of the things we wish to take from it  and there will be no violence to any of your people  or any indiscriminate vandalism  This visit we are paying you will cost you heavily  make no mistake about that  but whatever the cost  it will be a cheap price for avoiding what we might otherwise do You understand  we want maximum value and minimum bulk 
luxury goods of all kinds  Rare-element metals  And monetary metals  gold and platinum  You have a metallic-based currency  I suppose Oh  no!
is based on services to society  Our monetary unit is simply called a credit Gold  to some extent  for jewelry 
And platinum in industry  of course 
If they want gold  they should have raided Stolgoland 
They have a gold-standard currency 
Stolgoland doesn t seem to appear on them I wish it didn t appear on ours  either 
decided to raid them instead of us It isn t too late for these gentlemen to make that decision 
people the Stolgonian currency  The actual currency is paper  theoretically redeemable in gold  In actuality  the circulation of gold has been prohibited  and the entire gold wealth of the nation is concentrated in vaults at three depositories  We know exactly where they are You begin to interest me  President Pedrosan 
You have nuclear weapons  something nobody on this planet has  You have contragravity  something that is hardly more than a legend here  On the other hand  we have a million and a half ground-troops  jet aircraft  armored ground-vehicles  and chemical weapons  If you will undertake to attack Stolgoland  we will place this entire force at your disposal; General Dagró will command them as you direct  All that we ask is that  when you have loaded the gold hoards of Stolgoland aboard your ships  you will leave our troops in possession of the country along with it What 
them by surprise  It will be nothing but plain self-defense been plotting to attack us for years Eglonsby  they would have invaded us the moment your ships lifted out  It s exactly what I d do in their place But you maintain nominally friendly relations with them 
of Eglonsby    Yes  Mr  President; I understand  And they have an embassy here 
They call it that!
a plague-spot of espionage and subversion   !We ll grab that ourselves  right away 
able to round up all their agents outside it  and if we tried to  it would cause suspicion  We ll have to put up a front to deceive them collaborate with us  and you will specifically order your troops mobilized to assist us in collecting the tribute we are levying on Eglonsby your troops concentrated around our landing craft  they ll think it s to help us load our loot military equipment and tanks are being loaded on your contragravity vehicles Is this how you Space Vikings keep faith 
sacking Eglonsby  You promised to leave Eglonsby alone if I helped you get the gold of Stolgoland Stolgoland  You ve taken it unnecessary damage or violence  I ve already hanged a dozen of my own men for rape  murder and wanton vandalism  Now  we expect to be out of here in twenty-four hours  You d better be back here before then  Your own people are starting to loot  We did not promise to control them for you I d do  if I d gotten myself into a mess like that  He ll probably bring half his army back  leave the other half in Stolgoland  and lose both  Suppose we drop in  in about three or four years  just out of curiosity  If we make twenty per cent of what we did this time  the trip would pay for itself

No  we did not 
out of Tanith  we re going to need power  and I don t mean windmills and waterwheels  As you ve remarked  Beowulf has nuclear energy  That s where we get our plutonium and our power units There are  or were  three chief sources of fissionable ores 
Kintour s  Princess of Lyonesse   sixty years ago  He hit one on the Antarctic continent; according to his account  everything there was fairly new  He didn t mess things up too badly  and it ought to be still operating  We ll go in from the south pole  and we ll have to go in fast one of our boys did that who launched it; get his name!sunrise line  That s where those missiles are coming from That s it 
Ship secure 
can call that chicken-stealing  Gram gum-pear brandy you re putting in that coffee  I ll have the same  Just leave out the coffee 
XIV

You know what ll happen 
cargo  and that ll be the last any of us ll hear of him again  He ll probably take it to Joyeuse or Excalibur and buy himself a lordship with it along--Guatt Kirbey will be the astrogator; you d trust him  wouldn t you  And Sir Paytrik Morland  and Baron Rathmore  and Lord Valpry  and Rolve Hemmerding     Space Scourge   too Good  Then we ll be sure nothing crooked is pulled 
when you get to Gram  And ask Duke Angus  as a favor to give him some meaningless position with a suitably impressive title  Lord Chamberlain of the Ducal Washroom  or something  Then he can prime him with misinformation and give him an opportunity to sell it to Omfray of Glaspyth  Then  of course  he could be contacted to sell Omfray out to Angus  A couple of times around and somebody ll stick a knife in him  and then we ll be rid of him for good Of course  we could go ahead with it  now 
of a reaction plant to make sure nobody else tries to take the ship  And I really believe  now  that Valkanhayn can be trusted But we don t know what s been happening on Gram  Glaspyth and Didreksburg could have teamed up and jumped Wardshaven before Duke Angus was ready to invade Glaspyth  Boake might be landing the ship in a trap at Wardshaven first time in history that a Sword-World was raided by Space Vikings in over to this screen about two light-seconds away in a few minutes Prince Trask; Count Harkaman 
thirty-two hundred hours out of Wardshaven on Gram  Baron Valkanhayn commanding  accompanied by chartered freighter  Rozinante   Durendal  Captain Morbes  Requesting permission and instructions to orbit in Baron Valkanhayn 
That s right 
size of a blanket to prove it  I have a whole cargo of scrolls  One says you re Otto  Count Harkaman  and another says you re Admiral of the Royal Navy of Gram He did it!
He made himself King of Gram!
Trask  and Viceroy of his Majesty s Realm of Tanith of Tanith Is his Majesty making it worth while to accept his sovereignty 
That is  beside vellum scrolls 
down  And wait till you see what s crammed into the other ship Did Spasso come back with you 
Angus  He is Chief of Police at Glaspyth  now  and nobody can call what he s doing there chicken-stealing  either  Any chickens he steals  he steals the whole farm to get them The  Space Scourge  stopped that 
the base here  and saw what we d shipped to Gram  they started changing their minds  Only subjects of King Angus will be allowed to invest in the Tanith Adventure his profit My business out here is Andray Dunnan 
Oh  yes 
many words  that he would be most happy if you sent him his nephew s head in a block of lucite  What Dunnan did touched his honor  too  Sovereign princes never see any humor in things like that Tanith you see the defense armament we re bringing  you ll think he does

back  but we didn t want to send the  Rozinante  back empty One thing  I had time to do a little reading  between stops 
The books from the Eglonsby library 
planet was so extensively colonized by the Federation  when there don t seem to be any fissionable ores  The planet produced gadolinium There s only one thing it s good for  and you can t run a spaceship on Diesel oil  I suppose the mines could be reopened  and new refineries built  but    own  We could charge our own prices for it  and we wouldn t need to tell them what gadolinium sells for on the Sword-Worlds we did to Eglonsby and Stolgoland  Where would we get plutonium have everything else By Satan  that s it!
plutonium and Beowulf gadolinium  are you Why not  We could make a big profit on both ends of the deal 
both planets all over the place in a few years  We want that like we want a hole in the head Have you ever heard of a Space Viking ship named the  Enterprise  
Andray Dunnan year ago Chermosh to trade  This ship sacked the city in which they were; some of them lost heavily in world s goods That s a pity 
It is as Yah the Almighty wills 
and worshipers of false gods  The Space Vikings looted their temple and destroyed it utterly; they carried away the graven images and abominations  Our people bore witness that there was much wailing and lamentation among the idolators Almost two years ago  on Jagannath 
on orbit there  getting some light repairs  I met the man a few times  Looks just like those pictures  but he s wearing a small pointed beard  now  He d sold a lot of loot  General merchandise  precious and semiprecious stones  a lot of carved and inlaid furniture that looked as though it had come from some Neobarb king s palace  and some temple stuff  Buddhist; there were a couple of big gold Dai-Butsus  His crew were standing drinks for all comers  Some of them were pretty dark above the collar  as though they d been on a hot-star planet not too long before  And he had a lot of Imhotep furs to sell  simply fabulous stuff What kind of repairs  Combat damage 
after I came in  in company with another ship  The  Starhopper   Captain Teodor Vaghn  The talk was that they were making a two-ship raid somewhere cartridges to hellburners  And he was buying all the air-and-water recycling equipment  and all the carniculture and hydroponic equipment  he could get Did he know  at the time  that I m out here hunting for him 
myself  till six months afterward That checks with the Gilgamesher s story He got the furs on Imhotep; he traded for them 
middle of a glaciation  the land surface down to the fiftieth parallel is iced over solid  There is one city  ten or fifteen thousand  and the rest of the population is scattered around in settlements of a couple of hundred all along the face of the glaciers  They re all hunters and trappers  They have some contragravity  and when a ship comes in  they spread the news by radio and everybody brings his furs to town  They use telescope sights  and everybody over ten years old can hit a man in the head at five hundred yards  And big weapons are no good; they re too well dispersed  So the only way to get anything out of them is to trade for it I think I know where he was 
silver is a monetary metal  On Agni  they use silver for sewer-pipe  Agni is a hot-star planet  class B-3 sun  And on Agni they are tough  and they have good weapons  That could be where the  Enterprise  took that combat damage It doesn t tell us anything  either way 
is away off to the side from Agni and Imhotep in either case Terra-type planet with all that air-and-water and hydroponic and carniculture stuff What sort of a captain is this Teodor Vaghn 
one he knows his business and he has a good ship and a well-trained crew  You think he and Dunnan have teamed up a fleet together He ll know we re after him by now 
where we are  and that puts him one up on us

won t look for any with me Burrik had his base  First  there was a trading ship came in  You may have heard of her; she is the one called the  Honest Horris  Honest Horris 
He had been to Melkarth before 
Burrik are friends of the  Fairdealer  was that the  Honest Horris  was landed beside Burrik s ship for ten days  when two other ships came in  They said one had the blue crescent badge  and the other bore a green monster leaping from one star to another There was a great feast  of all four crews  Then everything of value was loaded aboard the  Fortuna   and all four ships lifted and spaced out together  They said Burrik left nothing of any worth whatever behind; they were much disappointed at that Have any of them been back since 
before his ship put in there  He could still see where the landing legs of the ships had pressed into the ground  but the locals said they had not been back Look  Rovard 
in  didn t you  That s what happens to a ship that raids a planet where there s anything worth taking  Beowulf is lousy with fissionables; they ll give us all the plutonium we can load  in exchange for gadolinium  which we sell them at about twice Sword-World prices  We trade plutonium on Amaterasu for gadolinium  and get it for about half Sword-World prices quote me as saying that whoever has advised His Majesty that that isn t good business is no friend to His Majesty or to the Realm    He wondered why His Majesty didn t stop Lionel of Newhaven from sending the  Blue Comet  out from Gram  He found out from her skipper  the next time she came in          *       *       *       *       *    The captain of the  Blue Comet   who was one of Count Lionel s vassal barons  was silent for a moment    he said  
 The unfortunate grandfather of Duke Angus had always been a subject nice people avoided  The unfortunate grandfather of King Angus was probably a subject everybody who valued their necks avoided   Lothar Ffayle had also come out on the  Blue Comet   He was just as outspoken       Ffayle nodded    Ffayle nodded again   Well  that was understandable  One of the ships that made the shuttle-trip to Gram would carry enough in her strong rooms  in gold and jewels and the like  to pay a handsome profit on the voyage  The bulk-goods that went into the cargo holds was practically taking a free ride  so anything on hand  stuff that nobody would ordinarily think of shipping in interstellar trade  went aboard  A two thousand foot freighter had a great deal of cargo space   Baron Trask of Traskon hadn t even begun to realise what Tanith base was going to cost Gram   [Illustration][Illustration]

You see what you did  now 
were making a customer; what you made was a competitor need a fleet to take it  A couple of Beowulf ships would help  You know them; you fought them  too How did they take it 
Space Vikings  not Gilgameshers  I told him we weren t Gilgameshers  either  as he d find out on Xochitl the next time one of his ships raided one of our planets  Are you going to back me up  Of course  you can always send Prince Viktor my head  and an apology--and a planet full of hellburners  You did perfectly right  Otto; exactly what I d have done in your place subject  Lucas  Prince and Viceroy of Tanith; we consider ourselves very badly served by Prince Trask  We therefore command him to return to Gram  and render to us account of his administration of our colony and realm of Tanith We  Lucas  Prince of Tanith 
acknowledge the suzerainty of the King of Gram  formerly Duke of Wardshaven  It is our earnest desire  if possible  to remain at peace and friendship with the King of Gram  and to carry on trade relations with him and with his subjects   --dammit  he d said 
of some other word--        *       *       *       *       *  Three months later  the next ship  which had left Gram while King Angus  summons was still in hyperspace  brought Baron Rathmore  Shaking hands with him as he left the landing craft  Trask wanted to know if he d been sent out as the new Viceroy  Rathmore started to laugh and ended by cursing vilely     Trask corrected  
 said   Rathmore had lowered his voice  but even so the open landing stage was no place for this sort of talk  He said so  ordered a couple of the locals to collect Rathmore s luggage  and got him into a hall-car  taking him down to his living quarters  After they were in private  Rathmore began again:   Trask stiffened  he asked softly   Rathmore s mouth opened slightly   The girl s name meant nothing to Trask; he did know of her father  a Baron Valdiva  He was lord of a small estate south of the Ward lands and west of Newhaven  Most of his people were out-and-out bandits and cattle-rustlers  and he was as close to being one himself as he could get     Flavia s brother    He shook his head   Rathmore shrugged   he said  
        *       *       *       *       *  The captain of the free Space Viking  Damnthing  was named Roger-fan-Morvill Esthersan  which meant that he was some Sword-Worlder s acknowledged bastard by a woman of one of the Old Federation planets  His mother s people could have been Nergalers; he had coarse black hair  a mahogany-brown skin  and red-brown  almost maroon  eyes  He tasted the wine the robot poured for him and expressed appreciation  then began unwrapping the parcel he had brought in    It was an automatic pistol  with a belt and holster  The leather was bisonoid-hide; the buckle of the belt was an oval enameled with a crescent  pale blue on black  The pistol was a plain 10-mm military model with grooved plastic grips; on the receiver it bore the stamp of the House of Hoylbar  the firearms manufacturers of Glaspyth  Evidently it was one of the arms Duke Omfray had provided for Andray Dunnan s original mercenary company   previous report from that planet    That was practically sizzling hot  Well  something like that had to happen  sooner or later  The Space Viking was asking him if he knew what sort of a place Tetragrammaton was   Neobarbarian  trying to recivilize in a crude way  Small population  concentrated on one continent; farming and fisheries  A little heavy industry  in a small way  at a couple of towns  They had some nuclear power  introduced a century or so ago by traders from Marduk  one of the really civilized planets  They still depended on Marduk for fissionables; their export product was an abominably-smelling vegetable oil which furnished the base for delicate perfumes  and which nobody was ever able to synthesize properly   Space Viking said     he said  touching the pistol          *       *       *       *       *  They played off the tapes that evening  They weren t particularly informative  The locals who had been interrogated hadn t been in actual contact with Dunnan s people except in combat  The man who had been carrying the 10-mm Hoylbar was the best witness of the lot  and he knew little  He had caught one of them alone  shot him from behind with a shotgun  taken his pistol  and then gotten away as quickly as he could  They had sent down landing craft  it seemed  and said they wanted to trade; then something must have happened  nobody knew what  and they had begun a massacre and sacked the town  After returning to their ships  they had opened fire with nuclear missiles    Hugh Rathmore said in disgust  
  Boake Valkanhayn said  
  Harkaman frowned  
 [Illustration]    acknowledged bastard of somebody named Morvill said    Trask agreed  
 demanded   Baron Rathmore started to say something about what Andray Dunnan was crazy enough to do  and what his uncle was crazy enough to do  It was just one of the cracks he had been making since he d come to Tanith and didn t have to look over his shoulder while he was making them    Trask said  
 Rathmore cried    Harkaman had stopped being incredulous  
 passion for Elaine; he pushed that thought hastily from him    himself by adding   There was a time when he had dreaded the possibility that somebody else might kill Dunnan before he could      
XVIII

They bombed and strafed the little farm-towns and villages  They scattered radioactives that killed as many as the bombing  And after they had gone away  this other ship came The  Damnthing   She bore the head of a beast with three very big horns 
captain found out what had happened to us  he left some food and medicines for us We can give you a little equipment  Just remember it of us  when you re back on your feet; we ll be back to trade later  But don t think you owe us anything  The man who did this to you is my enemy  Now  I want to talk to every one of your people who can tell me anything at all    We don t even know Dunnan did it  personally 
nobody ever heard of  sitting on a golden throne  surrounded by a harem spend all my time on Tanith  Say we try Audhumla next  It s the farthest away  We might get there while he s still shooting up Obidicut and Lugaluru  Guatt  figure us a jump for it We caught him  we caught him!
in  continuous acceleration  as much as we can stand  We ll worry about decelerating when we re in shooting distance miles--hundreds  not thousands--35° North Latitude  15° west of the sunset line  Ship is under fire  bomb explosions near her there s another ship detected but not visible  somewhere around the equator  and a third one somewhere out of sight  we can just get the fringe of her contragravity field around the planet She s in trouble 
and water vapor like crazy Well  is she a good guy or a bad guy 
Another ship making signal 
the equator  Sword-World impulse code; her communication-screen combination  and an identify-yourself Well  Sir Nevil! A pleasant surprise 
We last met on the terrace at Karvall House  did we not 
Trask! Satan curse you   !
Well  go for her! Give her everything!
you a friend Sword-World ship  Nemesis ; I m Prince Lucas Trask of Tanith  commanding Royal Mardukan ship  Victrix  
Bentrik  commanding Are you still battle-worthy 
Seventy per cent of the ship s sealed off  and we ve been holed in a dozen places  We have power enough for lift and some steering-way  We can t make lateral way except at the expense of lift into a tight circle above her can to cover you All you can is all you can; thank you  Prince Trask 
Here comes the  Enterprise !
She hairpinned on us 
Well  do something about her!
Well shot   Victrix ! Well shot!
unprintability!That was our planetbuster 
use on Dunnan I didn t know we had one 
weaponeers I wonder 
Dunnan was on that ship 
XIX

I doubt we can get her off-planet again  let alone into hyperspace 
then here haven t been exactly popular on Marduk  lately  They may thank you for bringing me back to stand trial I d have anybody shot who let his ship get caught as I did mine  Those two were down in atmosphere before I knew they d come out of hyperspace I think they were down on the planet before your ship arrived 
Oh  that s ridiculous  Prince Trask!
can t hide a ship on a planet  Not from the kind of instruments we have in the Royal Navy We have pretty fair detection ourselves 
with a thousand or so feet of water over her  That s where I was going to hide the  Nemesis   if I got here ahead of Dunnan But the locals  They didn t know about it 
in directly over the ocean  out of the sun  and nobody d see the ship Is that a regular Space Viking trick 
wanted to ambush your ship  he d have thought of it  too  It s the only practical way to do it You may find you re quite welcome on Marduk  at that 
years  I believe  as you do  that this enemy of yours is responsible for all of them  We have half the Royal Navy out now  patrolling our trade-planets  Even if he wasn t aboard the  Enterprise  when you blew her up  you ve put a name on him and can tell us a good deal about him ridiculous  one might even think he was making war on Marduk Sword-Worlds scraping to the class above him; he s too busy trying to shove himself up into it  And the men who ship out as Space Vikings are the least class-conscious of the lot  Think my men may have trouble on Marduk about that  They ll all insist on doing their drinking in the swankiest places in town aren t twelve feet tall  with three horns like a Zarathustra damnthing and a spiked tail like a Fafnir mantichore that they won t even notice anything less  Might do some good  in the long run  Crown Prince Edvard will like your Space Vikings  He s much opposed to class distinctions and caste prejudices  Says they have to be eliminated before we can make democracy really work Why  it sounds like feudalism to me!
support of his great nobles; they owe theirs to their barons and landholding knights; they owe theirs to their people  There are limits beyond which none of them can go; after that  their vassals turn on them troops to support the baron royal city and hold the crown lands  the king has no troops  If he wants troops  he has to get them from his great nobles; they have to get them from their vassal barons  who raise them by calling out their people oppress his people; it might be their turn next You mean  the people are armed 
Great Satan  aren t yours 
sufferance  If their ballots aren t secured by arms  they re worthless  Who has the arms on your planet Why  the Government 
You mean the King 
The people can t; you just told me that they aren t armed  and the Government is And in the end 
property owner and the only employer on the planet  and everybody else would be slaves  working at assigned tasks  wearing Government-issued clothing and eating Government food  their children educated as the Government prescribes and trained for jobs selected for them by the Government  never reading a book or seeing a play or thinking a thought that the Government had not approved    legislate themselves into slavery They have something about like that on Aton 
Nationalist gang got into control fifty years ago  during the crisis after the war with Baldur    They were voted into power by the people  weren t they 
Yes; they were 
measure  and they were given emergency powers  Once they were in  they made the emergency permanent That couldn t happen on Marduk!
the next election Oh  then Marduk s safe! The sun ll go nova first

Your Majesty! I am most deeply honored!
Are you all right  Simon 
They haven t done anything to you  have they 
a comrade  Your Majesty  Have I your permission to present  informally  their commander  Prince Trask of Tanith Indeed you may  Simon  I owe the gentleman my deepest thanks 
His Majesty  Mikhyl the Eighth  Planetary King of Marduk 
of Tanith for his Majesty Angus the First of Gram of my kinsman Prince Bentrik  and then at the honor of meeting one in the confidence of my fellow sovereign King Angus of Gram  I will never be ungrateful for what you did for my cousin and for his officers and men  You must stay at the Palace while you are on this planet; I am giving orders for your reception  and I wish you to be formally presented to me this evening that is one of the Sword-Worlds  is it not Are you really a Space Viking  Prince Trask 
Nobody s going to be sticky about what happened on Audhumla 
mix you up in that  It s not only about the action on Audhumla; everybody from the Space Minister down wants to hear what you know about this fellow Dunnan  Like yourself  we all hope he went to Em-See-Square along with his flagship  but we can t take it for granted  We have over a dozen trade-planets to protect  and he s hit more than half of them already Look at that city!
civilized planets  but I never realized they were anything like this  Why  this makes Excalibur look like Tanith!more of them  If there were two billion people on Gram--which I hope there never will be--Gram would have cities like this  too I don t care how many people they have 
had  A wolf never cares how many sheep there are in a flock  With twenty ships  we could take this planet like we took Eglonsby  There d be losses coming in  sure  but after we were in and down  we d have it Where would we get twenty ships 
that nonsense Oh  let them rave 
waits  the more they ll be ridiculed when the facts are published daughter That s too close to take chances with him 
Simon  You ll have to be a spaceport spaceman from now on I shan t be sorry 
Prince Trask gratitude  I do Trask  my son wants to meet you  very badly  He s ten years old  and he thinks Space Vikings are romantic heroes He should be one  for a while 
cousin valued friend to me and my house 
ballroom You are quite the cynosure  you know 
and I can sit down  Your Majesty was the center of attention in the throne room  yet I seemed to detect a look of relief as you left it I try to hide it  as much as possible 
Majesty can be rather wearying  you know 
the evening  relaxing over our wine and tobacco Goodman Lucas Right  Goodman Mikhyl 
I hear a few hard things about your trade  Goodman Lucas 
robbers  as one of my fellow tradesmen says  The worst of it is that robbery and murder become just that: a trade  like servicing robots or selling groceries crippled  Victrix   Why sure whether you killed him or not can really trust  One or the other would stay wherever he has his base all the time And when you do kill him; what then 
later  I ll have one quarrel too many with King Angus  and then we will be our Majesty Lucas the First of Tanith  and we will sit on a throne and receive our subjects  And I ll be glad when I can get my crown off and talk to a few men who call me  shipmate   instead of  Your Majesty  subject to renounce his sovereign  of course  but that might be an excellent thing  You met the ambassador from Ithavoll at dinner  did you not  Three centuries ago  Ithavoll was a colony of Marduk--it seems we can t afford colonies  any more--and it seceded from us  Ithavoll was then a planet like your Tanith seems to be  Today  it is a civilized world  and one of Marduk s best friends  You know  sometimes I think a few lights are coming on again  here and there in the Old Federation  If so  you Space Vikings are helping to light them locals But they have to be used for civilized ends  Do you know anything about a Space Viking raid on Aton  over a century ago damaged and without booty nations; the two greatest were at the brink of war  and the others were waiting to pounce on the exhausted victor and then fight each other for the spoils  The Space Vikings forced them to unite  Out of that temporary alliance came the League for Common Defense  and from that the Planetary Republic  The Republic s a dictatorship  now  and just between Goodman Mikhyl and Goodman Lucas it s a nasty one and our Majesty s Government doesn t like it at all  It will be smashed sooner or later  but they ll never go back to divided sovereignty and nationalism again  The Space Vikings frightened them out of that when the dangers inherent in it couldn t  Maybe this man Dunnan will do the same for us on Marduk You have troubles 
You ve seen decivilized planets  How does it happen 
and industries  Survivors among ruins  too busy keeping their own bodies alive to try to keep civilization alive  Then they lose all knowledge of how to be civilized erosion  and while it s going on  nobody notices it  Everybody is proud of their civilization  their wealth and culture  But trade is falling off; fewer ships come in each year  So there is boastful talk about planetary self-sufficiency; who needs off-planet trade anyhow  Everybody seems to have money  but the government is always broke  Deficit spending--and always the vital social services for which the government has to spend money  The most vital one  of course  is buying votes to keep the government in power  And it gets harder for the government to get anything done    Trask closed his eyes  Again  he could feel the mellow sun of Gram on his back  and hear the laughing voices on the lower terrace  and he was talking to Lothar Ffayle and Rovard Grauffis and Alex Gorram and Cousin Nikkolay and Otto Harkaman  He said:   Mikhyl VIII looked across the low table at his guest     the King said

Permission to come aboard  sir 
you re just in time for second breakfast Is that a Sword-World robot  sir  or did you capture it somewhere 
It s one of our own 
it does some cooking on top  at the back that be a servant as nobles  servants of jobs You need all your people for fighting men  don t you 
five hundred men; most of them around eight hundred Of course  Most of them are ground-fighters 
I wish I were a Space Viking!
Navy  You re supposed to fight Space Vikings I won t fight you 
You d have to  if the King commanded 
No  Prince Trask is my friend  He saved my father s life 
fireworks  and then we ll each go home and claim victory  How would that be I ve heard of things like that 
with Odin  seventy years ago  that was mostly that sort of battles Besides  the King is Prince Trask s friend  too 
lie when they re on the Throne  do they Good Kings don t 
Ours is a good King 
My house owes Prince Trask a debt talk  Count Steven Prince Bentrik was surprised  That couldn t have been avoided  at the time shouldn t be allowed to happen many more times  though the time it ll take to get all the ships equipped as they come in detection system  Prince Trask though were informing Space Vikings about our technical secrets    We ll have to find out where the fellow has his base 
assume that he was on his flagship when you blew it  and just put paid to him and forget him went anywhere on the same ship  after he came out here and established a base  I think one of them would stay home all the time Well  we ll give you everything we have on them 
too  I just skimmed over the summary of what you gave us; I daresay we ll both get a lot of new information  Have you any idea at all where he might be based  Prince Trask Only that we think it s a non-Terra-type planet 
great deal Federation space-volume that are inhabitable in artificial environment  Including a few completely covered by seas  where you could put in underwater dome cities if you had the time and material What I should like to know 
of a Dunnan knew we d have a ship on Audhumla just when we did I don t think he just pulled that planet out of a hat and then went there prepared to sit on the bottom of the ocean for a year and a half waiting for something to turn up  I think he knew the  Victrix  was coming to Audhumla  and just about when I don t like that  commodore 
You think I do  sir 
is  though  We all have to face it We do 
caution you to screen everybody you put onto it very carefully the Navy s had anything like this to worry about I must Prince Edvard s  I mean Baron Cragdale s  hunting lodge We ll be going there directly from here 
Ah 
Well  we ll keep in contact  Prince Trask 
time  Prince Trask  She is precisely eight years old; I saw her getting ready for bed before I came down here  I ll look in on her after dinner that sort of thing Well  we don t use the word government very much 
talk a lot about authority and sovereignty  and I m afraid we burn entirely too much powder over it  but government always seems to us like sovereignty interfering in matters that don t concern it  As long as sovereignty maintains a reasonable semblance of good public order and makes the more serious forms of crime fairly hazardous for the criminals  we re satisfied positive for the people word--doesn t do anything for the people!individual lord or baron And the people have no voice at all; why  that s tyranny 
people do that for themselves  The government  if you want to think of it as that  just sees to it that nobody s shooting at them while they re doing it pensions whooping for uninhabited planet rescued  all three were immensely wealthy  from trading hats with each other  That s about the way this thing will work to civilized society on Marduk I m inclined to agree with Prince Trask 
Makann now May I put it on  to show you what I mean 
The Ministries are full of them! They are all traitors! The bloodthirsty reactionaries of the falsely so-called Crown Loyalist Party! The grasping conspiracy of the interstellar bankers! The dirty Gilgameshers! They are all leagued together in an unholy conspiracy! And now this Space Viking  this bloody-handed monster from the Sword-Worlds    Shut the horrible man off 
 Makann! Makann! Makann the Leader! Makann to Power! 
You even let him have a private army 
Oh  those silly buffoons and their musical-comedy uniforms 
They aren t armed 
Not visibly 
Not yet 
I don t know where they d get arms 
No  Your Highness 
That s what I m worried about 
XXII

Hello  both of you 
Don t  Mopsy  We want to talk to this gentleman 
Are you really and truly the Space Viking 
Really and truly  And who are you two 
I m Myrna  And this is Mopsy 
Hello  Myrna  Hello  Mopsy 
Mopsy likes you 
I like you  too 
And I like you 
a Space Viking has to have a girl on every planet  How would you like to be my girl on Marduk You see  I m going to have to be Queen  some day Oh 
will have to be King  and then when he s through being King  I can t be King because I m a girl  so I ll have to be Queen  And I can t be anybody s girl  because I m going to have to marry somebody I don t know  for reasons of state I ll tell you a secret  I am a Queen now 
Oh  you are 
our Royal Playroom  and our Royal Bathroom  And Mopsy is our faithful subject Is Your Majesty absolute ruler of these domains 
No 
Ministers  just like Grandpa has to  That means  I have to do just what they tell me to  That s Lady Valerie  and Margot  and Dame Eunice  and Sir Thomas  But Grandpa says they are good and wise ministers  Are you really a Prince  I didn t know Space Vikings were Princes you a secret  I don t have to do what anybody tells me you ve slain just hundreds of cruel and wicked enemies Thousands  Your Majesty 
But you feel bad about it 
want to do being King for just years and years Lessons  I bet Lady Valerie and who else 
Margot  She s my nurse  She s awful strict  but she s nice 
Prince Trask  has Her Highness been bothering you 
Oh  far from it 
is sovereign of three princely domains  And of one dear loving subject You should not have told Prince Trask that 
incognito  Now  Your Majesty must go with the Minister of the Bedchamber; the Minister of Education awaits an audience you again  Say good-by  Mopsy I came out to enjoy the gardens alone 
I d rather enjoy them in company  If your Ministerial duties do not forbid  could you be the company affairs of state  Square root  Have you seen the grottoes  They re down this way informal discussions about co-operation against this mutual enemy of ours  Dunnan  This is fine; it has my approval  and the approval of Prince Vandarvant  the Prime Minister  and  I might add  that of Goodman Mikhyl  I think it ought to go further  though  A formal treaty between Tanith and Marduk would be greatly to the advantage of both proposing marriage on rather short acquaintance  It s only been fifty hours since the  Nemesis  orbited in here a large Gilgamesher colony here  You have a few on Tanith  haven t you  Well  anything one Gilgamesher knows  they all find out  and ours are co-operative with Naval intelligence advantageous  I d be quite in favor of it  Co-operation against Dunnan  of course  and reciprocal trade-rights on each other s trade-planets  and direct trade between Marduk and Tanith  And Beowulf and Amaterasu would come into it  too  Does this also have the approval of the Prime Minister and the King and the King  as you ll have noticed  The King can t be in favor of anything till the Assembly or the Chancellor express an opinion  Prince Vandarvant favors it personally; as Prime Minister  he is reserving his opinion  We ll have to get the support of the Crown Loyalist Party before he can take an unequivocal position we just work out a rough outline of what this treaty ought to be  and then consult  unofficially  with a few people whom you can trust  and see what can be done about presenting it to the proper government officials    Controversial 
every general election  On this planet  you can always kick the Gilgameshers and the Armed Forces with impunity  neither have votes and neither can kick back  The whole thing ll be forgotten the day after the election  It always is That s if Makann doesn t win the election 
get along without the Navy  and they bloody well know it Audhumla  no at least a thousand people  from myself down to the shoeshine boys  could have known about it as soon as the order was taped     Skathi as junk a century ago and tinkered up by the locals  She was in here twice  according to the commercial shipping records  and the second time she was in too bad shape to be moved out  and Sasstroff couldn t pay to have her rebuilt  so she was libeled for spaceport charges and sold  Some one-lung trading company bought her and fixed her up a little; they went bankrupt in a year or so  and she was bought by another small company  Startraders  Ltd   and they ve been using her on a milk-run to and from Gimli  They seem to be a legitimate outfit  but we re looking into them  We re looking for Sasstroff  too  but we haven t been able to find him there knows anything about her  You may discover that she hasn t been going there at all We might  at that 
We ll just find out 
Do you think it would be wise 
lunatics would pick it up and twist it into evidence of some kind of a sinister plot Oh  I believe Her Majesty could sign a treaty with Prince Trask 
very secret Gee!
wicked rulers of the old dictatorship!I ll bet Grandpa doesn t even have any secret treaties!
SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME! SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME!
SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME! SPACE VI-KING--GO HOME!
Fire!
fire now!Those police were murdered 
man who ordered them out there unarmed That would be Count Naydnayr  the Minister of Security 
Then he s the one you want to hang for it 
What else would you have done 
machine-gun fire as soon as the mob crossed it  and kept on firing till the survivors turned tail and ran  Then sent out more cars  and shot everybody wearing a People s Watchmen uniform  all over town  Inside forty-eight hours  there d be no People s Welfare party  and no Zaspar Makann either things in the Sword-Worlds  Prince Trask  It s not the way we do things here on Marduk  Our government does not propose to be guilty of shedding the blood of its people Marduk  You could have made almost anything of it  But it s too late now  You ve torn down the gates; the barbarians are in 
XXIII

Traskon  any more  Traskon is now the personal property of our well loved--very well loved--Queen Evita  The Trasks don t own enough land on Gram now for a family cemetery  You see what you did helped put Angus on the throne  and it would have been about the same in the end It could be a lot different 
your ships and men back to Gram and put yourself on the throne renounce my allegiance to Angus  I can trade on Morglay or Joyeuse or Flamberge just as easily Count Lionel and Duke Joris are both defying Angus; they ve refused to furnish him men  they ve driven out his tax collectors  those they haven t hanged  and they re building ships of their own  Angus is building ships  too  I don t know whether he s going to use them to fight Bigglersport and Newhaven  or attack you  but there s going to be a war before another year s out All right 
bring that ship back under Angus of Wardshaven s charter and we ll fire on her Just call yourself Prince of Tanith 
make any difference in your authority here  and if you do lay claim to the throne of Gram  nobody can say you re a foreign king trying to annex the planet King of Gram Why  yes 
Secondhand booty  I raided Dagon for it 
Barragon s ships were raiding one of our planets 
of the locals  I found out about it from Captain Ravallo of the  Black Star   on Indra; he d just been from Ganpat  Beowulf wasn t too far out of the way  so we put in there  and found the  Grendelsbane  just ready to space out joined us  and the three of us went to Dagon  We blew up one of Barragon s ships  and put the other one down out of commission  and then we sacked his base  There was a Gilgamesher colony there; we didn t bother them  They ll tell what we did  and why That should furnish Prince Viktor of Xochitl something to ponder 
Where are the other ships  now 
to do a little trading on the way  The  Black Star  went to Xochitl  Just a friendly visit  to say hello to Prince Viktor for you  Ravallo has a lot of audiovisuals we made during the Dagon Operation  Then she s going to Jagannath to visit Nikky Gratham our own industries  we can produce what we need  and we can trade with Beowulf and Amaterasu  and with Xochitl and Jagannath and Hoth  if we can make any sort of agreement with them; everybody agrees to let everybody else s trade-planets alone  It s too bad you couldn t get some kind of an agreement with Marduk will probably be raiding Marduk You think it ll be like that 
are rising; they have a leader  and they re uniting  Every society rests on a barbarian base  The people who don t understand civilization  and wouldn t like it if they did  The hitchhikers  The people who create nothing  and who don t appreciate what others have created for them  and who think civilization is something that just exists and that all they need to do is enjoy what they can understand of it--luxuries  a high living standard  and easy work for high pay  Responsibilities  Phooey! What do they have a government for the car than the people who designed it  so they re going to grab the controls  Zaspar Makann says they can  and he s the Leader understand it  though  I was reading about Hitler  on the way home  I wouldn t be surprised if Zaspar Makann had been reading about Hitler  too  He s using all Hitler s tricks  But Hitler came to power in a country which had been impoverished by a military defeat  Marduk hasn t fought a war in almost two generations  and that one was a farce the ruling class of his nation  the people who kept things running  were discredited  The masses  the homemade barbarians  didn t have anybody to take their responsibilities for them  What they have on Marduk is a ruling class that has been discrediting itself  A ruling class that s ashamed of its privileges and shirks its duties  A ruling class that has begun to believe that the masses are just as good as they are  which they manifestly are not  And a ruling class that won t use force to maintain its position  And they have a democracy  and they are letting the enemies of democracy shelter themselves behind democratic safeguards the word for it their power  and our people aren t hitchhikers  and as long as they get decent treatment they don t try to run things  And we re not doing so well one of them--Napolyon of Flamberge  Rodolf of Excalibur  or Angus of about half of Gram--who is devoted to civilization or anything else outside himself  and that s the mark of the barbarian What are you devoted to  Otto 
You  You are my chieftain  That s another mark of the barbarian 
So that s it 
election and they re afraid to antagonize anybody who might have a vote  So the Navy had to drop the investigation  Everybody on Marduk s scared of this Makann  You think there might be some tie-up between him and Dunnan trade-planets since the Battle of Audhumla couple of Mardukan ships there  and they had the  Victrix  fixed up enough to do some fighting  They ran the  Bolide  out Mardukan Navy ship came in  They were glad to see me; it saved them sending off a pinnace for Tanith  They had news for you  and a couple of passengers Passengers 
anybody with side-whiskers and buttoned-up coats see them What those people know gets all over the place before long 
and impose myself and Steven on you  Prince Trask he insisted  We spent the whole voyage to Gimli concealed in the captain s quarters; only a few of the officers knew we were aboard Makann won the election  Is that it 
doesn t want to risk you and Steven being used as hostages That s it 
might as well have  Nobody has a majority of seats in the Chamber of Representatives but he s formed a coalition with several of the splinter parties  and I m ashamed to say that a number of Crown Loyalist members--Crowd of Disloyalists  I call them--are voting with him  now  They ve coined some ridiculous phrase about the  wave of the future   whatever that means If you can t lick them  join them 
If you can t lick them  lick their boots 
My son is a trifle bitter 
to a trace of bitterness  too Well  that s the Representatives 
of the government majority of seats in the Delegates  Most of them would have indignantly denied  a month before  having any connection with Makann  but a hundred out of a hundred and twenty are his supporters  Makann  of course  is Chancellor And who is Prime Minister 
Andray Dunnan 
The Prime Minister is Crown Prince Edvard  No; Baron Cragdale  That isn t a royal title  so by some kind of a fiction I can t pretend to understand he is not Prime Minister as a member of the Royal Family If you can t    
believes  very sincerely  that the election was an expression of the will of the people  and that it is his duty to bow to it just small arms; combat vehicles and heavy weapons  As soon as the new government was formed  they were given status as a part of the Planetary Armed Forces  They have taken over every police station on the planet And the King 
else can he do  We ve been whittling down and filching away the powers of the Throne for the last three centuries that you two would be used as hostages He s going to fight 
Maybe as a guerrilla in the mountains  I don t know  But if he can t lick them  he won t join them  I wanted to stay with him and help him; he told me I could help him best by placing myself and Steven where he wouldn t worry about us I wanted to stay 
But he said that I must take care of Mother  And if he were killed  I must be able to avenge him You talk like a Sword-Worlder; I told you that once before 
Princess Myrna and Lady Valerie 
They re at Cragdale; they ll be safe there  I hope 

XXIV

Prince Viktor s fire see a lot of good firemen around  If there is a battle you will see that Steven s in a safe place  won t you In a space attack  there are no safe places  I ll keep him with me 
Well  you won t be on any ship  Count  You ll be on my staff 
Marduk doesn t like us  any more 
ships on all their trade-planets  and they all have orders to fire on any  repeat any  Space Vikings  including the ships of the self-styled Prince of Tanith  I got this from Captain Garravay of the  Vindex   After we were through talking  we fought a nice little ship-to-ship action for him to make films of  I don t think anybody could see anything wrong with it This order came from Makann 
retired on account of quote ill-health unquote  He is now in a quote hospital unquote Where s Prince Bentrik 
and he just vanished  Gone underground  or secretly arrested and executed; take your choice of them  That isn t to catch Dunnan  That s to disperse the Navy away from Marduk  They don t trust the Navy  Is Prince Edvard still Prime Minister in a scrupulously legal manner  outside of making his People s Watchmen part of the armed forces  Protesting his devotion to the King every time he opens his mouth When will the fire be  I wonder 
Probably happened by now The whole thing s just a big Gilgamesher lie 
himself--paid them to tell us that  to pin our ships down here  Or they made it up themselves  so they could make hay on our trade-planets Let s go down to the Ghetto and clean out the whole gang 
Anything one of them s in  they re all in together 
Nifflheim with that; let s all space out for Xochitl 
we have enough to lick them on their own planet Prince Trask; I must speak to you as soon as possible 
It is of the first importance 
it s of the first importance  the sooner you tell me about it    you can command  Satan only knows what s happening there now  but three thousand hours ago  when the Duke sent me off  Omfray of Glaspyth was landing on Wardshaven  He has a fleet of eight ships  furnished to him by his wife s kinsman  the King of Haulteclere  They are commanded by King Konrad s Space Viking cousin  the Prince of Xochitl Angus--the former King Angus  or maybe even the late King Angus  I suppose he is now--but a murderer like Omfray of Glaspyth    You don t want to do either  do you 
what would happen if we did that planet-holders like Gratham and the Everrards would combine against us and make a slag-pile out of Tanith Viktor s kept his ships away from our planets  If we attacked Xochitl now  without provocation  nobody d know what to expect from us  People like Nikky Gratham and Tobbin of Nergal and the Everrards of Hoth get nervous around unpredictable dangers  and when they get nervous they get trigger-happy Then you ll be going back to Gram 
crowd are wrong doesn t make Valpry and Rathmore and Ffayle right  You heard what I was telling those very people at Karvall House  the day I met you  And you ve seen what s been happening on Gram since we came out here  Otto  the Sword-Worlds are finished; they re half decivilized now  Civilization is alive and growing here on Tanith  I want to stay here and help it grow Look  Lucas 
the Admiral  But I m telling you; you ll have to do something  or this whole setup of yours will fall apart  As it stands  you can attack Xochitl and the Back-To-Gram party would go along  or you can decide on this crusade against Omfray of Glaspyth and the Raid-Xochitl-Now party would go along  But if you let this go on much longer  you won t have any influence over either party finished won t raid Xochitl; I told you why  and you agreed  And I won t spend the men and ships and wealth of Tanith in any Sword-World dynastic squabble  Great Satan  Otto; you were in the Durendal War  This is the same thing  and it ll go on for another half a century Then what will you do 
I came out here after Andray Dunnan  didn t I 
won t be as interested in Dunnan as you are Hitler  coming in from Marduk  I will tell them all a big lie  Such a big lie that nobody will dare to disbelieve it 
XXV

Do you think I was afraid of Viktor of Xochitl 
a dozen ships; we could make a new Van Allen belt around Tanith of them  with what we have here  Our real enemy is on Marduk  not Xochitl; his name s Zaspar Makann  Zaspar Makann  and Andray Dunnan  the man I came out from Gram to hunt; they re in alliance  and I believe Dunnan is on Marduk  himself  now Well  here; we don t know anything about this Zaspar Makann 
No  you don t 
and listen  till you find out a little about him we were hunting for him I wouldn t be surprised 
Dunnan  was  Zaspar Makann  I know he doesn t look like Dunnan  we all saw him on screen  but there s such a thing as plastic surgery five years ago  That would be about the time Dunnan would have arrived on Marduk and all the time and money we ve invested in it  to go back to Gram and pull your chestnuts out of the fire  Gehenna with you! We re staying here and defending our own planet  If you re smart  you ll stay here with us but safe and well How are you 
way For all I know  she s Queen of Marduk  now our planet give you and took over And  of course  they elected Makann Chancellor; that did it 
Representatives have been arrested  on all kinds of ridiculous charges--sex-crimes  receiving bribes  being in the pay of foreign powers  nothing too absurd  Then they rammed through a law empowering the Chancellor to fill vacancies in the Chamber of Representatives by appointment Why did the Crown Prince lend himself to a thing like that 
is an almost holy symbol to the people  Even Makann was forced to pretend loyalty to the King and the Crown Prince    It didn t work; he played right into Makann s hands  What happened 
You weren t just sitting on your hands  were you 
Oh  no 
thought myself capable of  a few years ago  Organizing a mutineering conspiracy in the Royal Mardukan Navy  After Admiral Shefter was forcibly retired and shut up in an insane asylum  I disappeared and turned into a civilian contragravity-lifter operator at the Malverton Navy Yard  Finally  when I was suspected  one of the officers--he was arrested and tortured to death later--managed to smuggle me onto a lighter for the Moonbase  I was an orderly in the hospital there  The day the Crown Prince was murdered  we had a mutiny of our own  We killed everybody we even suspected of being a Makannist  The Moonbase has been under attack from the planet ever since We ll talk about this later  There are some people here    
Dunnan is working with Zaspar Makann  and as soon as Makann consolidates his position he s sending an expedition against Tanith How in blazes did you find that out  here 
From the Gilgameshers 
Prince Trask 
Valerie!
you here Welcome to Tanith  Your Highness!glad to see you  There s been such awful things happened!among friends; friends with whom you have a treaty  Remember play-Queen  And now I know what they meant when they talked about when Grandpa and Pappa would be through being King  Pappa didn t even get to be King!Lady Valerie  will you come with us 
quarters for Princess Myrna Is it Princess Myrna  or is it Queen Myrna 
when we left Moonbase  but that was five hundred hours ago  We don t know anything about her mother  either  She was at the Palace when Prince Edvard was murdered; we ve heard absolutely nothing about her  The King made a few screen appearances  parroting things Makann wanted him to say  Under hypnosis  That was probably the very least of what they did to him  They ve turned him into a zombi Well  how did Myrna get to Moonbase 
Kobbly  and Captain Rainer  They armed the servants at Cragdale with hunting rifles and everything else they could scrape up  captured Prince Edvard s space-yacht  and took off in her  Took a couple of hits from ground batteries getting off  and from ships around Moonbase getting in  Ships of the Royal Mardukan Navy!They sent the yacht off to Gimli 
they ll try to rally as many of the Royal Navy units as haven t gone over to Makann  They re to assemble on Gimli and await my return  If I don t return in fifteen hundred hours from the time I left Moonbase  they re to use their own judgment  I d expect that they d move in on Marduk and attack That s sixty-odd days 
time to expect that lunar base to hold out  against a whole planet Marduk was fighting a combination of six other planets  It held out against continuous attack  once  for almost a year  It s been constantly strengthened ever since And what have they to throw at it 
over to Makann  Four fifteen-hundred-footers  same class as the  Victrix   and two thousand-footers  Then  there were four of Andray Dunnan s ships--You mean  he really is on Marduk 
Yes:  Fortuna    Bolide   and two armed merchantmen  a Baldurbuilt ship called the  Reliable   and your friend  Honest Horris  You didn t really believe Dunnan was on Marduk 
those people out of that crusade against Omfray of Glaspyth I m not surprised  We decided  long ago  that Dunnan was planning to raid Marduk  It appears that we underestimated him  Maybe he was reading about Hitler  too  He wasn t planning any raid; he was planning conquest  in the only way a great civilization can be conquered--by subversion Yes 
programme  who was this Makann  anyhow Nobody 
a coven of fellow-crackpots  who met in the back room of a saloon and had their office in a cigar box  The next year  he had a suite of offices and was buying time on a couple of telecasts  The year after that  he had three telecast stations of his own  and was holding rallies and meetings of thousands of people  And so on  upward Makann moved in behind the King  And Dunnan will have him shot the way he had Prince Edvard shot  and use the murder as a pretext to liquidate his personal followers out of hyperspace on Tanith and smash him now  while he s still little enough to smash The  Nemesis   the  Corisande   and the  Space Scourge  for sure 
possible  We don t know how many ships will be gathered there  but we don t want them wasted in detail-attacks  Tell whoever s in command there that ships from Tanith are on the way  and to wait for them Even after we get through arguing about it  Argument is not exclusively a feature of democracies 
It isn t a Space Viking fleet 
are only three Space Vikings in it  The rest are the ships of three civilized planets  Tanith  Beowulf and Amaterasu Marduk  or Baldur or Odin  or    Well  aren t you 
We  are  Space Vikings!
with the Neobarbarians of Zaspar Makann Well  I won t argue the last half of it  Steven 
Are you people done yakking about who s civilized and who isn t 
ready to jump Jumping 
We think we ve figured out where Dunnan s base is 
Oh  good!
Where s yours 
Abaddon 
the Marduk system checking our outside planets to see if Prince Viktor might be hiding on one of them  Well  what with the time element  and the way the  Honest Horris  was shuttling back and forth from Marduk to some place that wasn t Gimli  and the way Dunnan was able to bring his ships in as soon as the shooting started on Marduk  we thought he must be on an uninhabited outer planet of the Marduk system I don t know why we never thought of that  ourselves 
It s only a small planet  about four thousand miles in diameter  and it s three and a half billion miles from primary  It s frozen solid  It would take almost a year to get to it on Abbot drive  and if your ship has Dillinghams  why not take a little longer and go to a good planet  So nobody bothered with Abaddon No 
strategy is decided Well  how about the Mardukan Navy 
Fleet Admiral Bargham s in command at Gimli He may be  at present  but he won t be when I get there  I will be 
commodore know dead  The Crown Prince is dead  The Princess Myrna is a child  I am assuming the position of Regent and Prince-Protector of the Realm 
XXVI

That s Zaspar Makann and his stooges you re talking about 
Well  the Constitution    
chosen by election  Even members of the Royal Family can t just make themselves Regent by saying they are more elections  at least for the present  Not till we make sure the people of Marduk can be trusted with the control of the government navy battleships and four other craft attacking them other trade-planets  but I haven t heard from any of them  We can t go there with only four ships Sixteen ships 
we re using for a troopship  I think that s enough  You ll remain here on Gimli  in any case  admiral; as soon as the other ships come in  you ll follow to Marduk with them  I am now holding a meeting aboard the Tanith flagship  Nemesis   I want your four ship-commanders aboard immediately  I am not including you because you re remaining here to bring up the late comers and as soon as this meeting is over we are spacing out Go on in 
within a mile if necessary  They could be hiding somewhere on it sure Simon Bentrik  Prince-Protector of Marduk  calling Moonbase 
Moonbase; this is Simon Bentrik  Prince-Protector  speaking Prince-Protector thing Somebody had to do it  Is the King still alive 
know what it was like--urging everybody to obey and co-operate with  our trusted Chancellor   Makann always appeared on the screen with him I remember 
speech  After a while  the King wasn t able to speak coherently; he d stammer  and repeat  So then Makann did all the talking; they couldn t even depend on him to parrot what they were giving him with an earplug phone  Then he stopped appearing entirely  I suppose there were physical symptoms they couldn t allow to be seen I hope for his sake that he is dead 
So do I 
you left  Fortuna   We blew out the Malverton Navy Yard  They re still using the Antarctic Naval Base  but we ve knocked out a good deal of that  We got the  Honest Horris   They made two attempts to land on us and lost a couple of ships  Eight hundred hours ago  they were joined by the rest of Dunnan s fleet  five ships  They made a landing on Malverton while it was turned away from us  Makann announced that they were RMN units from the trade-planets that had joined him  I suppose the planet-side public swallowed that  He also announced that their commander  Admiral Dunnan  was in command of the People s Armed Forces stick they Mardukan Navy ships  Champion  and  Guardian   There are five orbiting off the planet: Ex-RMNS  Paladin   and Dunnan ships  Starhopper    Banshee    Reliable  and  Exporter   The last two are listed as merchantmen  but they re performing like regulation battlecraft All right  we have to take all our bad eggs in one basket 
Try to hit them as soon after they join as possible 
traitors first! Scratch one traitor!
There went one of ours 
Where s the  Black Star  
Gone to Em-See-Square 
Dunnan-Makanns   Bolide  and  Reliable  Here comes the  Starhopper  again!
Tell him to wait a moment; we have troubles 
We just lost one of our Mardukans 
that got her looks like the  Banshee ; I m turning to engage her Which way; west around the planet  Be right with you  captain 

XXVII

of those ships would have been destroyed  without anybody seeing it happen the battle together and headed in for the planet  They didn t come here to help liberate Marduk  they came here to fill their cargo holds  I only hope the people they re robbing all voted the Makann ticket in the last election will be Makann s storm-troops and Dunnan s pirates; they ll be the ones to get killed We don t want any more killing than    
Edvard blood was shed  If they re doing what you think they are  I m afraid we ll have to kill a few of your Space Vikings  too They aren t my Space Vikings 
fighting them till the main war s over  Those three shiploads are no worse than a bad cold; Makann and Dunnan are the plague he is your King; if he is not  I am your Queen  and until I am old enough to rule in my own right  I accept Prince Simon as Regent and Protector of the Realm  and I call on all of you to obey him as I will democracy  or the constitution the use of the word  rule   instead of  reign  That s right 
something wrong with democracy  If there weren t  it couldn t be overthrown by people like Makann  attacking it from within by democratic procedures  I don t think it s fundamentally unworkable  I think it just has a few of what engineers call bugs  It s not safe to run a defective machine till you learn the defects and remedy them bugs It may just be 
unworkable about government itself  As long as  Homo sapiens terra  is a wild animal  which he has always been and always will be until he evolves into something different in a million or so years  maybe a workable system of government is a political science impossibility  just as transmutation of elements was a physical-science impossibility as long as they tried to do it by chemical means it breaks down  hope the next try will work a little better  for a little longer You re not going 
about taking care of myself    You re to stay aboard  Count 
stabilize  Princess Myrna will have to come down  You ll act as her personal escort  And don t think you re being shoved into the background  She s Crown Princess  and if she isn t Queen now  she will be in a few years  Escorting her now will be the foundation of your naval career  There isn t a young officer in the Royal Navy who wouldn t trade places with you That was the right way to handle him  Lucas 
It ll do just what I said for him 
be Queen in a few years  if she isn t now  Queens need Prince Consorts  Your son s a good boy; I liked him the first moment I saw him  and I ve liked him better ever since  He d be a good man on the throne beside Queen Myrna they re about a sixteenth cousin  But people would say I was abusing the Protectorship to marry my son onto the Throne to learn  You ve learned one important lesson already  that a ruler must be willing to use force and shed blood to enforce his rule  You have to learn  too  that a ruler cannot afford to be guided by his fears of what people will say about him  Not even what history will say about him  A ruler s only judge is himself have to talk it over with     with my only judge  Well  let s go expedition! man hiding behind that  You know what this is  don t you 
a veridicator  That globe ll light blue; the moment you try to lie to us  it ll turn red  And the moment it turns red  I m going to hammer your teeth down your throat with the butt of this pistol Have you found anything out about the King  yet 
than a month ago about him  He just disappeared He s dead 
him and used him as a ventriloquist s dummy on the screen as long as they could; when they couldn t let the people see him any more  they stuffed him into a converter We ll have to have something done about that 
didn t think he d do just this  I thought he wanted to abolish the Throne  not sit on it me any Space Viking captain can control his crew  These men didn t come here to correct the political mistakes of Marduk  They came here for what they could haul away  I could get myself killed trying to stop them now    I wouldn t even try 
I came here for what I could make out of this planet  myself 
You can try to stop them 
You ll find it even harder than what you re doing now 
Could you talk your people into going to some other city 
be fine looting  Drepplin The people there are Mardukan subjects  too 
By all means  gentlemen  Take your men to Drepplin  and nobody will object to anything you do aground there  Captain Esthersan  You know what all Dunnan left there Says she knows where the King is     I m sorry  Your Highness; Dowager Crown Princess     have been taking care of him  the best way we could  If you ll only come quickly    Prince Bentrik! And it s Prince Trask of Tanith!
care of  Please alive  I don t know how long  That s our professional duty  But it s no kindness to His Majesty Is Prince Lucas Trask of Tanith here 
anybody else now we ve disarmed him and are holding him  If we turn him over to you  will you let us go you  the rest of you will be let outside this building and allowed to go away unharmed All right  We ll be coming out in a minute 
It s agreed!
Bring him out 
couldn t rule without me  and neither can you gang of turncoats  and I ll rule Marduk for you Who are you 
I don t know you 
I am Lucas Trask  You ve heard that name before 
away from behind him  you people Karvall  Well  you won t  Lord Trask of Traskon  She loves me  not you  She s waiting for me now  on Gram    Take that carrion and stuff it in a mass-energy converter 
to me again

Thirty minutes to Litchfield  sir 
That s everything  Not many passengers left aboard  are there 
the lower deck end of the run I know  I was born there 
of freight lately  I guess I don t have to tell you about Litchfield labor trouble now Labor trouble 
farm-tramps  Ten of them for every job  if you call that trouble lower deck  and all your crewmen are armed  Not just pistols  either Oh  That s on account of pirates 
Pirates 
like farm-tramps; they ll have tommy guns and sawed-off shotguns in their bindles  When the ship s airborne and out of reach of help  they ll break out their guns and take her  Usually kill all the crew and passengers  They don t like to leave live witnesses You heard about the  Harriet Barne   didn t you 
They didn t pirate her  did they 
just a tag end of a radio call  that ended in a shot  Time the Air Patrol got to her estimated position it was too late  Nobody s ever seen ship  officers  crew or passengers since Well  great Ghu; isn t the Government doing anything about it 
there hasn t been a single case of piracy inside the city limits of Storisende Poictesme
Hey! Zarathustra sunstone! Nice 
Where is he  Sis 
Oh  emergency 
anything  In Tramptown  of course  But he ll be at the party     Oops  I shouldn t have said that; that s supposed to be a surprise Don t worry; I ll be surprised 
we all are to see him back     Now  Franz  put away the recorder; save the interview for the  Chronicle  till later  Ah  Professor Kellton; one pupil Litchfield Academy can be proud of!Conn  what did you find out 
is Hello  boy 
Good to see you again 
It sure is  Conn 
Find out anything definite 
We didn t have much time  Conn 
arranged a little celebration for you  We ll start it with a dinner at Senta s have to have a meal at Senta s before I d really feel at home in the meantime  Give the ladies a chance to fix up for the party  and have a little drink and a talk together You want to do that  Conn 
Yes  of course  I d like that 
Good melon crop this year 
melons  This time next year we ll be washing our feet in brandy drink of Poictesme brandy on Terra This isn t Terra  and we aren t selling it by the drink 
freighter captains pay us  You ve been away too long  Conn  You ve forgotten what it s like to live in a poor-house This our stuff 
Where did you dig it 
over back of Snagtooth  in the Calders  Everybody knows that was cleaned out years ago  Well  always take a second look at these things everybody knows  Ten to one they re not so  It always bothered me that nobody found any underground attack-shelters  I took a second look  and sure enough  I found them  right underneath  mined out of the solid rock  Conn  you d be surprised at what I found there Where are you going to sell that stuff 
private army for every man  woman and child in Poictesme some of the planets that were colonized right before the War and haven t gotten industrialized yet  I m clearing about two hundred sols a ton on it 
II

Well  gentlemen 
returned friend and new associate  Conn  we re all anxious to hear what you ve found out  but even if you didn t learn anything  we re still happy to have you back with us  Gentlemen; to our friend and neighbor  Welcome home  Conn!Well  it s wonderful to be back  Mr  Fawzi 
And drink up  everybody  We have plenty of brandy  if we don t have anything else You can say that again  Kurt 
and fermented    ferments Or why 
paying for wine Oh  please 
and is going to tell us how we can solve all our problems Yes  Conn 
where Merlin is  didn t you I hope 
the map  where the computer is buried But it s still here on Poictesme  isn t it 
They didn t take it away with them 
Most of you gentlemen 
on Terra  to study cybernetics and computer theory  It wouldn t do us any good to find Merlin if none of us could operate it  Well  I ve done that  I can use any known type of computer  and train assistants  After I graduated  I was offered a junior instructorship to computer physics at the University You didn t mention that  son 
think it was very important I think it is 
of my boys from the Academy offered a place on the faculty of the University of Montevideo  on Terra!Conn means 
Merlin used during the War by the Third Fleet-Army Force  code-named Merlin  I went over all the records available to the public; I used your letter  Professor  and the head of our Modern History department secured me access to non-public material  some of it still classified  For one thing  I have locations and maps and plans of every Federation installation built here between 842 and 854  the whole period of the War undiscovered; most of the important installations were built in duplicate  sometimes triplicate  as a precaution against space attack  I know where all of them are Space attack!
could have attacked Poictesme  Even if we d had the ships  we were fighting a purely defensive war  Aggression was no part of our policy--that  with all I was able to learn  I could find nothing  not one single word  about any giant strategic planning computer called Merlin  or any Merlin Project Nothing  Conn 
Of course  it was the most closely guarded secret    
But after forty years    
Hah  don t tell me about security!
should have seen the lengths our staff went to  I remember  once  on Mephistopheles    But there  was  a computer code-named Merlin 
memory-bank contained all human knowledge  It was capable of scanning all its data instantaneously  and combining  and forming associations  and reasoning with absolute accuracy  and extrapolating to produce new facts  and predicting future events  and    Is there a God 
Present 
We d have won the War  except for Merlin 
Merlin have to be of a hundred thousand cubic feet  For all Merlin was supposed to do  I d say something of the order of three million to five million   Dawes  the banker  said    Tom Brangwyn said  
 out    Lorenzo Menardes asked  
 objected   Conn was lifting his glass to his lips  He set it down again and rose to his feet    he said  
  Judge Ledue said  
  Conn replied  
 He went on talking  about remote controls and radio transmission and positronic brains and neutrino-circuits  They believed it all  even the little they understood  They would believe anything he told them about Merlin--except the truth    Lester Dawes said  
  Judge Ledue began  
  That was one of Klem Zareff s fellow planters  
  Rodney Maxwell finished the brandy in his glass and set it on the table  then went to the pile of belts and holsters and began rummaging for his own  Kurt Fawzi looked up in surprise    settled the belt over his hips   he asked

of it  I even caught myself starting to believe it once or twice them the truth  son didn t I just grab a couple of pistols and shoot the lot of them have hurt as much There is no Merlin  Is that it 
couldn t You re sure of it 
ought to know  The man who commanded the Third Force here during the War Foxx Travis!
once  when I was eight years old  I thought he d died long ago  Why  he must be over a hundred keeps him alive And you talked to him 
Yes 
What did he tell you 
keeper  He ll have a squad of doctors and a platoon of nurses in here as soon as you re gone  so take your time  Now  tell me how things are on Poictesme    Just about that 
an old legend people still talked about  I was ashamed to admit anybody really believed in it  He laughed  and said   Great Ghu  is that thing still around  Well  I suppose so; it was all through the Third Force during the War  Lord only knows how these rumors start among troops  We never contradicted it; it was good for morale  Conn  they wouldn t have believed you  and  Foxx Travis 
something they can shove all their problems onto  As soon as they find Merlin  everybody will be rich and happy  the Government bonds will be redeemed at face value plus interest  the paper money ll be worth a hundred Federation centisols to the sol  and the leaves and wastepaper will be raked off the Mall  all by magic I didn t know you were the village atheist  Father 
himself  I have to do business with these Merlinolators  It s all I can do to keep Flora from antagonizing them at school Flora s not a True Believer  then 
I d say  You know about him just couldn t believe in it  I don t blame him  I ve heard about it all my life  and I can t Why not 
everybody believes  Then  I ve had to do some studying on the Third Force occupation of Poictesme to know where to go and dig  and I never found any official  or even reliably unofficial  mention of anything of the sort  Forty years is a long time to keep a secret  you know  And I can t see why they didn t come back for it after the pressure to get the troops home was off  or why they didn t build a dozen Merlins  This isn t the only planet that has problems they can t solve for themselves What s Mother s attitude on Merlin 
smarter than people I ll agree  It s scientifically impossible 
Kurt Fawzi started talking about how long it would take to get to the Gamma System  you jumped right into it and began talking up a ship  Did you think that if you got them started on that it would take their minds off Merlin Merlin till they die  But I was serious about the ship  An idea hit me  You gave it to me; you and Klem Zareff Why  I didn t say a word    
selling arms and ammunition at a profit of two hundred sols a ton  and Klem was talking as though a bumper crop was worse than a Green Death epidemic  If we had a hypership  look what we could do  How much do you think a settler on Hoth or Malebolge or Irminsul would pay for a good rifle and a thousand rounds  How much would he pay for his life --that s what it would come to  And do you know what a fifteen-cc liqueur glass of Poictesme brandy sells for on Terra  One sol; Federation money  I ll admit it costs like Nifflheim to run a hypership  but look at the difference between what these tramp freighter captains pay at Storisende and what they get of our own  these planters would be breaking new ground instead of cutting their plantings  and maybe we d get some money on this planet that was worth something  You have a good idea there  son  But maybe there s an angle to it you haven t thought of lift a finger to build a hypership  They ve completely lost hope in everything but Merlin in orbit off Koshchei  I think I could do that you  make no mistake about that  But you and I will be the only two people on Poictesme who can be trusted with the truth  We ll have to lie to everybody else  with every word we speak  We ll have to lie to Flora  and we ll have to lie to your mother  Your mother most of all  She believes in absolutes  Lying is absolutely wrong  no matter whom it helps; telling the truth is absolutely right  no matter how much damage it does or how many hearts it breaks  You think this is going to be worth a price like that Don t you 
looking at it for the first time  And then tell me whether it ll be worth it or not Great Ghu!
me; I honestly never realized     Yes  Conn  This is a cause worth lying for Senta s  but let s take a few minutes and talk this over  How are you going to get it started it without me  I think I ve done that already  Then convince them that we ll have to have a ship to get to Koshchei  and--has have no idea what all there is  You remember the old Force Command Headquarters  the one the Planetary Government took over  I know where there s a duplicate of that  completely underground  It has everything the other one had  and a lot more  because it ll be cram-full of supplies to be used in case of a general blitz that would knock out everything on the planet  And a chain of hospitals  And a spaceport  over on Barathrum  that was built inside the crater of an extinct volcano  There won t be any hyperships there of course  but there ll be equipment and material  We might be able to build a ship there  And supply depots  all over the planet; none of them has ever been opened since the War  Don t worry about financing; we have that company organized  a regular limited-liability company  with a charter  We ll contribute the information you brought back from Terra  and we ll get the rest of this gang to put all the money we can twist out of them into it  so we ll be sure they won t say   Aw  Nifflheim with it!  and walk out on us as soon as the going gets a little tough pass the word to Kurt to get a meeting set up for tomorrow afternoon What ll we call this company  Merlin Rediscovery  Ltd 
know  this is just a war-material prospecting company  I ll impress on them that Merlin is to be kept a secret  That way  we ll have to engage in regular prospecting and salvage work as a front  I ll see to it that the front is also the main objective party 
IV

do you we ll go to the meeting in the afternoon Meeting 
What meeting 
Oh  we didn t have time to tell you 
Conn brought back a lot of information on locations of supply depots and things like that  An amazing list of things that haven t been discovered yet  It s going to be too much for us to handle alone; we re organizing a company to do it  We ll need a lot of labor  for one thing; jobs for some of these Tramptowners That s going to be something awfully big 
You never did anything like that before 
from now on Who s going to be in this company 
Dawes  All that crowd The Fawzis  Office Gang 
they ll want Conn to take them right to where Merlin is  the first thing Well  not the first thing 
couldn t find out anything about on Terra I ll bet you couldn t!
else  and make microcopies and all  but not one word about computers  Forty years  and they still have the security lid welded shut on that you believe in that thing to a thousand light-years  They couldn t do all that out of their heads  They d have to have computers  and the one they d use to correlate everything and work out grand-strategy plans would have to be a dilly  Why  I d give anything just to look at the operating panels for that thing No wonder you couldn t find out about it  You were looking for something that doesn t exist  just like all these old cranks that sit around drinking brandy and mooning about what Merlin s going to do for them  and never doing anything for themselves Oh  they re going to do something  now  Flora 
When we get this company organized--
stuff you ve been bringing in from Tenth Army  and then you ll go looping off chasing Merlin  like the rest of them  Well  maybe that ll be a little better than just sitting in Kurt Fawzi s office talking about it  but not much I have to go 
these children from growing up to be Merlin-worshipers like their parents again Conn 
gotten Flora started like that she doesn t believe in Merlin  that s her business  A lot of these people do  and I m going to help them hunt for it  That s why they all chipped in to send me to school on Terra; remember Yes  I know 
believe there is a     that thing Why  of course 
somewhere on Poictesme  or in the Alpha System Well  do you think it would be a good thing to find it 
It frightens me 
it  A soulless intelligence; it seems evil to me soulless  but you re not afraid to ride in one meant to make machines like that  wiser than they are Now wait a minute  Mother  You re talking to a computerman now 
sort  It doesn t think; the people who make computers and use them do the thinking  A computer s a tool  like a screwdriver; it has to have a man to use it Well  but    
aren t  meant  to do things; they  mean  to do things  and nine times out of ten  they end by doing them  It may take a hundred thousand years from a Stone Age savage in a cave to the captain of a hyperspace ship  but sooner or later they get there Wade Lucas wanted me to drop in on him for a checkup 
just wants to size up his future brother-in-law Well  you ought to go see him 
How did Flora come to meet him  anyhow 
for an opening to start a practice  and he heard about some medical equipment your father had found somewhere and came out to see if he could buy it  Your father and Judge Ledue and Mr  Fawzi talked him into opening his office here  Then he and Flora got acquainted    What did you think of him  Conn 
Seems like a regular guy  I think I ll like him 
this morning Ah  nice 
that here very often a suit made short jacket like this  or get him to buy himself a shoulder holster  He s ruined every coat he ever owned  carrying a gun on his hip Hello  Conn 
you got all your clothes on this morning  You were just plain indecent  yesterday     You know Fred Karski  don t you What s going on 
again his colors in the War  and he s in command of the regiment Regiment  You need a whole regiment 
platoon  but we have to call it a regiment so he can keep his old Rebel Army rank We could use a regiment  Conn 
have no idea how bad things have gotten  Over on the east coast  the outlaws are looting whole towns  About four months ago  they sacked Waterville; burned the whole town and killed close to a hundred people  That was Blackie Perales  gang with the  Harriet Barne  which means practically any outlaw No  Fred; there is a Blackie Perales 
be a planter  down in the south  The banks foreclosed on him when he couldn t pay his notes  and he turned outlaw  That s the way it s going  all around  Every time a planter loses his plantation or a farmer loses his farm  or a mechanic loses his job  he turns outlaw  Take Tramptown  here  We used to plant nothing but melons  Then  when the sale for wine and brandy dropped  the melon-planters began cutting their melon crops and raising produce  instead of buying it from up north  and turning land into pasture for cattle  The people we used to buy foodstuffs from couldn t sell all they raised  and that threw a lot of farmhands out of work  So they got the idea there was work here  and they came flocking in  and when they couldn t get jobs  they just stayed in Tramptown  stealing anything they could  We don t even try to police Tramptown any more; we just see to it they don t come up here come from since we organized the Home Guard  They tried to  a couple of times  at first  There may have been a few survivors; they spread it around that Gordon Valley wasn t any outlaws  health resort Why don t you join us  Conn 
belong I d like to  but I m afraid I m going to be kind of busy 
Yes  You will be  at that 
So I hear 
Conn Well  no 
but we will I see you ve started carrying one 
if I can protect myself  it ll save somebody else the job of protecting me trouble are armed  you have to be armed too  When did you last see an Air Patrol boat around here  or even a Constabulary trooper  All we have here is the Home Guard and Tom Brangwyn and three deputies  and his pay and theirs is always six months in arrears every year  currency that buys less every month  And do-it-yourself justice your father s talking about organizing afternoon  aren t you Yes  Just what are you going to do  after you get it organized 
equipment and stores that the Third Force left behind    father and me to handle alone  even if we didn t feel morally obligated to take in the people who contributed toward sending me to school on Terra  You ought to be interested in it  I know of six fully supplied hospitals  intended to take care of the casualties in case of a System States space-attack  You can imagine  better than I can  what would be in them here; you re not going to let these people waste time looking for this alleged computer  this thing they call Merlin  are you location of Merlin  but--I ll bet you don t!
equipment on this planet  In the long run  I d say  more valuable than everything else together  We certainly aren t going to ignore it educated at the University of Montevideo about Merlin being able to do some of the things these laymen like Kellton and Fawzi and Judge Ledue think it could  Those sorts of misconceptions and exaggerations have to be allowed for  But I have no doubt whatever that the master computer with which they did their strategic planning is probably the greatest mechanism of its sort ever built  and I have no doubt whatever that it still exists somewhere in the Alpha System You mean you categorically state that that computer actually exists 
Merlin exists 
V

Let s come to order; we must conduct this meeting regularly 
Gentlemen  please; let me have your attention 
Somebody will have to preside 
Would you take the chair  Judge Ledue 
Excellent suggestion  Conn  Judge  will you preside 
course  Judge  You re the logical chairman  Here  will you sit here introduction to any of you the informal meeting in Mr  Fawzi s office  yesterday  Conn  would you please repeat what you told us  Elaborate as you see fit Well  Conn; how about Merlin  That s what we re interested in 
and you want him to talk about that idiotic fantasy!the blasphemer! I don t know the exact location of Merlin 
certain that Merlin exists  if not on Poictesme then somewhere in the Alpha System  and I am equally certain that we can find it but you re still certain it exists Why are you certain it doesn t 
Why  the whole thing s absurdly fantastic!
to me were telling us about  I think Colonel Zareff  here  who served in the Alliance Army  will bear me out that such an attack was plainly impossible Intelligence lag 
expect  with General Headquarters thirty parsecs from the fighting Yes  A computer can only process the data that s been taped into it 
Poictesme as a low-order probability  but war is the province of chance; Clausewitz said that a thousand years ago  Foxx Travis wasn t the sort of commander to let himself get caught  even by a very low-order probability mention  in any history of the War  of Merlin  How do you get around that I don t have to  How do you get around it 
 Huh  
Third Force  even to the enemy  Say the stories were unfounded; say Merlin never existed  Yet the belief in Merlin was an important historical fact  and no history of the War gives it so much as a footnote one thing  Systematic suppression  backed by the whole force of the Terran Federation  A gigantic conspiracy of silence!Now I ve heard everything!
Not quite everything  Doctor 
one of these days  that we have found Merlin Yes  that ll be the day!
to argue with you  Conn Maxwell gave you a thousand-year-old quotation; I ll give you another  from Thomas Paine:  To argue with those who have renounced the use and authority of reason is as futile as to administer medicine to the dead   I ll add this  Conn Maxwell knows better than this balderdash he s been spouting to you  I don t know what his racket is  and I m not staying to find out  You will  though--to your regret Well  let s get to business 
argue about the existence of Merlin; we know that  Let s discuss the question of finding it I still think it s somewhere off-planet 
moons of Pantagruel    No  that s too far; they d keep it where they could use it 
The old GHQ 
like the place Rodney found under Tenth Army I hope not 
over Well  wherever it is  finding it is going to be expensive 
information my son brought back from Terra  Doctor Lucas was right about one thing; that s worth millions of sols  Well  I propose  also  that we set up a company and get it chartered; a prospecting company  to operate under the Abandoned Property Act of 867  My son and I will contribute this information as our share in the capitalization of the company  The work of opening these Federation installations can go on concurrently with the search for Merlin  and the profits can finance it Well  let s get organized 
company It is of the first importance 
objective--Merlin--as close a secret as possible  The Planetary Government would like to get hold of it--and I leave you to ask yourselves how far Jake Vyckhoven and his cronies are to be trusted with anything like that--and I have no doubt the Federation might try to take it away from us Couldn t do it  Rodney 
Federation abandoned in the Trisystem is public domain now  We have a Federation Supreme Court ruling--What s legality to the Federation 
fought a criminally illegal war of aggression against my people Banner Black and Green Well  I think it s a good idea to keep quiet about it  myself 
All right 
sound like anything but another salvage company  I suggest we call it Litchfield Exploration & Salvage Good name  Rodney 
That a motion  I second it 
We can t get all this cleared up now 
appointed    Well  that seems to be cleared up 
meeting day after tomorrow evening; the committees should have everything set up  and we should be able to organize ourselves and elect permanent officers  Is there anything else to discuss  or do I hear a motion to adjourn You heard me mention a spaceport 
that it s over on Barathrum  inside the crater of an extinct volcano  I think we ought to have a look at that  first of all I know you seemed to think yesterday that Merlin is off-planet 
on Poictesme We ought to nail that spaceport down first 
headquarters here to blitz Poictesme  or they wouldn t have built that  And this underground headquarters would be the safest place on the planet; they d make sure of that  Staff brass don t like to get caught out in the rain  not when it s raining hellburners and planetbusters  Merlin would be too big to take there along with them  so they d put it there in the first place I want to find Merlin as much as any of you 
was the only thing I was trained for  We ll look there first coast Great Ghu! We ll need an army to go in there!
and all Then we ll get an army together 
make a little of that reward money that s been offered Lots of labor surface; from the plans  I d say they just dug a big pit  built the headquarters in it  and filled it in  There are two entrances  a vertical shaft and a horizontal tunnel the rock at the outer ends at Tenth Army kind of a public-works program here in Litchfield  We can t start this till after the wine-pressing s over  and we ll need a lot of labor  as I pointed out  Now  it s important that we keep all our projects a secret until we can get our claims filed  If we start this municipal fix-up-and-clean-up program  we can give work to a lot of these drifters who haven t been able to get jobs on the plantations  get them organized into gangs  and keep them together till we re ready for the Force Command job around in Litchfield  we could pick out the best workers  get rid of the incompetents  and train a few supervisors  That s going to be one of our worst headaches; getting capable supervisors You telling me 
about: where we d get gang-bosses  And another thing; this municipal housecleaning would mask our real preparations Well  we need something like that 
a long time  I guess it took Conn  coming home from Terra  to see how badly we ve let the town get run down  Franz  suppose you and Tom Brangwyn and Lorenzo form a committee on that  Look around  see what needs fixing up worst  and set up a project  Who s city engineer now Abe O Leary; he died six years ago 
his successor Well  I guess I never got around to that 
positive  You know  you re only twenty-three  As long as you agree with those people  you re a brilliant young man; you start getting ideas of your own  and you re just a half-baked kid  You let the older and wiser heads run things  You can t begin to hope to foul things up the way they can  Look at all the experience they ve had But we ve got to have a ship  Everything depends on that 
the rest of them have this duplicate Force Command thing first  though  Keep them happy  As soon as we have that opened  you can take a gang and run over to Barathrum and grab your spaceport  Wait till they find out that Merlin isn t at Force Command Duplicate  Then you can convince them it s really on Koshchei

Nice 
Where did you dig it 
Where we re going  Tenth Army 
I ll bet she ll do Mach Three 
gauge is marked up to four  And she has everything: all kinds of detection instruments  cameras  audiovisual pickups  armament  And the armor; you can take her through any kind of radiation Still think it s worth the price  son 
Keep your eye on that  Father 
get rid of If we put this over 
steady work and good homes  We can have a park there  with fountains that ll work  Maybe even Flora and Mother will think we ve done something worth doing take it  I can there  Sunrise on the east side of Snagtooth; Tenth Army s just behind us  Now  let s see if this airspeed gauge is telling the truth or just bragging shelters there s another one down on that bench  a couple of hundred feet below the edge of the plateau  They blasted rock down over that  The main entrance is a vertical shaft under that pre-stressed concrete dome  That was chapel  auditorium  or something  They just covered it with sheet metal and poured a foot of concrete on top Hey  you re looking great  Conn!
somebody had to sit on the lid here  and Jerry Rivas and I cut cards for it and Jerry won You didn t tell me Anse was with you 
the birds; I d as soon count sheets of toilet paper as this stuff we re using for money  Sooner  Toilet paper can be used for something  and this paper money s too stiff  Maybe some of this stuff we re digging here isn t worth much  but at least it s real Had breakfast yet 
back of the kitchen  waiting for the cook to skin it and cut it up either and show him the sights  And don t worry about him bumping you out of a job  Worry about the six or eight extra jobs you ll have to do besides your own  from now on myself; 90-mm tank gun  When we want a wall out of the way  we get it out of the way don t have the central power on here; there s a big mass-energy converter  but we re tearing it down to ship out The CO here must have had squirrel blood 
the evacuation orders came through he just gathered up everything there was topside and crammed it down here  any old way  Honest to Ghu  this place was packed solid when we found it  Nobody d believe it Wait till you see the next one 
You mean there s another place like this 
hand grenade  too Litchfield and Tom Brangwyn s sending one of his deputies to help boss them  Well have to keep an eye on this crowd; they re all Tramptown hoodlums  but that s the best we can get  We re going to have to get this place cleaned out in a hurry  We only have about two weeks till the wine-pressing s over  and then we want to start the next operation  Conn  did you see all that engineering equipment  down on the bottom level bulldozers and manipulators and so on  We can move it direct to Force Command  How are we fixed for blasting explosives Name it and we have it  Cataclysmite  FJ-7  anything you want 
We ll need a lot of it 
freighter; first  to move this stuff out of here  and then to move the stuff out of Force Command  And we want it mounted with heavy armament  too  We not only want a freighter  we want a fighting ship You think so 
I m sure of it 
outlaws; there must be hundreds of them holing up over there  That s where all the trouble on the east coast comes from  Now  outlaws are sure-thing players  They want to be alive to spend their loot  and they won t tackle anything that s too tough for them  A lot of guards and combat equipment may look like a loss on the books  but the books won t show how much of a loss you might take if you didn t have them  I want this operation armed till it ll be too much for all the outlaws on the planet to tackle about the older and wiser heads  Let me handle them  I ve been around them  heaven pity me  longer than you have  Just give me an audiovisual of your proxy and I ll vote your stock How much stock do I have  by the way 
twenty centisols a share  But watch where it goes after we open Force Command it  That ll keep him out of mischief  Dolf Kellton s secretary; he has an office force at the Academy and can conscript students to help  He s organizing a research team from his seniors and post-grad students to work in the Planetary Library at Storisende  There are a lot of old Third Force records there; he may find something useful  Of course  Lester Dawes is treasurer What are you 
yesterday log-rolling  baby-kissing and cigar-passing to get And what am I  if it s a fair question 
stockholder  The only other one is Judge Ledue; as a member of the judiciary  he did not feel it proper to accept official position in a private corporation  Tom Brangwyn s Chief of Company Police; Klem Fawzi is Commander of the Company Guards  And we have a law firm in Storisende lined up to handle our charter application  Sterber  Flynn & Chen-Wong  Sterber s married to Jake Vyckhoven s sister  Flynn s son is married to the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury  and Chen-Wong is a nephew of the Chief Justice  All of them are directly descended from members of Genji Gartner s original crew You don t anticipate any trouble about getting the charter 
a contragravity ship  There are about a dozen in the hands of receivers for bankrupt shipping companies; he might find one that s still airworthy  Oh; you remember how I insisted on absolute secrecy about our Merlin objective  That s working out better than my fondest expectations  It s leaking like a machine-gunned water tank  and everybody it leaks to is positive that we know exactly where Merlin is or we wouldn t be trying to keep it a secret Conn  when Flora comes home  you won t argue with her  will you 
Only in self-defense 
No; I won t argue with her at all 
Oscar! You stop that!
No  Leo  I don t know when 
You just have space for it  and we ll fill it up  And don t ask me what sort of stuff  You know what a salvage operation s like; you just haul out the stuff as you come to it on the  Countess  this morning  and Ghu only knows how many in their own vehicles  and they all seem to think if there s work for some there ought to be work for all  and some of them are getting nasty are doing all right  once they found out we weren t taking any foolishness Well  Conn  we re in 
Exploration & Salvage  Ltd  And Lester Dawes has found us a contragravity ship How much will it cost us 
centisol  You know those old ships on Mothball Row  back of the old West End ship docks at Storisende Commercial Enterprise Encouragement Act  She s an Army combat freighter  regimental ammunition ship  Of course  she still has armament; we ll have to pay to get that off Why 
weight  We want her for a cargo ship  don t we That s what she was built for  What kind of armament 
missile launchers amidships  And a secondary gun battery of 70-mm s and 50-mm auto-cannon  I know the class; we captured a few of them  Good ships Patrol  Look  the Government won t like our having anything like that They re giving her to us  aren t they 
Gehenna with what the Government likes!
they d put a few of those ships into commission  they could wipe out these outlaws and a private company wouldn t need an armed ship May I use your screen  Kurt 
There s talk about tearing the armament out 
started on it  I think I ll go in to Storisende tomorrow and see the ship for myself  See what I can do about ammunition for those guns  too But  Rod 
to start a war taking that ship down into the Badlands  Remember Ever hear the name Blackie Perales 
You think we really need that  Rod 
need  and how hard up we re going to be for capable supervisors  This thing s a training program  Kurt  and we ll need every man we train on it city find Merlin  everything ll be all right Somebody s been talking!
services on the planet on my screen today; they all want the story about what s happening here  They ve heard we know where Merlin is; that Conn Maxwell found out on Terra They just put two and two together and threw seven 
 Herald-Guardian  ship-news reporter interviewed me when I got in  and found out I d been studying cybernetics and computer theory on Terra  What did you tell them didn t believe me  A bunch of them are coming out here tomorrow  What are we going to tell them  We ll all have to have the same story I 
town till they re gone Why don t you steer them onto Wade Lucas 
anything denied  he ll do it for you Conn  I know this Lucas is going to marry your sister 
but how much do you know about him 
meeting against him  I suppose if I d come from off-planet  I wouldn t believe in Merlin either Hah! But doesn t he believe in Merlin 
He makes noises like it 
You know what I think 
That s why they haven t come back to get it long ago Pretty big thing to mislay 
officers who d know where it was  Well  say they all went back to Terra on the same ship  and the ship was lost at space  Sabotage  one of our commerce raiders that hadn t heard the War was over  maybe just an ordinary accident  But the ship s lost  and the location of Merlin s lost with her That could happen 
watching  spying  This Lucas; he showed up here about a year after you went to Terra  And who does he get engaged to  Your sister  And what does he do here  Goes around arguing that there is no Merlin  getting people to argue with him  getting them mad  so they ll blurt out anything they know  I m an old field officer; I know all the prisoner-interrogation tricks in the book  and that s always been one of the best was cut himself off from learning anything more from any of us  In his place  would you have done that  No; you d have tried to take the lead in hunting for Merlin yourself  Now wouldn t you How long s he been like that  anyhow 
bossing tramp labor and taking care of his money and coming in out of the rain  Klem Zareff s as sane as I am  But on the subject of the Terran Federation  he s crazy as a bedbug  What is a bedbug  anyhow like Tramptown on Terra  too Uhuh  I suppose  in Klem s boots  I d be just as crazy as he is 
Kindelburg  on Ashmodai  and the next minute Kindelburg was a puddle of radioactive slag That was in  51  wasn t it  I read about it 
famous victory 
VII

That s it; you can still see where they put off the shots 
Tom 
the screens; I ll transmit to you  I m going in to see what s wrong No 
to study robotics for You getting it  Klem 
go Klem! What s wrong  We aren t getting you 
Take the jeep over to the tunnel entrance 
Move out into the tunnel a few feet; relay from me to Klem 
me; I m getting him  What s the matter with the radio in here  The snooper s all right  isn t it Sure  We just can t transmit out 
It ll transmit clear through Snagtooth It won t transmit through collapsium 
Bring the gang in; it s safe as far as we ve gotten 
We ll just have to string wires out 
Where do you suppose it is 
top  I suppose  Let s go up and work down; I can t wait till we ve found it Men and women  all officers or civilians 
even have enlisted men to cook for them  And we haven t found a scrap of paper with writing on it  or an inch of recorded sound-tape or audiovisual film  Remember those big wire baskets  down at the mass-energy converters  Before they left  they disintegrated every scrap of writing or recording  This is where Merlin is; they were the people who worked with it It s Merlin!
We ve found it!
Hold it!
Wait till I take a look at this thing 
for the records and data of every man and woman in the Third Force for the whole War  It s like the student-record machine at the University everything; that s personnel  Wouldn t have Merlin in here Well  we ll just keep on hunting for it till we do find it 
It s here somewhere  It has to be 

VIII

our ten-mile radius thing that even looks like law around here  I d say we have an obligation to give them protection  Have your boats investigate them; if they re legitimate  tell them they can call on us for help if they need it There s a lot of stuff around here  in small caches 
slacks off here  we could pick that stuff up sometimes  and a bull can make money sometimes  but in the long run  a hog always loses   Let the other people find some of this; it ll all help the Plan  Fact is  I ve been thinking of leaking some information  if I can do it without Fawzi and that gang finding out  Do you know a good supply depot or something like that  say over on Acaire  or on the west coast  Big enough to be important  and to start a second prospectors  rush away from us How about one of those hospitals 
us  A lot of medical stores would be a good bait for him  I m afraid he s going to make trouble if we don t do something about him there s a lot of that  down to the southwest that Can t some of you get things started again 
place is worse than it was before they started cleaning up Yes  I know 
you opened Force Command  Kurt Fawzi s not been back here since don t you just take over  Kurt Fawzi couldn t care less what you do; he s forgotten he is mayor of Litchfield  He s forgotten there is a Litchfield over    to eat  I suppose you talk to Wade Lucas  He s got brains  and he s honest--nobody but an honest man would have made himself as unpopular as Lucas has  If you pretend to be disillusioned with this Merlin business it might help convince him the last two weeks  Yes  He d help get things straightened out Well! I hope you like what you ve done!
For a start  yes 
For a start! You know what you ve done 
Yes  I don t know what you think I ve done  though  Tell me 
world Merlin-crazy  Look at the stock market    roulette with five chambers loaded out of six  Some of this so-called stock that s being peddled around isn t worth five millisols a share--Seekers for Merlin  Ltd   closed today at a hundred and seventy  You notice  there isn t any L  E  & S  being traded  If you don t believe me  talk to Lester Dawes; he ll tell you what we think of this market Well  it s your fault!
to play the market with  They wouldn t have money enough to play a five-centisol slot machine if we hadn t gotten a little business started Why  this whole country in here is simply swarming with outlaws  They fired on one of our gunboats  the  Werewolf   yesterday yesterday outlaw-fighting for us  and as long as the country s full of small independent parties  the outlaws go after them and leave us alone and a lot of the outlaws  too are Federation agents; they re waiting till we find Merlin  and then they ll all jump us Well 
admit that  as a possibility  If so  we ll need heavier weapons than we have  This spaceport on Barathrum might be just the place to get them we grab that place and move all the heavy guns and missiles here  we could stand off anybody these gunboats  Let me see   Goblin   Fred Karski  And  Vampire   Charley Gatworth  And  Dragon   Stefan Jorisson  They re all good men  Home Guard; trained them myself Aren t you coming  Colonel 
here; no telling what might happen  But you keep in constant screen-contact; if you get into any trouble  I ll come with everything I can put into the air 
IX

Can you see it  yet 
before long We re picking up radiation 
count  I hope the place isn t hot We re getting that  too 
radiation; something must be on there Something s operating there 
everybody! General alert  Prepare for combat; prepare to take immediate evasive action  We must assume that the spaceport is occupied  and that the occupants are hostile  Captain Poole  will you please make ready aboard your ship  Reduce both speed and altitude  and ready your guns and missiles at once Well  now  wait a minute  young fellow 
don t know--No  I don t  And I want all of us alive after we find out  too 
think so    That s occupied 
going  Now  Fred  don t start any shooting unless you have to  but don t get yourself blown to MC waiting on them to fire the first shot Missile coming up; counter-missile off!
Grab onto something  everybody!
Be quiet  all of you!
there  Back three or four miles; close enough so they won t dare use thermonuclears  Take cover behind one of those ridges  where they can t detect you  Then we can start figuring what the Gehenna to do next We did  sir;  Dragon  
rid of it  We took a hit  Gun turret s smashed  Milt Hennant s dead  and Abe Samuels probably will be before I m done talking  and if we get this crate down in one piece  it ll do for a miracle till a real one happens Well  be careful how you shoot those things off 
won t have any spaceport Fred  how are you and Charley fixed for counter-missiles 
carry  Charley  you go up on top of this ridge above  and take cover where you can watch the mountain  Transmit what you see back to the ship  Fred  you take a position about a quarter way around from where you are now  Don t let them send anything over  but don t start anything yourselves  I m coming out with everything I can gather up here; I ll be along myself in a couple of hours  and the rest will be stringing in after me  In the meantime  Rodney  you re in command Colonel 
of these new prospecting companies  We have no right to take it away from them  have we They fired on us without warning 
and it s ten to one Abe won t live either  We owe them something for that the spaceport long enough to get the detection system working and put the defense batteries on ready  They didn t do that since this morning  and up to last evening they neglected to file claim  I ll assume they re on the wrong side of the law  They re outlaws  Conn  All the raids along the east coast; everybody s blamed them on the Badlands gangs  I ll admit they re responsible for some of it  but I ll bet this gang at the spaceport is doing most of it Now what did you do 
you got the ship; all the pickups would be smashed before they could see what really happened  You re about ten miles south of that  Be with you in a few minutes Gunboats are only half an hour behind 
screens on to them  Anse; you know the combinations  Now let s see what kind of a mess we re in here  Poltergeist  
They re launching missiles faster than we can shoot them down 
That s usually the beginning of the end 
happen too often during the War  We ve got to get inside that place  It s a lot of harmless fun to send contragravity robots out to smash each other  but it doesn t win battles  Battles are won by men  standing with their feet on the ground  using personal weapons We ll have to win this one pretty soon 
amount of nuclear energy we ve been releasing will be detectable anywhere on the planet by now  The Government has a ship like the  Lester Dawes  in commission; if this keeps on  she ll be coming out for a look Then we ll have help 
We need Government help like we need the polka-dot fever 
themselves  and we ll have fought a battle for nothing Look at this 
You know  it s possible they don t know that thing exists 
twenty men; fewer than that couldn t accomplish anything I ll be putting mine on the table along with them 
lead them in You better pick the men to go with me  Colonel 
know them better than I do  We ll need working equipment  too; I have no idea what we may have to take out of the way  inside I won t call for volunteers 
they did their volunteering when they joined Let me pick one man  Colonel 
I ll pick me

Who the blazes are they 
could have gotten down there Prisoners 
shoved off  and left when the fighting started  Cover me I m going down and talk to them 
Who are you 
this gang here Litchfield Exploration & Salvage; I m Conn Maxwell 
What s going on topside 
nuclears  and they herded us down here  Have you cleaned the bloody murderers out We re working on it 
yours and passengers    They burned our home and killed our servants 
kidnapped my father and me    They ve been keeping us here as slaves 
It s the Blackie Perales gang 
of a contragravity ship into a spacecraft  I beg your pardon  Captain Nichols; she was a fine ship--for her intended purpose You re Captain Nichols 
Barne  on her  to convert her to an interplanetary craft  of all idiotic things My name s Yves Jacquemont 
retired hyperspace maintenance engineer; I had a little business at Waterville  buying  selling and rebuilding agricultural machinery  This gang found out about me; they raided and burned our village and carried me and my daughter  Sylvie  away  We ve been working for them for the last four months  tearing Captain Nichols  ship down and armoring her with collapsium How many pirates are there here 
You get us out of here 
a chance at them How about arms  You can t do much with clubs and fists 
house  where they store their loot  There s plenty of arms and ammunition  and anything else you can think of  They ve used us to help stow the stuff; we know where it is to the broad passage  Take four men in the jeep; have them lift two of them and bring them here  Then  you get out to the end of the tunnel and call the  Lester Dawes   Tell them what s happened  tell them they can get gunboats all the way in  and wait to guide them when they arrive Why does this Perales want an interplanetary ship 
He s crazy!
organizing all the pirates and outlaws on the planet into one band and making himself king  He s heard that there are Space Navy superweapons on Koshchei--I suppose there are  at that--and he wants to get a lot of planetbusters and hellburners and annihilators blow the  Harriet Barne  up as soon as he got her out of atmosphere Up to the top 
right at the next intersection Let s look these robots over 
can load with blasting explosive and send ahead of us on contragravity Well  look what you re doing to him!
dirty trick to play on a little robot!treats robots like people they are--but they do what you tell them  and they learn tricks  and they have personalities ever since I was in pigtails Hi  Conn! You all right 
Conn s on-screen!
Well  we re in  all right 
too Did you hear from Anse 
Yes  he just screened in 
can get in That s right; clear into the crater 
Well  we re going to put three of them inside 
flamethrowers  portable machine guns  bomb-launchers; regular special-weapons section  What can you do where you are crater  and then find a vertical shaft and go up topside and make as much disturbance as we can That s it!
get in  we ll go straight to the top  Look for us in about an hour; it s going to take time getting to the tunnel-mouth without being spotted from above Why did the pirates bother with them 
chores for them the men didn t work  Perales threatened to punish the women and children  I wasn t doing any housework; I m too good a mechanic  I was helping on the ship them into battle them anywhere and risk having them recaptured cut our striking force down anyhow You re the officer in command  Conn 
decision  How soon can you attack  We re almost through to the crater top  We ll send up a couple of bomb-robots to clear things at the shaft-head and follow with everything we have Noncombatants and all 
Only thing we can do 
 If you want to make an omelet  you have to break eggs  
you want to make sauerkraut  you have to chop cabbage We d better send Gumshoe Gus up  first 
We ll need him later him 
it 
window-washers; you handle the snooper All right; follow me 
one for Milt Hennant!Well  nice seeing you 
How did you get in 
Over the top 
side  We have a quarter of the top gallery  and half of this one  Your father s cleaning up above  Klem s got some men working along the outside Hey  look! Look at that!
Who s she belong to 
She s ours 
the egg breakage 
XI

Well  our pay goes on from the day we were captured 
they re sending a party out to go over her What s this about the ship 
Storisende of her twenty-five men    She still belongs to Transcontinent & Overseas 
law nothing Well  of course  I m prejudiced 
getting us out of the hands of that bloodthirsty maniac and his cutthroats was nothing Wiping out the Perales gang wasn t nothing  Conn 
years I know  I m sorry 
and now we have no ship at all A ship means something to you 
Yes 
hypership of our own  and get our brandy and things to markets where we could get a decent price for them for a couple of years before I decided to retire and settle here or Baldur is over a thousand percent Well  don t give up too soon 
 Harriet Barne   of course  but you re entitled to prize-money on her  and that ought to buy you something you could build a spaceship out of That s right 
can be made here  Look  these pirates burned me out; except for the money I have in the bank  I lost everything  home  business and all  As soon as I can find a place for Sylvie to stay  I ll come back and go to work for your company building a spaceship  And a lot of the men who were working here are farm-tramps and drifters  one job s as good as another as long as they get paid for it  And I know a few good men in Storisende--engineers--who d be glad for a job  too stayed with us Of course it would; they d be glad to have her 
suppose you and I go into Storisende  and    Great Ghu!
ship!That s the  Harriet Barne  
ragged now  but--You helped these pirates do this to her 
help them  My throat s more valuable to me than the ship is to you; I can t get anybody to build me a new one Well  understand 
her into an interplanetary ship  It wouldn t cost much to finish the job We need an interplanetary ship like we need a hole in the head!
you think you re entitled to for this wreck court  if we can settle it any other way You mean you d litigate about this 
Litchfield Exploration & Salvage  But if you do want her  you ll have to pay for her We ll give you twenty thousand sols 
to be tightfisted  After all  you fought a gang of pirates and lost some men and a couple of boats; we have some moral obligation to you  But you ll have to realize that this ship  in her present state  is practically valueless even more I worked on them 
Conn  this thing about Merlin 
it  Ever since Dad and I came to Poictesme  I ve been hearing about it  but it s just a story  isn t it things when we find it looking for it realize that they had Merlin all along and didn t know it Why  look! They got them fixed! They re running!
I get you  chum 
Of course there s a Merlin 
Call him  right away; Ritz-Gartner Hotel  in Storisende  It s something about a ship Hi  Conn; we have one 
What kind of a ship 
You know her  The  Harriet Barne  
How the dickens did you wangle that 
O  s been losing money on her for years  He said if they had to pay prize-money on her and then either restore her to original condition or finish the job and build a spaceship they didn t want  it would almost bankrupt the company  They got up as high as fifty thousand sols for prize-money and we just laughed at them  So we made a proposition of our own    Conn shook his head  His father continued:  mimicked          
XII

Well  are we going to make the whole trip in free fall 
deceleration the other half fall about ten or fifteen hours  What we re going to have to do will be to lift off from Poictesme in the horizontal position the ship was designed for  and then make a ninety-degree turn after we re off-planet  with our lift and our drive working together  just like one of the old rocket ships before the Abbott Drive was developed Can you spare us Jerry Rivas for a while 
operations  As an influential non-office-holding stockholder  I d think so  He s only running around helping out here and there telling us about  Wade and I are forming a new company  Mainland Medical Materials  Ltd  Going to act as broker for L  E  & S  in getting rid of medical stores  Nobody in the company knows where to sell that stuff or what we ought to get for it I really didn t understand how much good this would do 
wouldn t have spoken so forcefully against it if I had  I thought it was nothing but this Merlin thing--Aaagh! Don t talk to me about Merlin!
talk to Kurt Fawzi and that crowd about Merlin till I m sick of the whole subject I see Len made you a suit out of that material 
hip-holster in Storisende  Won t even be necessary in Litchfield before long  Our new marshal had a regular reign of terror in Tramptown for a few days  and you wouldn t know the place  Wade  here  is acting mayor now so many companies you won t be able to to keep track of them before long Investments  Ltd ; you re a non-office-holding stockholder in that  too There s all sorts of stuff 
in short supply anywhere and that we could get good prices for off-planet  Get Federation sols for it  too The  City of Asgard  will be along in six months 
can have a real cargo assembled by then  You can make arrangements in advance to dispose of it on Terra or Baldur or Marduk ships now freighters off Mothball Row  and they re tearing them down and cannibalizing them into one spaceship  That work s being done here at Storisende Spaceport  And another company has gotten title to a couple of old office buildings and has a gang at work dismantling them for the structural steel  I think they re going to build a real spaceship real spaceships  there are going to be some rare-looking objects traveling around the Alpha System  I wonder what the next one s going to look like--a flying sky-scraper What I wonder 
interplanetary ships got to  There must have been hundreds of them running back and forth from here to Janicot and Koshchei and Jurgen and Horvendile during the War  They must have gone somewhere engines and used in the evacuation hundred to seven-fifty feet in diameter  One of those things couldn t carry more than a couple of hundred people  after you put in all the supplies and the hydroponic tanks and carniculture vats and so on for a four- to six-month voyage  I can t see the economy of altering anything that small for interstellar work  Why  the smallest of these tramp freighters that come in here will run about fifteen hundred feet I don t know what s the matter with those two 
thing they can agree on is that you and your father ought to stop whatever you re doing  right away  Your mother can t adjust to your father being a big Storisende businessman  and she says he ll lose every centisol he has and both of you will probably go to jail  and then she s afraid you will find Merlin  and Flora s sure you and your father are swindling everybody on the planet Sylvie  I had no idea things would be like that 
I wish I hadn t suggested that you stay there  now 
when Flora isn t there  and Flora and I get along when your mother isn t around  Mealtimes aren t much fun  though I m glad you re ready to get off 
freighter  the  Andromeda   Some private group in Storisende has chartered her  She s loading supplies now  I have a private detective agency  Barton-Massarra  trying to find out where s she s going  I think you d better get this ship off  right away We have everything aboard  all the supplies and everything 
We can lift off tonight

Spacemen s Hymn 
It s been a long time since I heard that played in earnest 
Well  we re off to see the Wizard 
Stand by for shift to vertical 
Ready for shift  Captain Nichols 
here  Captain Shifting over 
Your ship now  Captain Jacquemont 
Thank you  Mr  Nichols 
Course set  Captain 
My private detectives found out about the  Andromeda  
computermen with them  one they hired from the Stock Exchange  and one they practically shanghaied away from the Government  And some of the people who chartered the ship are members of a family that were interested in a positronic-equipment plant on Panurge at the time of the War They re just hunting for Merlin were looking for Merlin  Conn out of  If I had Merlin in my hip pocket right now  I d trade it for one good ship like the  City of Asgard  or the  City of Nefertiti   and give a keg of brandy and a box of cigars to boot  If we had a ship of our own  we d be selling lots of both  and not for Storisende Spaceport prices  either But don t you think Merlin s important 
better one than Jake Vyckhoven Well  we can bunk inside here tonight 
so crowded here fans going That looks like enough oxygen 
Yes  it makes its own ventilation; convection 
you go to sleep in here  and you ll smother in a big puddle of your own exhaled CO 2  Just watch what the smoke from that cigarette s doing We ll have to find the power plant  then 
guess how deep this place goes We ll find plans of the building 
I ve ever been on  you could always find plans  The troubleshooters always had them; security officer  and maintenance engineer You know what happened 
854  they left the power on  Now the conversion mass is all gone  and the plutonium s all spent  We ll have to find more plutonium  and tear this whole thing down and refuel it  and repack the mass-conversion chambers--provided nothing s eaten holes in itself after the mass inside was all converted How long will it take 
inside  and if there s been no structural damage  and if we keep at it--a couple of days like these anywhere else  and if we do  things ll probably be as bad there  We came here to fix things up and start them  didn t we

everything Port Carpenter; we re in the main administration building 
Have you an extra viewscreen  fitted for recording 
Yes  right here 
I have it on 
receive ship and a scout-boat in any claims yet  I wasn t sure whether I should make them for Alpha-Interplanetary  or Litchfield Exploration & Salvage Don t bother sending in anything to the Claims Office 
Sterber  Flynn & Chen-Wong file them  They ll be made for a new company we re organizing What  Another one 
we ve made application already  We can t claim exclusive rights to the whole planet  like the old interstellar exploration companies did before the War  but since you re the only people on the planet  we can come pretty close to it by detail beats everything I ever dug  Force Command and Barathrum Spaceport included  How big would you say it is  More than ten miles in radius About five or six  Ten or twelve miles across 
and the usual ten-mile radius  the same as at Force Command  We ll claim the place as soon as the company s chartered; in the meantime  send in everything else you can get views of find or don t find inside  As soon as the skeleton s up they put the armor on  and then build the rest of the ship out from the middle  It might be slower getting material in through the airlock openings  but it holds things together while they re working Why  this isn t a ship!
outside of a ship  They haven t done a thing inside Oh  yes  they have 
in--Abbott lift-and-drive  Dillingham hyperdrives  pseudograv  power reactors  converters  everything  They wouldn t have put on the shielding if they hadn t  They did that as soon as they had the outside armor on Wonder why they didn t finish her  if they got that far 
They didn t need her  They d had it; they wanted to go home 
Well  we re not going to finish her  not with any fifteen men 
can only handle so much robo-equipment at a time I never expected we d build a ship ourselves 
look the place over and get a few claims staked  When we ve done that  we ll go back and get a real gang together I don t know where you ll find them 
need a couple of hundred  and they ought all to be graduate engineers  We can t do this job with farm-tramps You made some good shipyard men out of farm-tramps on Barathrum 
And what ll you do for supervisors 
of others  You just keep a day ahead of your men in learning the job  you ll do all right You know  Yves  he ll do it 
he won t believe us  You can t stop a guy like that  All right  Conn; deal me in I won t let anybody be any crazier than I am 
decks and bulkheads  an air-and-water system  hydroponic tanks and carniculture vats  astrogation and robo-pilot equipment  about which I know very little  a hyperspace pilot system  about which I know nothing at all     Conn  why don t you just build a new Merlin  It would be simpler Merlin  This is what I want  right here finish her  but not with the gang that s here  We ll need a couple of hundred men  Now  with the supplies we ve found  we can stay here indefinitely  Should we do more exploring and claim some more of these places  or should we come home right away and start recruiting  and then come back with a large party  start work on the ship  and explore and make further claims as we have time find out what s going to be needed to finish the ship and what facilities you have to produce it  and get things cleaned up a little so that you can start work as soon as you have people to do it  I m organizing another company--don t laugh  now; I ve only started promotioneering--which I think we will call Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines  Get me all the views you can of the ship herself and of the steel mills and that sort of thing that will produce material for finishing her; I want to use them in promotion  By the way  has she a name Only a shipyard construction number 
ship  the one that discovered the Trisystem  Ouroboros II ; that s fine  Will do 
charter right away  We ll have to make Alpha-Interplanetary one of the stockholding companies  and also Koschchei Exploitation & Development  and  of course  Litchfield Exploration & Salvage    I ll go back and have a look at the power plant 
it s like the rest of this place  it ll be ready to go as soon as the reactors are started  I wish everybody here had left things like this when the main power was cut till we give you the go-ahead That ll be the control tower for all the machinery in here 
Anse  suppose you and I go take a look at it 
We ll take a look at the machines 
work back on the right and then come down on the other side  You know anything about this stuff Me  Nifflheim  no 
one  and I know whether it s set to receive or not There s one big power plant back here 
the middle  It only powers what s in front of it  There must be another one in either wing  for the isotope plant and the cartridge-case plant  I ll go look at them  But the power s been cut off from the machines in the main building  There s four big switches  one for each production line--Conn! What did you turn on  Turn it off  right away!
It s off 
The dickens it is!
supervisor-robots circling around  and a flock of workers    here  anyhow It didn t do any good  Pull another one 
that s what! The robots have turned on us!it any worse We can t do anything here 
shop-cleaning robots  They were the last things used here when the place closed down  and the two supervisors were probably controlled from a vehicle  and it s anybody s guess where that is now  When you threw that switch  it sent out an impulse that activated them  They re running their instruction-tapes  and putting the others through all their tricks know! I killed one of the buggers!Turn everything off and let s go  See what we can do outside 
Ham  where are you  Are you still alive 
I m back at the power plant 
big thing circling around here; every time I stick my head out  he makes a dive at me  I didn t know robots would attack people gather up that aisle is supposed to look like  When you get out in it  he knows you don t belong there and tries to grab you converter  Say I chuck one out to him; what would he do Grab it and take it away  like he s taped to do 
Okay; wait a minute 
You want to be careful back there 
reactor-repair robots are there; don t get  them  on the warpath next Let s have a look at them  What kind 
center We ll have to go back to Poictesme pretty soon 
want to go back empty  Well  I know that no matter what we dug up  and what we could sell or couldn t sell  there s always a market for power-unit cartridges  Electric-light units  household-appliance units  aircar and airboat units  any size at all  We run that plant at full capacity for a few days and we can load the  Harriett Barne  full  and I ll bet the whole cargo will be sold in a week after we get in

Planetary Hymn
everything you saw  and all the places you were  and everything you were doing    Gartner s Body My mother; she didn t get here  Is anything wrong 
you went away  Your mother s still moaning about all these companies your father s promoting--he never used to do anything like that  and it s all too big  and it s going to end in a big smash  And then she gets onto Merlin  You know  she won t say Merlin  she always calls it   that thing  I ve noticed that 
when it s found  and that sets Flora off  Flora says Merlin s a big fake  and you and your father are using it to rob thousands of widows and orphans of their life savings  and that sets your mother off again  Self-sustaining cyclic reaction  like the Bethe solar-phoenix  And every time I try to pour a little oil on the troubled waters  I find I ve gotten it on the fire instead  And then  Flora had this fight with Wade Lucas  and of course  she blames you for that Good heavens  why 
the fight  Lucas is in business with your father now  and she can t convince him that you and your father are a pair of quadruple-dyed villains  I suppose  Anyhow  the engagement is  phttt ! Conn  is my father going back to Koshchei As soon as we can round up some people to help us on the ship 
Then I m going along  I ve had it  Conn  I m a combat-fatigue case 
But  Sylvie; that isn t any place for a girl 
on Barathrum; remember Well  you d be the only girl  and    
together  at least a third of them will be girls  A lot of technicians are girls  and when work gets slack  they re always the first ones to get shoved out of jobs  I ll bet there are a thousand girl technicians out of work here--any line of work you want to name  I know what I ll do; I ll make a telecast appearance  I still have some news value  from the Barathrum business  Want to bet that I won t be the working girl s Joan of Arc by this time next week Yes  I know all about it 
a couple of weeks ago  Flora simply will not speak to me  and your mother begged me  in tears  to quit everything we re doing here  I tried to give her some idea of what would happen if I dropped this  even supposing I could; she wouldn t listen to me it s costing us million people  at least  Why  even these two makeshift ships they re putting together here at Storisende are giving work  one way or another  to almost a thousand  Think what things will be like a year from now  if this keeps on altruist for a son Pardner  when you call me that  smile 
I am smiling  With some slight difficulty 
Koshchei looking for a hypership  We have one  too  Calling her  Ouroboros II   Twenty-five-hundred-footer  We expect to have her to space in a few months  I surely don t need to tell you what that will do toward restoring planetary prosperity No  of course not; a hypership of our own  But    
Fawzi was saying    it  that s where it ll be found  I m interested in getting business started again  If Merlin is found  it would help  of course Don t look at me 
father and son--want some spaceships  They hired me to help build them  That s all I have in it people have been saying that if Merlin s found  it should be used to determine Government policy  A few extremists are beginning to say that Merlin ought to  be  the Government  and Jake Vyckhoven and his cronies ought to be dumped  Into the handiest mass-energy converter  preferably  You know  if anybody found Merlin and started it auditing the Planetary Treasury  Jake Vyckhoven d be the one who d be wanting a hypership Conn  I wish you d come along with me 
in Kurt s suite; we d all like to talk to you I m glad you could come  Conn 
could have gotten here  I asked him to come  but he had a prior engagement  A meeting with some of the financial people here  about some company he s interested in That s right; Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines 
Interstellar!
enough to go out to Koshchei; he wants to go clear out of the Trisystem  That s what we wanted to talk about; all this nonsense you and your father are in  Merlin s right here on Poictesme  It s right at Force Command  and if your father hadn t robbed us of all our best men  like Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes  we d have found it by now  I don t think you and your father care a hoot if we ever find Merlin or not!Kurt  that s a dreadful thing to say 
It s a dreadful thing to have to say 
me what Conn Maxwell or Rodney Maxwell are doing to help find it Who showed you where Force Command was 
Merlin Why do we    
If you don t know    
I know why I do  I want to see if you do  Do you 
Merlin would answer so many questions 
Questions I can t answer for myself 
jurisprudence that would give everybody absolute justice We have a man who joined us after you went off to Koshchei  Conn 
clergyman  from over Morven way  He says that Merlin could formulate an entirely new religion  which would regenerate humanity Well  I don t have any such lofty ideas 
Merlin to show us how to get some prosperity here; bring things back to what they were before Poictesme went broke woods with a book on how to chop down a tree  and no ax markets  If we find Merlin  and tape it with everything that s happened in the forty years since it was shut down  Merlin will tell us where to find new markets  But the markets won t come to us  We ll have to do our own exporting  and we ll need ships  Now  you men have been studying about Merlin  and hunting for Merlin  all your lives  I can t add anything to what you know  and neither can my father  You find Merlin  and we ll have the ships ready when you do find it Kurt  I think he has a point 
You re blasted well right he has 
for Conn Maxwell  you know where we d be  Back in Litchfield  sitting around in Kurt s office  talking about how wonderful things ll be when we find Merlin  and doing nothing to find it Kurt  I believe Conn is entitled to an apology 
that we have any hope of finding it at all Conn  I m sorry 
things I did  But we re all on edge; we ve been having so much trouble     Conn  it s right there at Force Command; I know it is  We ve been all over the place  We have shafts sunk at each of the corners; we ve used scanners  and put off echo shots  Nothing  We looked for additional passages out of the headquarters; there aren t any  But it has to be somewhere around  It just  has  to be!you ve overlooked  And if I can t  I ll try to scrape up some stuff on Koshchei for you  Deep-vein scanners  that sort of thing  from the mines Might be something Mr  Leibert thought of 
Then why in blazes didn t he screen us about it 
Who is this Leibert 
morning  I think He joined us after you left  Conn 
clergyman from Morven  No regular denomination; he has a sect of his own Yah  he would!
Pious fraud!
use Merlin to show us the true nature of God  and how to live in accordance with the Divine Will  He says Merlin can teach us a new religion Welcome  Brothers 
who is this with you we are about to find the Great Computer  Every sapient being in the Galaxy will honor your name for a thousand years help a few of these people to make a decent living I ll be satisfied young man spiritual values  The Great Computer must not be degraded to such uses; we should let it show us how to lift ourselves to a high spiritual plane    I tell you  the Great Computer is there  in the heart of the butte 
is completely buried  After it was made  no human touched it  The men who were here and used it in the War communicated with it only by radio in a dream!away with lying about is what you dream You think he s lying  I think he s just crazy 
here; he s trying to keep us from it  That s why he shifted all that equipment over on the butte  He s working for Sam Murchison I thought your theory was that the Federation had lost Merlin 
at Force Command  somewhere  They don t want it found  and they re going to do everything they can to stop us  I oughtn t to have left this fellow Leibert here alone; well  I won t do that again  Get Tom Brangwyn to help me 
XVI

Our hypership 
two on the agenda  The first thing we need is a ship for the Poictesme-Koshchei run  By this time next year  we ought to have a thousand to fifteen hundred people here at the least  We can t haul them all on that flying sardine can We ll need supplies  too  What was left here won t last forever 
And you re going to have to run this at a profit 
you ll have to keep the stockholders happy  People like Jethro Sastraman and some of these Storisende bankers aren t going to be satisfied with promises and long-term prospects; they ll want dividends too  Those ships that are building at Storisende will be finished before long claimed  the first thing you know  we ll own Port Carpenter and nothing else small ship Just zigzag around the planet and transmit in locations and views of whatever you find  and we ll send it on to Storisende from anything here you halfway around the world to bring back the only specialist in something yesterday at the latest Are you going to come along  Conn 
Oh  Lord  no! I m going to be doing fifteen things at once here 
Are they completely crazy 
they know the Government will snatch it as soon as they find it That is precisely Jake Vyckhoven s idea 
you he was afraid of Merlin  He s getting more afraid of it every day Hail Merlin!
But what 
are the sane people doing 
You ought to know 
of them on Koshchei now When are you going to get the ship finished 
Fawzi s pestering the daylights out of me  He wants that equipment you promised him revelation Command  And speaking about Leibert  Klem Zareff s been after me about him  You know I ve contracted for the full-time and exclusive services of this Barton-Massarra detective agency  Well  Klem wants me to put them to work investigating Leibert full-time services of the biggest private detective agency on Poictesme bribe and intimidate some of my office help  I have found microphones and screen-pickups planted around  I caught one of our clerks trying to make copies of voice-tapes  I think it s some of these other Merlin-chasing companies  trying to find out how close we are to it  Klem Zareff is recruiting more guards  But how soon are you going to get that ship built We re working on it  That s all I know  now 
off work on that ship we re building now  We won t need it Have they found a ship 
Where 
ships in the Alpha System except the  Harriet Barne  and the two they re building at Storisende  The place is marked on the map as Sickle Mountain Naval Observatory  It s just a bitty little dot  but the map was made before the evacuation started  It s where most of the troops in the system were embarked on hyperships  I think  Wait till I show you the views Great Ghu  are those all ships 
That s right  Look at this one  now 
Now we know where they all went 
Have you screened my father yet 
building those ships at Storisende  I m afraid Their tough luck 
issuing stock  and there s been a lot of speculation in it  This market s so inflated now that a puncture at one place might blow the whole thing out Tell him I ll screen him from Sickle Mountain All right  class dismissed 
your bags packed  We re going to work for real  now Don t worry about a market smash 
taken care of  Trisystem Investments has just bought up a lot of stock in both of those companies  and we ve set up agreements with them--informally  of course; we ll have to get them voted on by our own companies--to sell them ships from Koshchei  In return  the company that s building the ship out of four air-freighters will go to Janicot  and the company that s building a ship out of the old Leitzenring Building will go to Jurgen  and they ll both stay off Koshchei  Sterber  Flynn & Chen-Wong will probably be defending antitrust suits till the end of time  The Planetary Government has stopped liking us  you know about this time next year  won t there it  How soon can you get your ships in trip Well  don t forget that equipment you promised Kurt Fawzi 
We ll have that on  Jerry Rivas is gathering it up now 
How are you fixed for arms on Koshchei 
Marines on duty here  and they left everything they couldn t carry in their hands  Why  The Armageddonists and the Cybernarchists and Human Supremacy bought all you had on hand your crews might need something to argue their way off the ships at Storisende with  Things are getting just slightly rugged here  now

Ship-guard 
off; they ll take care of things  Get your people in that troop carrier over there  Everybody will stay at Interplanetary Building  None of the hotels are safe  not even the Ritz-Gartner  And be sure everybody s well armed when they come off the ship Venus and Skorvann on Loki  Any law we want  we make for ourselves Somebody here wants to talk to you No  they re not having anything to do-- Duck; quick! 
town  Why  no; your mother and Flora aren t speaking to either of us  any more  Pity  of course  but I m glad they re in Litchfield  It s a little healthier there There  you see!
I ve been telling you  We ll have to stop this the Mall  the day you came home  I had to was admit him to the lodge and give him the oath alive stopped jumping to conclusions and did a little thinking  You know  ever since I came here I ve been preaching to these people to stop looking for Merlin and do something to help themselves  You re smarter than I am  Conn; instead of opposing them  you re guiding them Did you tell Flora 
but she wouldn t listen  She just told me I d gotten to be as big a crook as you two time  Some of these days your luck s going to run out How can we stop 
us  and then go on hunting for Merlin ended  I was only ten then  but I can remember that very plainly  We can t stop it  and we wouldn t dare stop it if we could What s been going on here in the last month 
too busy to keep in touch  I know there s been rioting  and these crackpot sects  but    happening  There were four attempts to burglarize our offices  I told you about some of the other stuff  the microphones we found  and so on  The worst thing was Lucy Nocero  my secretary  She just vanished  a couple of weeks ago  Three days later  the police found her wandering in a park  a complete imbecile  Somebody who either didn t know how to use one or didn t care what happened had used a mind-probe on her  It s twenty to one she ll never recover It s this Storisende financial crowd 
things all their own way till Alpha-Interplanetary was organized  Now they re getting shoved into the background  and they don t like it They re making more money than they ever did  and they just love it 
Murchison Murchison!
Minister-General; all the authority of the Terran Federation  and nothing to enforce it with  He doesn t have a position  here; he has a disease  Sleeping sickness He certainly doesn t believe there is a Merlin  does he 
opposite number  He thinks this whole thing s a plot against the Federation  It s a good thing Klem didn t get around to repainting his combat vehicles black and green  the way he did the Home Guard stuff at Litchfield I d be more likely to think it was Vyckhoven 
ashamed to say that this heil-Merlin Cybernarchist gang are friendly to us  Or it could be some of the banking crowd  or some of these rival space-companies  Barton-Massarra is trying to find out  Well  we have some of Wade s pet suspects at Interplanetary Building now  There s been a meeting going for the last week to partition the Alpha Gartner System No statement  gentlemen!
released to all of you The scanning and mining equipment aboard the  Helen O Loy  
Command and unload it there fake preacher Well  they ve been busy 
one thing  You heard about the robo-bomb somebody launched at us the day we brought the ships in  didn t you Yes  and we heard about the Nocero girl  too 
hasn t it ever occurred to you or your dad that this fellow that calls himself Leibert might be mixed up with the gang that did that You suspect him  too 
know it; I sent them to some different law-enforcement people over in Morven  where he says he comes from  They never saw him before  and couldn t find anybody who did Well  He just doesn t have a police record  then 
themselves to preach; they get up in pulpits  in front of a lot of people  Those towns over in Morven are small enough for everybody to have known something about him  He s a fake  I tell you found out about him  I m beginning to wonder about him myself  I m sure I ve seen him  somewhere    We have things fixed up 
building the ship out of four air-freighters are chartered as Janicot Industries  Ltd ; they re going to specialize in chemical products  The other company has a charter now  too  They re going to operate on Jurgen and Horvendile  We ll sell them ships  and Alpha-Interplanetary will put on scheduled trips to all three planets and also Koshchei  We re getting along very nicely with them  except that everybody s competing for technicians and skilled labor  We have two hundred more people signed up for Koshchei  What you want to do is train as many of them as you can for ship-operation  Alpha-Interplanetary is going to start a training program here at Storisende; you d better leave one of your ships for them to work on  and send back as many ships as you can find officers and crews for We re getting things really started 
Yes  The only trouble is    
these people  Conn  Everybody ought to be making millions out of this by this time next year  but all any of them  even these Storisende bankers  can talk about is how soon we re going to find Merlin was on Poictesme; Merlin was a space-station a few thousand miles off-planet; there was a crew of operators aboard  and they communicated with Force Command by radio  When the War ended  they took it outside the system and shot off a planetbuster inside her  No more Merlin  How would that be I doubt  they d just quit  The market would collapse  everybody would be broke  it would just be the end of the War all over again  Conn  we can t let it stop now  We re going too fast to stop; if we tried it  we d smash up and break our necks

Conn  can you come back here to Poictesme for a while 
screen--too many people know our scrambler combinations  But I wish you were here Ship leaving Sickle Mountain tomorrow morning 
aboard Conn  I m scared 
really is a Merlin  after all vaccinated I m beginning to think so  too 
all You know what that gang who took the  Andromeda  to Panurge found 
Merlin  weren t they crew  This place had been turning out material for a computer of absolutely unconventional design; the two computermen they had with them couldn t make head or tail of half of it  And every blueprint  every diagram  every scrap of writing or recording  had been destroyed  But they found one thing  a big empty fiber folder that had fallen under something and been overlooked  It was marked: TOP SECRET  PROJECT MERLIN Project Merlin could have been anything 
references to Project Merlin  too  For instance  there was a routine division court-martial  a couple of second lieutenants  on a very trivial charge  Force Command ordered the court-martial stopped  and the two officers simply dropped out of the Third Force records  it was stated that they were engaged in work connected with Project Merlin  That s an example; there were half a dozen things like that Tell him what Kurt Fawzi and his crew found 
almost to the top of the underground headquarters  They found something on top of the headquarters; a disc-shaped mass  fifty feet thick and a hundred across  armored in collapsium  It s directly over what used to be Foxx Travis s office Merlin down to the collapsium on top of this thing; I rode down the shaft in a jeep and looked at it  Look  Conn  we don t know what this Project Merlin was; all this lore about Merlin that s grown up since the War is pure supposition Project military secret any longer  Why would he lie to me a Merlin  You lied because telling the truth would hurt them  Maybe Travis had the same reason for lying to you  Maybe Merlin s too dangerous for anybody to be allowed to find Frankenstein s Monster like Foxx Travis would lie if he didn t have some overriding moral obligation to And we know who s been making most of the trouble for us  too 
Yes 
Klem Zareff to kick my pants-seat  Sam Murchison  the Terran Federation Minister-General How d you get that 
Murchison s office  And some of our banking friends got the rest  This Human Supremacy League is being financed by somebody  Every so often  their treasurer makes a big deposit at one of the banks here  all Federation currency  big denomination notes  When I asked them to  they started keeping a record of the serial numbers and checking withdrawals  The money was paid out  at the First Planetary Bank  to Mr  Samuel S  Murchison  in person  The Armegeddonists are getting money  too  but they re too foxy to put theirs through the banks  I believe they re the ones who mind-probed Lucy Nocero  Barton-Massarra believe  but they can t prove  that Human Supremacy launched that robo-bomb at us  that time at the spaceport Have you done anything with those audiovisuals of Leibert 
Gave them to Barton-Massarra  They haven t gotten anything  yet 
want me to do may be a Merlin  we have to assume that it may be dangerous  and we have to assume that Kurt Fawzi and his covey of Merlinolators are just before digging it up  Your job is to see that whatever it is doesn t get loose You haven t found any passage leading into it 
Nifflheim  no! If we had  we d be inside now 
anything but vitrified rock and then the collapsium shielding They do it with cosmic rays But collapsium will stop cosmic rays 
penetrate; it abrades  Throws out a rotary beam and works like a grinding-wheel  or a buzz-saw Well  could you get one down that hole 
there s a full-sized power-reactor  and a mass-energy converter  With them  you produce negamatter--atoms with negatively charged protons and positive electrons  positrons  Then  you have to bring them into contact with normal positive-matte--That s done in a chamber the size of a fifty-gallon barrel  made of collapsium and weighing about a hundred tons  Then you have to have a pseudograv field to impart rotary motion to your cosmic-ray beam  and the generator door that would lift ten ships the size of the  Lester Dawes   Then you need another fifty to a hundred tons of collapsium to shield your cutting-head  The cutting-head alone weighs three tons  The rotary beam that does the cutting about the size of a silver five-centisol piece where that thing is That ll take a year 
Oh  no  Maybe a couple of weeks  after we get started 
here than it will to get that thing uncovered and opened Bless you  young man!
Computer! Those who come after will reckon this the Year Zero of the Age of Regeneration  I will go to my chamber and return thanks in prayer He s been doing a lot of praying lately 
back of the pandenominational chapel on the fourth level down  Always keeps his door locked  too Maybe we could all do with a little prayer Probably praying to Sam Murchison by radio 
I d like to see inside those rooms of his 
humor  I don t know what Fawzi and his gang have here  but if it isn t Merlin it s something just as hot  We want at it  soonest  and we ll have to dig a couple of hundred feet of rock off it and open a collapsium can How are we going to get that stuff on a ship 
last  Can you find engines for it  And is there anything about those mining machines or the cutter that would be damaged by space-radiation or re-entry heat around them  No; that stuff can all be hauled open to space  They use things like that at space stations and on asteroids and all sorts of places  We ll have to stop work on  Ouroboros   though everybody is going to be rich and happy  and live happily forever after You almost said that with a straight face 
of this Merlin stuff you believe So do I  Yves  Maybe after we get this thing open  I ll know 
Ham Matsui and Gomez and Karanja and four or five others  They ll be ready to go to work as soon as she lands and unloads Well  dig out some shootin -irons for them 
need them here Then I m not going either 
stay here and keep an eye on that snake No  nor me 
going to go and pray along with him Genji Gartner s Body

Go ahead  Flora 
harder than making up with Wade was How did that happen  by the way 
Your girlfriend 
forced me into a car and flew me into Storisende  and then made me keep quiet and listen while Wade told me the truth up I had a pretty good idea  though 
I always hated that Merlin thing 
men in Fawzi s office  dreaming about the wonderful things Merlin was going to do  with everything crumbling around them and everybody getting poorer every year  and doing nothing  nothing! And when you were coming home  I was expecting you to tell them there was no Merlin and to go to work and do something for themselves  But you didn t  and I couldn t see what you were trying to do  And then when Wade joined you and Father  I thought he was either helping you put over some kind of a swindle or else he d started believing in Merlin himself  I should have seen what you were trying to do from the beginning  At least  from when you talked them into cleaning the town up and fixing the escalators and getting the fountains going again How s Mother taking things now 
Honestly  I never saw anybody doing that outside a soap opera  Half the time she thinks you and Father are a pair of unprincipled scoundrels  and the other half she thinks you re going to let Merlin destroy the world I m beginning to be afraid of something like that myself 
these people do something they wouldn t do for themselves  aren t you It started that way  What do you think all this is about 
like an awful waste of time  though down there  That s why I m here  instead of on Koshchei  I want to keep people like Fawzi from doing anything foolish with it when they find it But there  can t  be a Merlin!
that thing s too small for that  But there s something down there    telecast range News Service story  recently brought to Aton on the Pan-Federation Spacelines ship  Magellanic   from Terra   Luna    my  aide-de-camp  on Poictesme     now he thinks he s my keeper    There is absolutely no truth in it  gentlemen 
would have shortened the War by years  We did  of course  use computers of all sorts  but they were all the conventional types used by business organizations    lie  Is there no Great Computer Shut up! Listen!
Frankly  I m surprised 
to me  here in this room  a couple of years ago; I told him then that nothing of the sort existed  If he s back on Poictesme telling people there is  he s lying to them and taking advantage of their credulity  There never was anything called Project Merlin    Hah  who s a liar now 
people find in the Library Why  that s right!
find a dozen references to Project Merlin  He couldn t be ignorant of anything like that This youth has been lying to us all along!
false hopes; he has given us faith in a delusion  Why  he is the wickedest monster in human history!Well  thank you  General Travis 
a most excellent statement  sir  It should    Conn  you didn t tell us you d talked to General Travis 
Why didn t you 
Fawzi s office the day I came home; you know how shocked everybody was when I told you I hadn t been able to learn anything positive  Why should I repeat his lies and discourage everybody that much more  Why  he d deny there was a Merlin if he was sitting on top of it Merlin win it for him I don t blame Conn 
some of us might have believed it And look what we found 
Is that Merlin up there  or isn t it 
That little thing!
Merlin  I am going to my chamber  to pray for forgiveness for this wretch Stop him  Tom!
Seems to me you lost faith in Merlin awfully quick 
and you never wanted us to find it Leibert s
Knock it off  Franz; he was only doing his duty 
you  General Shanlee pretty hot  if they have to send a general to handle it on that interview must have been afraid I didn t believe it  which I didn t  When I was ready to graduate  I got this offer of an instructorship; that was a bribe to keep me on Terra and off Poictesme  When I turned it down and took the  Mizar  home  Travis sent Shanlee after me  He must have grown that beard and that pageboy bob on the way out  I suppose he contacted Murchison as soon as he landed  Wait a minute Protection white beard  alias Carl Leibert Just a sec  Mr  Maxwell 
yet them  Let them see those audiovisual  I ll bet that beard was grown aboard ship coming out from Terra Hey  what s going on 
Need help  We ll start a car right away 
Everything s under control  thank you 
that was on telecast a few minutes ago his people  planted here at Force Command  We re going to question him when we have time  But there isn t a word of truth in that statement you just heard on the  Herald-Guardian  newscast  Merlin exists  and we ve found it  We ll have it opened inside of thirty hours at most How close are you to digging that thing out 
We re down to it; we can start cutting the collapsium any time now 
Start cutting it ten minutes ago 
leave Force Command till you have it open  How many men and vehicles does Klem have for defense  You ll need all of them in a couple of hours  Everybody here is stunned  now; they ll come out of it inside an hour  and they ll come out fighting You d better come out here 
Start cutting the can open right away Klem s just ordered all his force out  Are you coming here 
to be here to grab a few of the pieces You ll do a lot of good in jail  or on the end of a rope 
Chance I have to take 
couple of hours  If anybody from the press calls you  what are you going to tell them your end This man s under close arrest 
is very important and very dangerous  Take him out somewhere  search him to the skin  take his clothes away from him and give him a robe  He s to be watched every second; make sure he hasn t poison or other suicide means  He s to be questioned later I ll take it 
Merlin  and we ve found it

lie! Merlin has been found! defrauded; the Planetary Government is the sole complainantgoing to start a false-arrest suit--If you re alive to 
do you think s going to happen when the Stock Exchange opens something like this  He gave me instructions  and instructed a few more people as we can  Nobody who keeps his head is going to lose anything in the long run Well  they caught up with you 
it before things get too bad Have you people started on another hypership yet 
any more ships in to Storisende for a while  And are you sure this thing you ve found is Merlin they d need to operate a thing like Merlin--Yes  Luther  I am sure we have found Merlin anything else that can stop this business We searched Leibert s--Shanlee s--rooms 
We found a bomb 
What kind of a bomb 
by taking apart a couple of light tactical missiles; the whole thing s packed inside a hundred-pound power-cartridge case  It was in a traveling-bag under his bed  And you know how it was to be fired  With a regular 40-mm flare-pistol  welded into the end of the bomb  The flare-powder had been taken out of the cartridge  and it had been reloaded with a big charge of rifle-powder  I suppose it would blow one subcritical mass into another  But the only way he could have fired the bomb would have been by pulling the trigger Have you questioned him yet 
Not yet  I wanted to tell you about it first 
All right  Tom; we ll go talk to him  Where s the Colonel 
now  There s a report of a number of aircraft approaching from the west now    All right; you can go 
We ll take care of him 
You have my name and rank 
My serial number is--
that s all you re getting out of me We ll get anything we want out of you 
a mind-probe is  You should; your accomplices used one on my father s secretary  She s a hopeless imbecile now  You ll be  too  when we re through with you  But before then  you ll have given us everything you know Conn  you can t do a thing like that!
A mind-probe is utterly illegal; why  it s a capital offense!
Conn I forbid you    
Judge  don t make me call those guards and have you removed 
You can stop bluffing 
mind-probe I should imagine it was to be used in interrogating Alliance prisoners  during the War  I think Colonel Zareff would enjoy helping to use it on you  He used to be an Alliance officer honor and integrity  And would you so describe yourself conceal the existence of Merlin  And we found that bomb in your room  You were willing to blow up this headquarters and everybody  yourself included  in it  to keep us from getting at Merlin  Well  you know that we can make you tell us the truth  maybe when it s too late  and you know that we are going to get Merlin  We re cutting the collapsium off that thing above now little thing could be Merlin The controls and programming machine for Merlin 
had it backward  Force Command is inside Merlin What do you mean  Conn 
circuitry  the memory-bank  the relays  everything--was installed inside them  What s up above is only what was needed to operate the computer  Isn t that true  General just overpower you and start mind-probing right away  Now; you feel that suppressing Merlin was worth any sacrifice  We re not unreasonable  If you can convince us that Merlin ought not to be brought to light     Well  you can t do any harm by talking  and you may do some good  You may even accomplish your mission He can t talk us out of it 
They just don t want anybody else to have it No  we don t 
breaking up into bloody anarchy  and that s what ll happen if you dig that thing up and put it into operation Would you mind letting me have one of those 
haven t had a smoke since I came here  It wouldn t have been in character Oh  Brother!
your fellow man; that is a sin All right 
truth  which will be something of a novelty all around even caught Merlin short; information lag  of course  The whole Alliance caved in all at once  Well  we fed Merlin all the data available  and analyzed the situation  Then we did something we really weren t called upon to do  because that was policy-planning and wasn t our province  but we were going to move an occupation army into System States planets  and we didn t want to do anything that would embarrass the Federation Government later  We fed Merlin every scrap of available information on political and economic conditions everywhere in the Federation  and set up a long-term computation of the general effects of the War    The others  who had taken chairs facing him  looked at him blankly    Judge Ledue asked incredulously  
 The Federation would last forever  Anybody knew that  There just couldn t be no more Federation    Shanlee said  
Government will collapse  slowly  The Space Navy will disintegrate  Planets and systems will lose touch with Terra and with one another  You know what it was like here  just before the War  It will be like that on every planet  even on Terra  Just a slow crumbling  till everything is gone; then every planet will start sliding back  in isolation  into barbarism Merlin predicted that 
publication of this prognosis  You know  Merlin can t predict what you or I would do under given circumstances  but Merlin can handle large-group behavior with absolute accuracy  If we made public Merlin s prognosis  the end would come  not in two centuries but in less than one  and it wouldn t be a slow  peaceful decay; it would be a bomb-type reaction  Rebellions  Overthrow of Federation authority  and then revolt and counterrevolt against planetary authority  Division along sectional or class lines on individual planets  Interplanetary wars; what we fought the Alliance to prevent  Left in ignorance of the future  people would go on trying to make do with what they had  But if they found out that the Federation was doomed  everybody would be trying to snatch what they could  and end by smashing everything  Left in ignorance  there might be a planet here and there that would keep enough of the old civilization to serve  in five or so centuries  as a nucleus for a new one  Informed in advance of the doom of the Federation  they would all go down together in the same bloody shambles  and there would be a Galactic night of barbarism for no one knows how many thousand years We don t want anything like that to happen!
with it No! We ll not do that!
tries it!Why didn t you people blow Merlin up 
part of it  We couldn t  Besides  there was a chance that it might survive the Federation; when a new civilization arose  it would be useful  We just sealed it  There were fewer than a hundred of us who knew about it  We all took an oath of secrecy  We spent the rest of our lives trying to suppress any mention of Merlin or the Merlin Project  You have no idea how shocked both General Travis and I were when you told us that the story was still current here on Poictesme  And when we found that you d been getting into the records of the Third Force  I took the next ship I could  a miserable little freighter  and when I landed and found out what was happening  I contacted Murchison and scared the life out of him with stories about a secessionist conspiracy  All this Armageddonist  Human Supremacy  Merlin-is-the-Devil  stuff that s been going on was started by Murchison  And he succeeded in scaring Vyckhoven with the Cybernarchists  too back-work file me beg  again  that you destroy the whole thing We ll have to talk it over among ourselves 
five of us  here  cannot presume to speak for everybody  We will  of course  have to keep you confined; I hope you will understand that we cannot accept your parole Is there anything you want in the meantime 
I would like something to smoke  and some clothes 
And a shave and a haircut

You think it would make all that trouble 
Maybe we had better destroy it 
it s done already; the whole planet s in anarchy  If we let this go on    We can t decide anything like that  just the five of us 
they think  We have no right to make any decision like this for them They re no more able to make the decision than we are 
But we ve got to; they have a right to know    
first I m alive But  Kurt 
Storisende are rioting  It s because they ve lost hope  because they re afraid and desperate  The Terran Federation is something everybody feels they have to have  for peace and order and welfare  If people thought it was breaking up  they d be desperate  too  They d do the same insane things these people here on this planet are doing  General Shanlee was right  Don t destroy the hope that keeps them sane We don t need to do that 
solve our own problems; we don t need to tell the whole Federation what s going to happen in two hundred years It would get out; it couldn t help getting out 
Let s not try to decide it ourselves 
into operation  and run a computation on it not sentence itself to destruction machines; they have no sense of self-preservation  If Merlin ought to be destroyed  Merlin will tell us so You willing to leave it up to Merlin  Kurt 
Yes  If Merlin says we ought to  we ll have to do it 
do not want to use genocidal weapons of mass destruction against the world of our birth  But whether we do or not rests solely with you   Federation naval base and naval arsenal during the War  Here the Federation Navy built their super-missiles  the missiles which devastated Ashmodai  and Belphegor  and Baphomet  and hundreds of these weapons are here  We have them  ready for launching  Once they are launched  with the robo-pilots set for targets on Poictesme  you will have a hundred and sixty hours  at the most  to live   dreadful thing  We speak to each one of you  for each one of you holds the fate of the planet in his own hands They wouldn t do it  would they 
you know those people  They wouldn t really Don t depend on it  Lorenzo 
of people to shoot somebody ten feet away with a pistol  But just sending off a missile; that s nothing but setting a lot of dials and then pushing a button I m not worrying about whether they d do it or not 
I m worrying about is how many people will believe they will What happened 
They let you out on bail 
to charge me with in the first place  But they haven t let me out yet You re wearing your guns 
they re practically keeping me in the safe  I wish our people on Koshchei hadn t mentioned me in their ultimatum; Jake Vyckhoven s afraid to let me run around loose for fear some lunatic shoots me and starts the planetbusters coming in  Jake did one good thing  though  He ordered the Stock Exchange closed  and declared a five-day bank holiday  By that time  you ought to have Merlin opened and working  and then the market ll be safe I hope so 
might talk them into letting you come out here I can try 
I would have come sooner 
collapse  It happened last evening; she s in the hospital  I was with her until just an hour and a half ago  She s still unconscious You mean she s in danger 
was the Travis statement that did it Think I ought to go to her 
isn t anything you can do for her now lying about Merlin There isn t anything we can do  Father 
when there s any change get that infernal thing uncovered  Once we do this  everything ll be all right  We ll show your mother that it isn t a fake and it isn t anything dangerous; we ll put a stop to all these horror-stories about mechanical devils and living machines    This is something worse 
the whole Federation Are you going nuts  too 
Do you believe that 
you saw how people acted  If this story gets out  people will be acting the same way on every planet in the Federation  Not just places like Poictesme; planets like Terra and Baldur and Marduk and Odin and Osiris  It would be the end of everything civilized  everywhere Why didn t they use Merlin to save the Federation 
was what gave it the final shove  If they could have used Merlin to reverse the process  they wouldn t have sealed it away people who went crazy over the Travis statement would go crazy all over again  worse than ever  We d be destroying everything we planned for  and we d be destroying ourselves  That bluff young Macquarte and Luther Chen-Wong and Bill Nichols made wouldn t work twice  And if they weren t bluffing    if it blows up all over the rest of the Federation Well  you got it open 
Now  what are you going to do with it 
We can t make up our minds 
computer tell us what to do with it Merlin judge itself and decide its own fate the same result we did Powered from the central plant  down below 
cables are disguised as the grounding-outlet  If this thing had been on when you put on the power  you d have had an awful lot of power going nowhere  apparently complex  but I d have expected there to be more of it operating end This is the real computer 
where Merlin was; it was all around them Well  how did you get up here 
anything from below No  you couldn t 
Watch this 
That s it 
patched it up a little  There s a sheet of collapsium-plate under the floor  Your scanners simply couldn t detect anything from below You know  we can keep the destruction of Merlin a secret 
the circuits and burn everything out at once I don t know why you people didn t think of that 
neither do I We just didn t 
Then 
room that ll turn out what will look like computation results  As far as anybody outside ourselves will know  Merlin will still be solving everybody s problems  We ll do like any fortuneteller; tell the customer what he wants to believe and keep him happy She s still unconscious  Conn 
breathing  The doctors don t know     I wish Wade hadn t gone on the ship General; you re the oldest Merlin hand 
You do it 
You do it  Conn  None of us would be here except for you 
Thank you  General 
We can t begin to handle this without Merlin 
means blowing up the Federation  let it blow  We ll start a new one here spread to Poictesme question So Merlin s got to be a liar  too  along with the rest of us!
Conn  you ve corrupted his morals!
Well  that s it 
sentence Has the jury reached a verdict 
charged for us  Flora says she seems perfectly normal things till I get back  Sylvie  do you want to come with us

Ah  good afternoon  Mr  Gutchall  Lovely day  isn t it 
a gun and some bullets hurt  and it s suffering something terrible  I want a gun  to put the poor thing out of its pain Why  yes; of course  How would a 20-gauge shotgun do 
You wouldn t want anything heavy 
gun put in my pocket  It wouldn t look right  to carry a hunting gun on the Lord s day; people wouldn t understand that it was for a work of mercy Well  I have a Colt  38-special 
this Auxiliary Police outfit  If I were called out for duty  this evening  I d need it  How soon could you bring it back Dad  aren t there some cartridges left for the Luger 
automatic I can let you have  but I wish you d bring it back as soon as possible  I ll get it for you Sit still  Dad; I ll get it  I know where the cartridges are 
This is Blake Hartley 
Frank Gutchall  who lives at   take this down
shoot a dog  He has no dog  He intends shooting his wife  Don t argue about how I know; there isn t time  Just take it for granted that I do  I disabled the pistol--took out the firing pin--but if he finds out what I did  he may get some other weapon  He s on his way home  but he s on foot  If you hurry  you may get a man there before he arrives  and grab him before he finds out the pistol won t shoot O  K   Mr  Hartley  We ll take care of it  Thanks 
I brought home from the other War  and I shouldn t like to lose it We ll take care of that  too  Thank you  Mr  Hartley 
Look  Mr  Gutchall; here s how it works 
It s ready to shoot  now; this is the safety 
then pull the trigger  You have to pull the trigger each time; it s loaded for eight shots  And be sure to put the safety back when you re through shooting Did you load the chamber 
Sure  It s on safe  now 
Let me see 
right works  now young man You shouldn t have loaded it 
I had to  to keep you from fooling with it 
you finding out that I d taken out the firing pin You what 
to shoot his wife with it  He s a religious maniac; sees visions  hears voices  receives revelations  talks with the Holy Ghost  The Holy Ghost probably put him up to this caper  I ll submit that any man who holds long conversations with the Deity isn t to be trusted with a gun  and neither is any man who lies about why he wants one  And while I was at it  I called the police  on the upstairs phone  I had to use your name; I deepened my voice and talked through a handkerchief You--
do that just thirteen years old; please  Mr  Policeman  go and arrest Frank Gutchall before he goes root-toot-toot at his wife with my pappa s Luger   That would have gone over big  now  wouldn t it be in it  myself  It ll pass for a dumb kid trick  and nothing ll be done  But if I m right  you ll have to front for me  They ll keep your name out of it  but they d give me a lot of cheap boy-hero publicity  which I don t want returns in about twenty minutes Well 
you were right  You saved that woman s life 
let s see you put that firing pin back Now  son  suppose we have a little talk 
But I explained everything 
You did not 
of a trick like this; why  you wouldn t even have known how to take this pistol apart  And at dinner  I caught you using language and expressing ideas that were entirely outside anything you d ever known before  Now  I want to know--and I mean this literally notion of obsession The trouble is  I m not sure you aren t right 
say you find me--changed  When did you first notice a difference Last night  you were still my little boy  This morning--
unusually silent at breakfast  And come to think of it  there was something     something strange     about you when I saw you in the hall  upstairs     Allan!to you I wish I could be sure  myself  Dad 
this morning  I hadn t the least recollection of anything I d done yesterday  August 4  1945  that is convinced that I was a man of forty-three  and my last memory was of lying on a stretcher  injured by a bomb explosion  And I was equally convinced that this had happened in 1975 Huh 
Did you say nineteen  seventy -five 
forty-three  A bomb  you say During the siege of Buffalo  in the Third World War 
been a transpolar air invasion of Canada  and I d been sent to the front to check on service failures of a new lubricating oil for combat equipment  A week after I got there  Ottawa fell  and the retreat started  We made a stand at Buffalo  and that was where I copped it  I remember being picked up  and getting a narcotic injection  The next thing I knew  I was in bed  upstairs  and it was 1945 again  and I was back in my own little thirteen-year-old body Oh  Allan  you just had a nightmare to end nightmares!
That s all!
just wouldn t fit the facts  Look; a normal dream is part of the dreamer s own physical brain  isn t it  Well  here is a part about two thousand per cent greater than the whole from which it was taken  Which is absurd commentators have been harping on the horrors of World War III  and you couldn t have avoided hearing some of it  You just have an undigested chunk of H  V  Kaltenborn raising hell in your subconscious school  and my four years at Penn State  and my seven years as a reporter on the Philadelphia Record  And my novels:   Children of the Mist      Rose of Death      Conqueror s Road    They were no kid stuff  Why  yesterday I d never even have thought of some of the ideas I used in my detective stories  that I published under a  nom-de-plume   And my hobby  chemistry; I was pretty good at that  Patented a couple of processes that made me as much money as my writing  You think a thirteen-year-old just dreamed all that up  Or  here; you speak French  don t you too could cut with a machete  I m even better there than in French  And I know some German  and a little Russian I could barely keep up with you  in French 
that in the last thirteen years of your life  you had absolutely no chance to learn it  All right; you lived till 1975  you say  Then  all of a sudden  you found yourself back here  thirteen years old  in 1945  I suppose you remember everything in between read James Branch Cabell  Remember Florian de Puysange  in  The High Place  Yes  You find the same idea in  Jurgen  too 
I m beginning to wonder if Cabell mightn t have known something he didn t want to write But it s impossible!
time you claim you came from doesn t exist  now; it hasn t happened yet with Time  Psychical Phenomena   Are you trying to work out a theory Yes 
You ve read these books  Well  look  Dad; what s your attitude on precognition  The ability of the human mind to exhibit real knowledge  apart from logical inference  of future events  You think Dunne is telling the truth about his experiences  Or that the cases in Tyrrell s book are properly verified  and can t be explained away on the basis of chance I don t know 
the sort that any court in the world would accept  if it concerned ordinary  normal events  Especially the cases investigated by the Society for Psychical Research: they  have  been verified  But how can anybody know of something that hasn t happened yet  If it hasn t happened yet  it doesn t exist  and you can t have real knowledge of something that has no real existence can  If somebody has real knowledge of the future  then the future must be available to the present mind  And if any moment other than the bare present exists  then all time must be totally present; every moment must be perpetually coexistent with every other moment Yes  I think I see what you mean  That was Dunne s idea  wasn t it 
extent of each being the bare present moment of the next  What I m postulating is the perpetual coexistence of every moment of time in this dimension  just as every graduation on a yardstick exists equally with every other graduation  but each at a different point in space Well  as far as duration and sequence go  that s all right 
But how about the  Passage of Time  
moving car window  I ll suggest that both are illusions of the same kind  We imagine time to be dynamic  because we ve never viewed it from a fixed point  but if it is totally present  then it must be static  and in that case  we re moving through time That seems all right  But what s your car window 
every moment along your individual life span physical body  and your mind  and all the thoughts contained in your mind  each at its appropriate moment in sequence  But what is it that exists only at the bare moment we think of as  now  Please  teacher; what 
But we re only conscious of one moment; the illusory now  This is  now   and it was  now  when you asked that question  and it ll be  now  when I stop talking  but each is a different moment  We imagine that all those nows are rushing past us  Really  they re standing still  and our consciousness is whizzing past them Hey!
moment to moment  it must be extraphysical  because the physical body exists at every moment through which the consciousness passes  And if it s extraphysical  there s no reason whatever for assuming that it passes out of existence when it reaches the moment of the death of the body  Why  there s logical evidence for survival  independent of any alleged spirit communication! You can toss out Patience Worth  and Mrs  Osborne Leonard s Feda  and Sir Oliver Lodge s son  and Wilfred Brandon  and all the other spirit-communicators  and you still have evidence I hadn t thought of that 
Well  let s put that at the bottom of the agenda and get on with this time business  You  lose consciousness  as in sleep; where does your consciousness go  I think it simply detaches from the moment at which you go to sleep  and moves backward or forward along the line of moment-sequence  to some prior or subsequent moment  attaching there Well  why don t we know anything about that 
never seems to happen  We go to sleep tonight  and it s always tomorrow morning when we wake; never day-before-yesterday  or last month  or next year Know why  Because if the consciousness goes forward  it attaches at a moment when the physical brain contains memories of the previous  consciously unexperienced  moment  You wake  remembering the evening before  because that s the memory contained in your mind at that moment  and back of it are memories of all the events in the interim  See Yes  But how about backward movement  like this experience of yours 
case like it  What usually happens is that the memories carried back by the consciousness are buried in the subconscious mind  You know how thick the wall between the subconscious and the conscious mind is  These dreams of Dunne s  and the cases in Tyrrell s book  are leakage  That s why precognitions are usually incomplete and distorted  and generally trivial  The wonder isn t that good cases are so few; it s surprising that there are any at all It may have been the radiations from the bomb  or the effect of the narcotic  or both together  or something at this end  or a combination of all three  But the fact remains that my subconscious barrier didn t function  and everything got through  So  you see  I am obsessed--by my own future identity outsider that what s happened has been a shock  But that other     I just couldn t have taken that was yesterday  I ve just had what you might call an educational short cut I ll say you have!
the next thirty years  suppose you tell me when the War s going to end  This one  I mean present style--on August 14  A week from Tuesday  Better make sure we have plenty of grub in the house by then  Everything will be closed up tight till Thursday morning; even the restaurants  I remember  we had nothing to eat in the house but some scraps Stauber gets plenty of groceries in     Tuesday a week  That s pretty sudden  isn t it The Japs are going to think so 
but I thought it was just Buck Rogers stuff  Was that the sort of bomb that got you good ten miles away years! You know  son  if I were you  I wouldn t like to have to know about a thing like that you know  don t ever tell me when I m going to die the front  You were seventy-eight  then  and you were still hunting  and fishing  and flying your own plane  But I m not going to get killed in any Battle of Buffalo  this time  and if I can prevent it  and I think I can  there won t be any World War III present you re getting closer to it  every watch tick Gutchall came to borrow a gun hadn t been home: I d been swimming at the Canoe Club  with Larry Morton  When I got home  about half an hour from now  I found the house full of cops  Gutchall talked the  38 officers  model out of you  and gone home; he d shot his wife four times through the body  finished her off with another one back of the ear  and then used his sixth shot to blast his brains out  The cops traced the gun; they took a very poor view of your lending it to him  You never got it back Trust that gang to keep a good gun

What did you make this out of  Jim 
notes while you were concocting it  It s good The two smoked pork chops left over from yesterday evening 
in the refrigerator the last couple of days  together with a little egg powder and some milk  I ground the chops up and mixed them with the rice and other stuff  Then added some bacon  to make grease to fry it in Caffchoc 
Did you ever drink coffee  Monty 
organize an expedition to Brazil  sometime  to get seeds and try raising some A much overrated beverage 
when I was on that expedition into Idaho  in what must have been the stockroom of a hotel  Vacuum-packed in moisture-proof containers  and free from radioactivity  It wasn t nearly as good as caffchoc    Loudons looked forward  up the river they were following   he asked  
 Altamont got out his pipe and tobacco pouch  filling the former slowly and carefully     That was Loudons  too  Altamont thought  There wasn t a better man at the Fort  when it came to dealing with people  But confront him with a problem about things and he was lost   That was one of the reasons why he and the stocky  phlegmatic social scientist made such a good team  he thought  As far as he  himself  was concerned  people were just a mysterious  exasperatingly unpredictable order of things which were subject to no known natural laws   And Loudons thought the same thing about machines: he couldn t psychoanalyze them   Altamont gestured with his pipe toward the nuclear-electric conversion unit  between the control-cabin and the living quarters in the rear of the boxcar-sized helicopter    he said  
  Altamont looked across the cabin at the big map of the United States as they had been  the red and green and blue and yellow patchwork of vanished political divisions  The colors gleamed through the transparent overlay on which this voyage of re-discovery was plotted   The red line of their journey started at Fort Ridgeway  in what had been Arizona  It angled east by a little north  to Colony Three  in northern Arkansas     sharply northeast to St  Louis and its lifeless ruins     then to Chicago and Gary  where little bands of Stone Age reversions stalked and fought and ate each other     Detroit  where things that had completely forgotten they were human emerged from their burrows only at night     Cleveland  where a couple of cobalt bombs must have landed in the lake and drenched everything with radioactivity that still lingered after two centuries     Akron  where vegetation was only beginning to break through the glassy slag     Cincinnati  where they had last stopped        transparent nose of the copter at a town  now choked with trees that grew among the tumbled walls   Loudons looked and shrugged  then looked again and pointed    Altamont puffed slowly at his pipe   wiping his mustache with the back of his hand   Altamont said    Loudons qualified  
 They passed over a dam of flotsam that had banked up at a wrecked bridge and accumulated enough mass to resist the periodic floods that had kept the river usually clear  Three human figures fled across a sand-flat at one end of it and disappeared into the woods  Two of them carried spears tipped with something that sparkled in the sunlight  probably shards of glass    Five or six wild cows went crashing through the brush below  Altamont nodded when he saw them    he said  
 He looked across the table   he asked Loudons  
 They rose  and Loudons  favoring his left leg  moved over to the seat at the controls   Altamont gathered up the two cups  the stainless-steel dishes  and the knives and the forks and spoons  going up the steps over the shielded converter and ducking his head to avoid the seat in the forward top machine-gun turret  He washed and dried the dishes  noting with satisfaction that the gauge of the water tank was still reasonably high  and glanced out one of the windows  Loudons was taking the big helicopter upstairs  for a better view   Now and then  among the trees  there would be a glint of glassy slag  usually in a fairly small circle  That was to be expected: beside the three or four H-bombs that had fallen on the Pittsburgh area  mentioned in the transcripts of the last news to reach the Fort from the outside  the whole district had been pelted  more or less at random  with fission bombs   West of the confluence of the Allegheny and the Monongahela  it would probably be worse than this      Picking up the pipe he had laid down  Altamont hurried forward  dodging his six-foot length under the gun turret and swinging down from the walkway over the converter     Loudons had shifted from Forward to Hover and was peering through a pair of binoculars

Look  strip farming 
of grass and plowed ground  These people understand soil conservation    As he spoke  three riders left the village at a gallop  They separated  and the people in the fields  who had all started for the village  turned and began hurrying toward the woods  Two of the riders headed for a pasture in which cattle had been grazing and started herding them also into the woods   For a while  there was a scurrying of little figures in the village below  Then  not a moving thing was in sight    Loudons said  
you understand their background and their social organization what kind of people they are water-power sawmill--building on the left side of the water wheel  see the pile of fresh lumber beside it  Blacksmith shop  and from that chimney  I d say a small foundry  too     Altamont started to object  paused  and then nodded  thought for a moment   The plaza  the houses and the cabins around it  the two-hundred-year-old church  all were silent and apparently lifeless as they set the helicopter down  Once Loudons caught a movement inside the door of a house  and saw a metallic glint    he said  
That would be where they d put it  Probably extract their niter from the dung of their horses and cows  Sulfur probably from coal-mine drainage    looking apprehensively at the brass-rimmed black muzzle that was covering them from the belfry   Three or four young men stepped out of the wide door of the old church  They wore fringed buckskin trousers and buckskin shirts and odd caps of deerskin with visors to shade the eyes and similar beaks behind to protect the neck  They had powder horns and bullet pouches slung over their shoulders  and long rifles in their hands  They stepped aside as soon as they were out  Carefully avoiding any gesture of menace  they simply stood  watching the helicopter which had landed in their village   Three other men followed them out  They  too  wore buckskins and the odd double-visored caps  One had a close-cropped white beard  and on the shoulders of his buckskin shirt  he wore the single silver bars of a first lieutenant of the vanished United States Army  He had a pistol on his belt  The pistol had the saw-handle grip of an automatic  but it was a flintlock  as were the rifles of the young men who stood so watchfully on either side of the door   Two middle-aged men accompanied the bearded man and the trio advanced toward the helicopter    Loudons opened the door and let down the steps  Picking up an auto-carbine  he slung it and stepped out of the helicopter  Altamont behind him  They advanced to meet the party from the church  halting when they were about twenty feet apart    Loudons stopped  wondering if the man with the white beard understood a word of what he was saying   man replied    The old man s eyes sparkled with child-like pleasure  cloth around it is stained with blood  Through the rip  I perceive a bandage  Obviously  you have suffered a recent wound  I further observe that the side of your flying machine bears recent scratches  as though from the spears or throwing hatchets of the Scowrers  Evidently  they attacked you as you were landing  It is fortunate that these cannibal devils are too stupid and too anxious for human flesh to exercise patience attacked been to the west of here  in a ruined city I never guess 
shocking habit--destructive to the logical faculties  What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought   wounded leg  sir  Come in  and let our medic take a look at it Well  thank you  lieutenant 
your medic  I ve attended to the wound myself  and it wasn t serious to begin with You are a doctor 
friend  Mr  Altamont  here  is a scientist  too I am Tenant Mycroft Jones  the Toon Leader here 
is Stamford Rawson  our Reader  and Verner Hughes  our Toon Sarge  This is his son  Murray Hughes  the Toon Sarge of the Irregulars           *       *       *       *       *  By this time  the villagers had begun to emerge from the log cabins and rubble-walled houses around the plaza and the old church  Some of them  mostly the young men  were carrying rifles  but the majority were unarmed  About half of them were women  in short deerskin skirts or homespun dresses  There were a number of children  the younger ones almost completely naked    the old man told one of the youths  
and shouted up at the truncated steeple:  A horn up in the belfry began blowing  apparently to advise the people who had run from the fields into the forest that there was no danger   They went through the open doorway of the old stone church and entered the big room inside  The building had evidently once been gutted by fire  two centuries ago  but portions of the wall had been restored  The floor had been replaced by one of rough planks  and there was a plank ceiling at about ten feet   The room was apparently used as a community center  There were a number of benches and chairs  all very neatly made; and along one wall  out of the way  ten or fifteen long tables had been stacked  the tops in a pile and the trestles on the tops   The walls were decorated with trophies of weapons--a number of M-12 rifles and M-16 submachine-guns  all in good  clean condition; a light machine rifle; two bazookas  Among them were cruder weapons  stone-and metal-tipped spears and clubs  the work of the wild men of the woods   A stairway led to the second floor  and it was up this stairway that the man who bore the title of Toon Leader conducted them  to a small room furnished with a long table  a number of chairs  and several big wooden chests bound with iron   cupboard and producing a large bottle stoppered with a corncob and a number of small cups    he went on  
You smoke a pipe  I take it 
of this  of our own growth and curing You come  then  from the west 
Are you from Utah 
Why  no  we re from Arizona  A place called Fort Ridgeway 
You say you come from a fort  Then the wars aren t over yet 
they were  You know how few in all the countries were left alive you came have managed to save anything of the Old Times  Most of them lived in little villages and cultivated land  A few had horses or cows  None  that we have ever found before  made guns and powder for themselves  But they remembered that they were men  and did not eat one another     the Toon Leader asked  
 He was speaking to Altamont  rather than to Loudons  It seemed obvious that he believed Altamont to be the leader and Loudons the subordinate   Altamont told him  looked at Loudons  aware that his partner should be talking now  and also suddenly aware that Loudons had recognized the situation and left the leadership up to him       beasts will soon be no more He s right  One of us  alone  is helpless 
is only in the Toon that there is strength  He wants to organize a Toon of all Toons one Loudons and I came in  We ll furnish your community with one or more of them  We can give you a radio  so that you can communicate with other communities  We can give you rifles and machine guns and ammunition  to fight the--the Scowrers  did you call them  And we can give you atomic engines  so that you can build machines for yourselves Markovitch  the distiller  and Harrison Grant  the iron-worker--get their living by making things  How d they make out  after your machines came in here we ve helped everything in common and so we don t have much of a problem  Is that the way you do it  here or catches it in the woods  it s his who are already in a trade  or something like that  We ll have to talk it over with you and with the people concerned How is it you took so long finding us 
It s been two hundred or so years since the Wars 
Alex! You see but you do not observe!
complicated mechanisms  They would have to make tools and machines to make them  and tools and machines to make those tools and machines  They would have to find materials  often going in search of them  The marvel is not that they took so long  but that they did it so quickly That s right 
military research and development center  As the country became disorganized  the Government set this project up to develop ways of improvising power and transportation and communication methods and extracting raw materials  If they d had a little more time  they might have saved the country   Fortunately  more than half the technicians at the Fort were women  so there was no question of them dying out     Loudons asked  
  the white-bearded man said  
 The Tenant shook his head in dismay at his stupidity and Loudons found himself forced to say      
IV

excuse our stupidity  We know our history and we should have identified the word accurately   --to Loudons--
 there had been any law  but since there was no law  it was obvious that they could be no crime    Altamont knew without looking at his associate that Loudons would be inconspicuously jotting down notes  The last was an item the sociologist would be sure to record: the white-bearded Tenant had pronounced that reference to a written testament in capital letters   The story was continuing      the platoon   there is nothing in The Books about making gunpowder  The guns in The Books are rifles and shotguns and revolvers and airguns  Except for the airguns  which we haven t been able to make  these all shot cartridges   made laws for ourselves out of them And we are waiting for the Slain and Risen One 
deduce the existence of this community  if He has not done so already Well  sir 
is the future in which you gentlemen are interested   Altamont said  He knew that now he would have to be the one to stress their original mission: Loudons would probably be so fascinated by this society that the sociologist might never remember the primary reason for coming to Pittsburgh    He had no time to wonder at the interchange of glances around the table before the Toon Leader said    The men of the Toon shook their heads  Altamont continued:     exclaimed   told him     Stamford Rawson said happily

Monty  I don t know what the devil to make of this crowd 
Mexico who live in the church and claim that they have a divine mission to redeem the world by prayer  fasting  and flagellation    good reason to remember them    Loudons said  
But this crowd here!
What has you stopped  Jim 
Number of things  Monty  They re hard to explain because--
them   doesn t make sense! Normally  it would take thousands of years for a slain-god religion to develop  and then only in a special situation  from the field-fertility magic of primitive agriculturists     heard Tenant Jones say that they mentioned firearms that used cartridges  That means they can t be older than 1860 at the earliest    Loudons picked up his cigar again    Loudons shook his head disgustedly    Altamont said  
 He smoked in silence for a moment  then added  in an apologetic tone   his memory--decorate his grave regularly  drink toasts to him  and so on  But he hasn t been deified  They got the idea for this god of theirs out of the Sacred Books   Altamont considered the idea  then nodded slowly     returned    paper and scribbled briefly   Altamont looked at the paper  Loudons had simply printed the first three letters of the word in capitals and separated each letter with a period  of it and  especially  I ll keep my mouth shut I don t think you ll be able to

Mr  Altamont! Doctor Loudons!
Are you ready for us now 
I have decided 
Hughes and I would be of more help than an equal number of young men  We may not be as active  but we do know the old ruins better  especially the paths and hiding places of the Scowrers  These four young men you probably met last evening  but it will do no harm to introduce them again     Altamont said  
 He showed them the old picture   he asked  
 commented    To his surprise  he was met with looks of incomprehension  He had not supposed that these people would have lost all memory of radio communication   explanation was concluded   Murray Hughes began  then stopped short  Immediately  he began talking about the rifle that was to be used as a surveying transit  comparing it with the ones in the big first-floor room at the Aitch-Cue House   Locating the point where the shadow of the old Cathedral of Learning had fallen proved easier than either Altamont or Loudons had expected  The towering building was now a tumbled mass of slagged rubble  but it was quite possible to determine its original center  and with the old data from the excellent reference library at Fort Ridgeway  its height above sea level was known  After a little jockeying  the helicopter came to a hovering stop  and the slanting barrel of the rifle in the vise pointed downward along the line of the shadow that had been cast on that afternoon in June  1993   The cross-hairs of the scope sight centered almost exactly on the spot Altamont had estimated on the map   Guiding himself by peering through the rifle-sight  Loudons brought the helicopter slanting down to land on the sheet of fused glass that had once been a grassy campus    Altamont said  
 They began unloading equipment--a small  portable nuclear-electric conversion unit  a powerful solenoid-hammer  crowbars and intrenching tools  tins of blasting plastic  They took out the two hunting rifles and the auto-carbines  and Altamont showed the young men of Murray Hughes  detail how to use them    the Tenant said to Altamont  
 said   They waited until the helicopter had climbed to position and was circling above  and then turned their attention to the place where the sheet of fused earth and stone bulged upward  It must have been almost ground-zero of one of the hydrogen-bombs: the wreckage of the Cathedral of Learning had fallen predominantly to the north  and the Carnegie Library was tumbled to the east   Altamont said   He used the solenoid-hammer  slowly pounding a hole in the glaze  and placed a small charge of the plastic explosive  Chunks of the lava-like stuff pelted down between the little mound and the huge one of the old library  blowing a hole six feet in diameter and the two and a half feet deep  revealing concrete bonded with crushed steel-mill slag    Altamont said  
 He used a second and larger charge  after digging a hole a foot deep  When he and his helpers came up to look  they found a large mass of concrete blown out  and solid steel behind it  Altamont cut two more holes  one on either side of the blown-out place  and fired a charge in each of them  bringing down more concrete   He found he hadn t missed the door after all  It had merely been concreted over   A few more shots cleared it  and after some work  they got it open  There was a room inside  concrete-floored and entirely empty  Altamont stood in the doorway and inspected the interior with his flashlight; he heard somebody behind him say something about a most peculiar sort of dark-lantern   Across the small room  on the opposite wall  was a bronze plaque   The plaque carried quite a lengthy inscription  including the names of all the persons and institutions participating in the microfilm project  The History Department at the Fort would be interested in that  but the only thing that interested Altamont was the statement that the floor had been laid over the trapdoor leading to the vault where the microfilms were stored  He went outside to the radio   he said      The helicopter turned and went windmilling away  over what had been the Golden Triangle  down the Ohio  Altamont went back to the little concrete bunker and sat down  lighting his pipe  Murray Hughes and his four riflemen spread out  one circling around the glazed butte that had been the Cathedral of Learning  another climbing to the top of the old Library  and the others taking positions to the south and east   Altamont sat in silence  smoking his pipe and trying to form some conception of the wealth under that concrete floor   It was no use   Jim Loudons probably understood a little more clearly what those books would mean to the world of today  and what they could do toward shaping the world of the future   There was a library at Fort Ridgeway  and it was an excellent one     for its purpose  In 1996  when the rockets had come crashing down  it had contained the cream of the world s technical knowledge--and very little else  There was only a little fiction  a few books of ideas  just enough to give the survivors a tantalizing glimpse of the world of their fathers   But now             *       *       *       *       *  A rifle banged to the south and east  and banged again  Either Murray Hughes or Birdy Edwards: it was one of the two hunting rifles from the helicopter   On the heels of the reports  they heard a voice shouting   A moment later  there was a light whip-crack of one of the muzzleloaders  from the top of the old Carnegie Library  and Altamont could see a wisp of grey-white smoke drifting away from where it had been fired   Altamont jumped to his feet and raced for the radio  picking it up and bring it to the bunker   Tenant Jones  old Reader Rawson  and Verner Hughes had caught up their rifles  The Tenant was shouting   The boy on top of the library began scrambling down  Another came running from the direction of the half-demolished Cathedral of Learning  a third from the baseball field that had served as Altamont s point of reference the afternoon before   The fourth  Murray Hughes  was running in from the ruins of the old Carnegie Tech buildings  and Birdy Edwards sped up the main road from Schenley Park  Once  twice  as he ran  Murray Hughes paused  turned  and fired behind him   Then his pursuers came into sight!  They ran erect  they wore a few rags of skin garments  and they carried spears and hatchets and clubs  so they were probably classifiable as men  But their hair was long and unkempt  and their bodies were almost black with dirt and from the sun  A few of them were yelling  but most of them ran silently  They ran more swiftly than the boy they were pursuing: the distance between them narrowed every moment  There were at least fifty of them   Verner Hughes  rifle barked  one of them dropped  As cooly as though he were shooting squirrels instead of his son s pursuers  he dropped the butt of the rifle to the ground  poured a charge of powder  patched a ball and rammed it home  replaced the ramrod  Tenant Jones fired then  and Birdy Edwards joined them  beginning to shoot with the telescope-sighted rifle   The young man who had been north of the Cathedral of Learning had one of the auto-carbines; luckily  Altamont had providently set the control for semi-auto before giving it to him  He dropped to one knee and began to empty the clip  shooting slowly and deliberately  picking off the runners who were in the lead   The boy who had started to climb down off the Library halted  fired his flintlock  and began reloading it   Altamont  sitting down and propping his elbows on his knees  took both hands to the automatic which was his only weapon  emptying the magazine and replacing it  The last three savages he shot in the back: they had had enough and were running for their lives   So far  everybody was safe  The boy in the Library came down through a place where the wall had fallen  Murray Hughes stopped running and came slowly toward the bunker  putting a fresh clip into his rifle  The others came drifting in          *       *       *       *       *  saying into the radio   Silence     Tenant Jones said  
 radio; and as he did  he knew the answer  Loudons was in the village  away from the helicopter  gathering tools and workers   Nothing to do but keep on trying!   to know   Altamont straightened  saw the second band of savages approaching about four hundred yards away    he said  
 The two auto-loading rifles began to crack  After the first few shots  the savages took cover  Evidently they understood the capabilities and limitations of the villagers  flintlocks  but this was a terrifying surprise to them   --Altamont was almost praying into the radio--
  Altamont told him       A naked savage raised his head from behind what might  two hundred years ago  have been a cement park-bench and he was only a hundred yards away  Reader Rawson promptly killed him and began reloading    he said  
  Altamont wondered what they were double-talking about  There wasn t any particular mystery about the mass attack of the wild men to him   Debased as they were  they still possessed speech and the ability to transmit experiences  No matter how beclouded in superstition  they still remembered that aircraft dropped bombs  and bombs killed people  and where people had been killed  they would find fresh meat  They had seen the helicopter circling about  and had heard the blasting: everyone in the area had been drawn to the scene as soon as Loudons had gone down the river   But they seemed to have forgotten that aircraft carried guns  although they did spring to their feet and start to run at the return of the helicopter   However  most of them did not run far

handing him a big loose-leaf book  which he opened with the reverence a Literate always displayed toward the written word   They all looked at one another  thunderstruck    said   Mongery  in the screen  continued  deprecatingly over his white smock and fingered the badges on his belt   Organization who want just that  Chester Pelton knows that we cannot abolish Literacy entirely  Even with modern audio-visual recording  need exists for some modicum of written recording  which can be rapidly scanned and selected from--indexing  cataloguing  tabulating data  et cetera--and for at least a few men and women who can form and interpret the written word  Mr  Pelton  himself  is the owner of a huge department store  employing over a thousand Illiterates; he must at all times have the services of at least fifty Literates And pays through the nose for them  too!
 fellahin  barbarism  and here I definitely part company with Mr  Pelton  he fears the potential power of organized Literacy  In a word  he fears a future Literate Dictatorship Future  What do you think we have now 
Nobody 
today  to want to be a dictator  That ended by the middle of the Twenty-first Century  Everybody knows what happened to Mussolini  and Hitler  and Stalin  and all their imitators  Why  it is as much the public fear of Big Government as the breakdown of civil power because of the administrative handicap of a shortage of Literate administrators that is responsible for the disgraceful lawlessness of the past hundred years  Thus  it speaks well for the public trust in Chester Pelton s known integrity and sincerity that so many of our people are willing to agree to his program for socialized Literacy  They feel that he can be trusted  and  violently as I disagree with him  I can only say that that trust is not misplaced    Mongery paused  paper  at which he glanced  Then he laughed heartily    He cocked an eye at the audience  
 He raised his hand to his audience  
  Ray said  
  Chester Pelton said  
  He turned  Olaf Olafsson  the  copter driver  was standing at the entrance to the breakfast nook  a smudge of oil on his cheek and his straw-colored hair in disorder   less surprised had the ceiling fallen in      Olaf said in disgust  as though at something obscene  
  Ray agreed  
  Pelton started to his feet  Claire unlocked the table and slid it out of his way  Ray  on a run  started for the lift and vanished    he fumed  
went to the lift  and found the door closed in their faces   Claire pressed the button  Ray must have left the lift  for the operating light went on  and in a moment the door opened  He crowded into the lift  along with his daughter and Olaf   On the landing stage  Ray was already in the  copter  poking at buttons on the board    he called  
obediently into place-- An ugly suspicion stabbed at Chester Pelton  bringing with it a feeling of frightened horror    Ray s eyes remained on the instrument board  He pushed another button  and the propeller began swinging in a lazy circle; he pressed down with his right foot  and the  copter lifted a foot or so    he asked  
down again   The suspicion  and the horror passed in a wave of relief   he asked     He watched the  copter rise to the two thousand foot local traffic level and turn in the direction of Mineola High School  fifty miles away  He was still looking anxiously after it as it dwindled to a tiny dot and vanished    Claire told him  
 ashamed  at his daughter   given him when he had announced his candidacy for Senate  in the spring      Claire wrinkled her brow--just like her mother  when she was trying to remember something           *       *       *       *       *  Literate First Class Ralph N  Prestonby remained standing by the lectern  looking out over the crowded auditorium  still pleasantly surprised to estimate the day s attendance at something like ninety-seven per cent of enrollment  That was really good; why  it was only three per cent short of perfect! Maybe it was the new rule requiring a sound-recorded excuse for absence  Or it could have been his propaganda campaign about the benefits of education  Or  very easily  it could have been the result of sending Doug Yetsko and some of his boys around to talk to recalcitrant parents  It was good to see that that was having some effect beside an increase in the number of attempts on his life  or the flood of complaints to the Board of Education  Well  Lancedale had gotten Education merged with his Office of Communications  and Lancedale was back of him to the limit  so the complaints had died out on the empty air  And Doug Yetsko was his bodyguard  so most of the would-be assassins had died  also   The  which had replaced the 
end  The students and their white-smocked teachers  below  relaxed from attention; most of them sat down  while monitors and teachers in the rear were getting the students into the aisles and marching them off to study halls and classrooms and workshops  The orchestra struck up a lively march tune  He leaned his left elbow--Literates learned early  or did not live to learn  not to immobilize the right hand--on the lectern and watched the interminable business of getting the students marched out  yearning  as he always did at this time  for the privacy of his office  where he could smoke his pipe  Finally  they were all gone  and the orchestra had gathered up its instruments and filed out into the wings of the stage  and he looked up to the left and said  softly:   With a soft thud  the big man dropped down from the guard s cubicle overhead  grinning cheerfully  He needed a shave--Yetsko always did  in the mornings--and in his leather Literates  guard uniform  he looked like some ogreish giant out of the mythology of the past   [Illustration:]  Prestonby said   of his cubicle; he seemed surprised at Prestonby s obtuseness   Prestonby gave a snort of disgust    Yetsko said  
 Prestonby nodded  Just a week before  a crude but perfectly operative 17-mm shotgun had been discovered in the last stages of manufacture in the machine shop  and five out of six of the worn-out files would vanish  to be ground down into dirks  He often thought of the stories of his grandfather  who had been a major during the Occupation of Russia  after the Fourth World War  Those old-timers didn t know how easy they d had it; they should have tried to run an Illiterate high school   Yetsko was still grumbling slanders on the legitimacy of the student body   he falsettoed incongruously  
Education and the tax-paying public that was probably subversive within the meaning of the Loyalty Oath   last week  a dozen pupils had been seriously cut or blackjacked in hall and locker-room fights    Yetsko comforted him  
        *       *       *       *       *  Prestonby took the thick-barreled gas pistol from the shelf under the lectern and shoved it into his hip pocket; Yetsko picked up a two-and-a-half foot length of rubber hose and tucked it under his left arm  Together  they went back through the wings and out into the hallway that led to the office  So a Twenty-second Century high school was a place where a teacher carried a pistol and a tear-gas projector and a sleep-gas gun  and had a bodyguard  and still walked in danger of his life from armed  teen-age hooligans  It was meaningless to ask whose fault it was  There had been the World Wars  and the cold-war interbellum periods--rising birth rates  huge demands on the public treasury for armaments  with the public taxed to the saturation point  and no money left for the schools  There had been fantastic Twentieth Century  in the big cities  children were being pushed through grade school without having learned to read  And when there had been money available for education  school boards had insisted on spending it for audio-visual equipment  recordings  films  anything but textbooks  And there had been that lunatic theory that children should be taught to read by recognizing whole words instead of learning the alphabet  And more and more illiterates had been shoved out of the schools  into a world where radio and television and moving pictures were supplanting books and newspapers  and more and more children of illiterates had gone to school without any desire or incentive to learn to read  And finally  the illiterates had become Illiterates  and literacy had become Literacy   And now  the Associated Fraternities of Literates had come to monopolize the ability to read and write  and a few men like William R  Lancedale  with a handful of followers like Ralph N  Prestonby  were trying--  The gleaming cleanliness of the corridor  as always  heartened Prestonby a little; it was a trophy of victory from his first two days at Mineola High School  three years ago  He remembered what they had looked like when he had first seen them    The janitors  all political appointees  Independent-Conservative party-hacks  secure in their jobs  had laughed derisively  The building superintendent  without troubling to rise  had answered him:  said   The fellow s name  he recalled  was Kettner; Lancedale had given him a briefing which had included some particulars about him  He was an Independent-Conservative ward-committeeman  He had gotten his present job after being fired from his former position as mailman for listening to other peoples  mail with his pocket recorder-reproducer    he had said  
 out of his chair with one hand and started for the door with him    Thinking that he was backing down  they had all begun grinning at him    he had said  
 After the third kick  Kettner had gotten the door open  himself; the fourth kick sent him across the hall to the opposite wall  He pulled himself to his feet and limped away  never to return  The next morning  the school was spotless  It had stayed that way   Beside him  Yetsko must also have returned mentally to the past       No  he didn t  either  If he d never have come to Mineola High School  he d never have found Claire Pelton          *       *       *       *       *  Sitting down again at the breakfast table with her father  Claire levered another cigarette out of the Readilit and puffed at it with exaggeratedly bored slowness  She was still frightened  Ray shouldn t have done what he did  even if he had furnished a plausible explanation  The trouble with plausible explanations was having to make them  Sooner or later  you made too many  and then you made one that wasn t so plausible  and then all the others were remembered  and they all looked phony  And why had the Senator had to mention Ralph  Was he beginning to suspect the truth about that  too   I hope not! she thought desperately  If he ever found out about that  it d kill him  Just kill him  period!  Mrs  Harris must have turned off the video  after they had gone up to the landing stage  To cover her nervousness  she reached up and snapped it on again  The screen lit  and from it a young man with dark eyes under bushy black brows was shouting angrily:   His hand went to his hip  and then  realizing that he was unarmed and  in any case  confronted only by an electronic image  he sat down again   continued   The screen went suddenly dark  Her father turned  to catch her with her hand still on the switch     He reached toward the Readilit for a cigarette  then his hand stopped  His face was contorted with pain; he gave a gasp of suffocation   Claire cried in dismay:    spasm of pain had passed  He filled his coffee cup and sipped from it     Frank again  She frowned    she said  
  her father protested  
        *       *       *       *       *  Frank Cardon stood on the sidewalk  looking approvingly into the window of O Reilly s Tavern  in which his display crew had already set up the spread for the current week  On either side was a giant six-foot replica  in black glass  of the Cardon bottle  in the conventional shape accepted by an Illiterate public as containing beer  bearing the red Cardon label with its pictured bottle in a central white disk  Because of the heroic size of the bottles  the pictured bottle on the label bore a bottle bearing a label bearing a bottle bearing a bottle on a label     He counted eight pictured bottles  down to the tiniest dot of black  There were four-foot bottles next to the six-foot bottles  and three-foot bottles next to them  and  in the middle background  a life-size tri-dimensional picture of an almost nude and incredibly pulchritudinous young lady smiling in invitation at the passing throng and extending a foaming bottle of Cardon s in her hand  Aside from the printed trademark-registry statements on the labels  there was not a printed word visible in the window   He pushed through the swinging doors and looked down the long room  with the chairs still roosting sleepily on the tables  and made a quick count of the early drinkers  two thirds of them in white smocks and Sam Browne belts  obviously from Literates  Hall  across the street  Late drinkers  he corrected himself mentally; they d be the night shift  having their drinks before going home    the bartender greeted him  
  Cardon told him  
folded a C-bill accordion-wise and set it on edge on the bar   announced  then lowered his voice  building across the street   of him  accepted the thanks of the house  and  when the bartender brought the fifteen-dollars-odd change from the dozen drinks  he pushed it back   He drank slowly  looking around the room  then set down his empty glass and went back  past two doors which bore pictured half-doors revealing  respectively  masculine-trousered and feminine-stockinged ankles  and opened the unmarked office door beyond  The bartender  he knew  had pushed the signal button; the door was unlocked  and  inside  O Reilly--baptismal name Luigi Orelli--was waiting    The brewer nodded  inside   The corner cupboard  which was an elevator  took him to a tunnel below the street  Across the street  he entered another elevator  set the indicator for the tenth floor  and ascended  As the car rose  he could feel the personality of Frank Cardon  Illiterate brewer  drop from him  as though he were an actor returning from the stage to his dressing room   The room into which he emerged was almost that  There was a long table  at which two white-smocked Literates drank coffee and went over some papers; a third Literate sprawled in a deep chair  resting; at a small table  four men in black shirts and leather breeches and field boots played poker  while a fifth  who had just entered and had not yet removed his leather helmet and jacket or his weapons belt  stood watching them   Cardon went to a row of lockers along the wall  opened one  and took out a white smock  pulling it over his head and zipping it up to the throat  Then he buckled on a Sam Browne with its tablet holster and stylus gas projector  The Literate sprawling in the chair opened one eye     Cardon replied  
 He passed through the door across from the elevator  went down a short hall  and spoke in greeting to the leather-jacketed storm trooper on guard outside the door at the other end    the guard nodded  
  He opened the door and went through  William R  Lancedale rose from behind his desk and advanced to greet him with a quick handshake  guiding him to a chair beside the desk  As he did  he sniffed and raised an eyebrow     Cardon replied  
 Literate executive resumed his seat  passing a hand back and forth slowly across the face of the commo  the diamond on his finger twinkling  and gave brief instructions   They were both silent as a novice Literate bustled in with coffee and individually-sealed cigars    Cardon said  
 Lancedale s thin face broke into a smile  little wrinkles putting his mouth in parentheses  Cardon sampled the coffee  and then used a Sixteenth Century Italian stiletto from Lancedale s desk to perforate the end of his cigar   said   Lancedale nodded    Lancedale consigned the brewery to perdition    Cardon said  
  Lancedale said  
 Cardon shook his head  Lancedale handed over a little half-inch  thirty-minute  record disk    he said  
 Cardon put the disk in his pocket recorder and set it for play-back  putting the plug in his ear  After a while  he shut it off and took out the ear plug    Lancedale shrugged   he countered  
 Cardon thought for a moment   he decided  
  Lancedale agreed  
  Lancedale nodded     the stiletto  which he still held      Cardon said    Lancedale added  
 grimaced    Lancedale said  
 He walked with O Reilly to the street door  talking about tomorrow s election; after shaking hands with the saloon keeper  he crossed the sidewalk and stepped onto the beltway  moving across the strips until he came to the twenty m p h  strip  The tall office buildings of upper Yonkers Borough marched away as he stood on the strip  appreciatively puffing at Lancedale s cigar  The character of the street changed; the buildings grew lower  and the quiet and fashionable ground-floor shops and cafés gave place to bargain stores  their audio-advertisers whooping urgently about improbable prices and offerings  and garish  noisy  crowded bars and cafeterias blaring recorded popular music  There was quite a bit of political advertising in evidence--huge pictures of the two major senatorial candidates  He estimated that Chester Pelton s bald head and bulldog features appeared twice for every one of Grant Hamilton s white locks  old-fashioned spectacles and self-satisfied smirk   Then he came to the building on which he had parked his  copter  and left the beltway  entering and riding up to the landing stage on the helical escalator  There seemed to have been some trouble; about a dozen Independent-Conservative storm troopers  in their white robes and hoods  with the fiery-cross emblem on their breasts  were bunched together  most of them with their right hands inside their bosoms  while a similar group of Radical-Conservative storm troopers  with their black sombreros and little black masks  stood watching them and fingering the white-handled pistols they wore in pairs on their belts  Between the two groups were four city policemen  looking acutely unhappy   The group in the Lone Ranger uniforms  he saw  were standing in front of a huge tri-dimensional animated portrait of Chester Pelton  As he watched  the pictured candidate raised a clenched fist  and Pelton s recorded and amplified voice thundered:   He recognized the group leader of the Radical-Socialists--the masks were too small to be more than token disguises--and beckoned to him  at the same time walking toward his  copter  The man in black with the white-handled pistols followed him  spurs jingling    he said  joining him  
 the huge tridianimate bellowed   Over in Queens  the Independents had managed to get at a similar tridianimate  had taken out the record  and had put in one:  I am a lying fraud! Vote for Grant Hamilton and liberty and sound government!    he approved  
  Goodkin replied  
 Cardon nodded   He climbed into his own  copter and started the motor   roared triumphantly after the retreating Independents          *       *       *       *       *  At eight thousand  he got the  copter onto the lower Manhattan beam and relaxed  First of all  he d have to do something about answering Slade Gardner s telecast propaganda  That stuff was dangerous  The answer ought to go on the air by noon  and should be stepped up through the afternoon  First as a straight news story; Elliot Mongery had fifteen minutes  beginning at 1215--no  that wouldn t do  Mongery s sponsor for that time was Atomflame Heaters  and Atomflame was a subsidiary of Canada Northwest Fissionables  and Canada Northwest was umbilicus-deep in that Kettle River lease graft that Pelton had sworn to get investigated as soon as he took office  Professional ethics wouldn t allow Mongery to say anything in Pelton s behalf on Atomflame s time  Well  there was Guthrie Parham  he came on at 1245  and his sponsor was all right  He d call Parham and tell him what he wanted done   [Illustration:]  The buzzer warned him that he was approaching the lower Manhattan beacon; he shifted to manual control  dropped down to the three-thousand-foot level  and set his selector beam for the signal from Pelton s Purchasers  Paradise  Down toward the tip of the island  in the section that had been rebuilt after that Stalin Mark XV guided missile had gotten through the counter-rocket defenses in 1987  he could see the quadrate cross of his goal  with public landing stages on each of the four arms  and the higher central block with its landing stage for freight and store personnel  Above the four public stages  helicopters swarmed like May flies--May flies which had mutated and invented ritual or military drill or choreography--coming in in four streams to the tips of the arms and rising vertically from the middle  There was about ten times the normal amount of traffic for this early in the morning  He wondered  briefly  then remembered  and cursed  That infernal sale!  Grudgingly  he respected Russell Latterman s smartness  and in consequence  the ability of Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves in selecting a good agent to plant in Pelton s store  Latterman gave a plausible impersonation of the Illiterate businessman  loyal Prime Minister of Pelton s commercial empire  Generalissimo in the perpetual war against Macy & Gimbel s  From that viewpoint  the sale was excellent business--Latterman had gotten the jump on all the other department stores for the winter fashions and fall sports trade  He had also turned the store into a madhouse at the exact time when Chester Pelton needed to give all his attention to the election   Pressing the button that put on his private recognition signal  he rose above the incoming customers and began to drop toward the private landing stage  circling to get a view of the other four stages  Maybe the sale could be turned to some advantage  at that  A free souvenir with each purchase  carrying a Pelton-for-Senator picture-message--  He broke off  peering down at the five-hundred-foot-square landing stage above the central block  then brought his  copter swooping down rapidly  The white-clad figures he had seen swarming up the helical escalator were not wearing the Ku Klux robes of the Independent-Conservative storm troops  as he had first feared--they were in Literate smocks  and among them were the black leather jackets and futuristic helmets of their guards  They were led  he saw  by Stephen S  Bayne  the store s Chief Literate; with him were his assistant  Literate Third Class Roger B  Feinberg  and the novices carrying books and briefcases and cased typewriters  and the guards  and every Literate employed in the store  Four or five men in ordinarily vivid-colored business suits were obviously expostulating about something  As he landed and threw back the transparent canopy  he could hear a babel of voices  above which Feinberg was crying:  He jumped out and hurried over          *       *       *       *       *  clothes was protesting   Bayne  his thin face livid with anger--and also  Cardon noticed  with what looked like a couple of fresh bruises--ignored him  Feinberg broke off his chant of   Cardon grabbed the blue-and-orange clad man and dragged him to one side       Cardon felt his face tighten into a frown of perplexity  That wasn t like Literate First Class Stephen S  Bayne  He made quite a hobby of pinching salesgirls behind the counter which was one thing; the boss  daughter was quite another     Cardon swore and ran for the descending escalator  running down the rotating spiral to the executive floor and jumping off into the gawking mob of Illiterate clerks crowded in the open doors of Pelton s office  He hit and shoved and elbowed and cursed them out of the way  and burst into the big room beyond  and then  for a moment  he was almost sorry he had come   Pelton was slumped in his big relaxer chair  his face pale and twisted in pain  his breath coming in feeble gasps  His daughter was beside him  her blond head bent over him; Russell Latterman was standing to one side  watching intently  For an instant  Cardon was reminded of a tomcat watching a promising mouse hole    Cardon exploded  
 Claire turned  desperate eyes   He shot a quick glance at Latterman  catching the sales manager before he could erase a look of triumph from his face  Things began to add up  Latterman  of course  was the undercover man for Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves and the rest of the Conservative faction at Literates  Hall  just as he  himself  was Lancedale s agent  Obsessed with immediate advantages and disadvantages  the Joyner-Graves faction wanted to secure the re-election of Grant Hamilton  and the way things had been going in the past two months  only Chester Pelton s death could accomplish that  Latterman had probably thrown out Pelton s nitrocaine capsules and then put Bayne up to insulting Pelton s daughter  knowing that a fit of rage would bring on another heart attack  which could be fatal without the medicine     The office safe was locked  and only a Literate could open it  The double combination was neatly stenciled on the door  the numbers spelled out as words and the letters spelled in phonetic equivalents  All three of them--himself  Claire  and Russell Latterman--could read them  None of them dared admit it  Latterman was fairly licking his chops in anticipation  If Cardon opened the safe  Pelton s campaign manager stood convicted as a Literate  If Claire opened it  the gaggle of Illiterate clerks in the doorway would see  and speedily spread the news  that the daughter of the arch-foe of Literacy was herself able to read  Maybe Latterman hadn t really intended his employer to die  Maybe this was the situation he had really intended to contrive   Chester Pelton couldn t be allowed to die  If Grant Hamilton were returned to the Senate  the long-range planning of William Lancedale would suffer a crushing setback  and the public reaction would be catastrophic   The Plan comes first   Lancedale had told him  He made his decision  and then saw that he hadn t needed to make it  Claire had straightened  left her father  crossed quickly to the safe  and was kneeling in front of it  her back stiff with determination  her fingers busy at the dials  her eyes going from them to the printed combination and back again  She swung open the door  skimmed through the papers inside  unerringly selected the prescription  and rose    she ordered  
 Oh  no  you don t  Cardon thought  One chance is enough for you  Russ  He snatched the prescription from her and turned to Latterman    he told the sales manager  
  Cardon blazed: pistol that had been taken from Pelton when he had tried to draw it on Bayne  checking the chamber and setting the safety   he asked Claire  
 He gave her no chance to argue  Pushing Latterman ahead of him  he drove through the mob of clerks outside the door    
 A couple of centuries ago  they would have talked like that if it had been discovered that the girl were pregnant; a couple of centuries before that  they would have been equally horrified if she had been discovered to have been a Protestant  or a Catholic  or whatever the locally unpopular religion happened to be  By noon  this would be all over Penn-Jersey-York; coming on top of Slade Gardner s accusations--         *       *       *       *       *  He ran up the spiral escalator  stumbling and regaining his footing as he left it  Bayne and his striking Literates were all gone; he saw a sergeant of Pelton s store police and went toward him  taking his spare identity-badge from his pocket    he said  handing it to the sergeant  
   He jumped into his  copter  pulled forward the plexiglass canopy  and took off vertically to ten thousand feet  then  orienting himself  swooped downward toward a landing stage on the other side of the East River  cutting across traffic levels with an utter contempt for regulations   The building on which he landed was one of the principal pharmacies; he spiraled down on the escalator to the main floor and went directly to the Literate in charge  noticing that he wore on his Sam Browne not only the badges of retail-merchandising  pharmacist and graduate chemist but also that of medic-in-training  Snatching a pad and pencil from a counter  he wrote hastily:  Your private office  at once; urgent and important    Looking at it  the Literate nodded in recognition of Cardon s Literacy   office    Cardon gave him the prescription  
 glancing at it  black Mexican jacket-- Cardon had his pocket recorder in his hand  He held it out  pressing a concealed stud; the stylus-and-tablet insignia glowed redly on it for a moment  then vanished  The uniformed Literate nodded   Literate  who had not recognized him before  opened his eyes at the name and whistled softly   The man in the Literate smock nodded and hurried out  Cardon dialed William R  Lancedale s private number  When Lancedale s thin  intense face appeared on the screen  he reported swiftly    he finished  
  Cardon laughed with mirthless harshness   went with a pause for semantic re-integration     He considered for a moment  
 Breaking the connection  Cardon dialed again  A girl s face  over a Literate Third Class smock  appeared in the screen; a lovely golden voice chimed at him:           *       *       *       *       *  Ralph Prestonby cleared his throat  slipped a master disk into the recording machine beside his desk  and pressed the start button    he began

put-up job  Something s going to happen to Russ Latterman  one of these days I think you d better let Frank Cardon take care of him  Ray 
me  Now  I m going over to the store  Somebody s got to stay with Claire  I want you to stay here  in this room  If anybody sends you any message supposed to be from me  just ignore it  It ll be a trap  If I want to get in touch with you  I ll call you  with vision-image to withdraw  or something You catch on quickly  Ray 
with Ray till I get back  Don t let him out of your sight for an instant  At noon  have Miss Collins get lunches for both of you sent up; if I m not back by fifteen-hundred  take him to his home  and stay with him there Hold it!
when it happened  and saw everything of you! Our boss  and-- if he lives --our next senator  was the victim of a deliberate murder attempt  by Literate First Class Bayne  who threw out his supply of nitrocaine bulbs and then goaded him into a heart attack which  except for his daughter  would have been fatal  Claire Pelton deserves the deepest gratitude of every Radical-Socialist in the state  She s a smart girl  and she saved the life of her father and our leader    he cried loudly  
 Looking around  he caught sight of a pair who seemed something less than impressed with his account of it  Joe West  thick-armed  hairy-chested  blue-jowled; Horace Yingling  thin and gangling  They weren t Radical-Socialist party people; they were from the Political Action Committee of the Consolidated Illiterates Organization  and their slogan was simpler and more to the point than Chester Pelton s--the only good Literate is a dead Literate  He tensed himself and challenged them directly    Yingling looked at West  and West looked back at him questioningly  Evidently the  suavitor in modo  was Yingling s province  and the  fortior in re  was West s    Yingling said dubiously  
        *       *       *       *       *  It was worse than that in some of the other boroughs  One fanatic  imagining that Cardon himself was a crypto-Literate  drew a gun  Cardon s guards disarmed him and beat him senseless  At another headquarters  some character was circulating about declaring that not only Claire Pelton but her younger brother  Ray  as well  were Literates  Cardon s two men hustled him out of the building  and  after about twenty minutes  returned alone  Cardon hoped that the body would not be found until after the polls closed  the next day   Finally  leaving his guards with the  copter at a public landing stage  he made his way  by devious routes  to William R  Lancedale s office  and found Lancedale at his desk  seeming not to have moved since he had showed his agent out earlier in the day   him    Lancedale told him  
   Lancedale smiled  
 The buzzer on Lancedale s desk interrupted  and a voice came out of the commo box:   Cardon recognized the name  Maybe the Independent-Conservatives have troubles  too  he thought hopefully  Then Lancedale s video screen became the frame for an almost unbelievably commonplace set of features    the man in the screen said  
 directed   nodded and vanished from the screen    considered   photoelectric eye of the commo box  and  a little later  intelligence report and the conclusions drawn from it  The guards officer repeated back his instructions  and Lancedale broke the connection    he said  
        *       *       *       *       *  A couple of men in the maroon uniform of Pelton s store police were waiting as Prestonby s  copter landed on the top stage; one of them touched his cap-visor with his gas-billy in salute and said:  He had hoped to find her alone  but when he entered the office  he saw five or six of the store personnel with her  Since opening her father s safe  she had evidently dropped all pretense of Illiteracy; there was a mass of papers spread on the big desk  and she was referring from one to another of them with the deft skill of a regular Fraternities Literate  while the others watched in fascinated horror   the blue and orange business suit with whom she had been talking  and laid the printed price-schedule down  advancing to meet him    she greeted him  
 For a moment  he thought of the afternoon  over two years ago  when she had entered his office at the school  and he had recognized her as the older sister of young Ray Pelton    she had begun  accusingly  
 He had been prepared for that; had known that sooner or later there would be some minor leak in the security screen around the classrooms on the top floor    he had protested pleasantly  
   he had parried  
  she had replied coolly  
 Now  with this gang of her father s Illiterate store officials present  a quick handclasp and a glance were all they could exchange    She led him to a door at the rear of the office and motioned him to enter  following him   The room was a sort of bedroom and dressing room  with a miniscule toilet and shower beyond  Pelton was lying on his back  sleeping; his face was pale  but he was breathing easily and regularly  Two of the store policemen  a sergeant and a patrolman  were playing cards on the little table  and the patrolman had a burp gun within reach    Claire said  
 The sergeant started to protest  Claire cut him off    The two rose and went out  leaving the door barely ajar  Prestonby and Claire  like a pair of marionettes on the same set of strings  cast a quick glance at the door and then were in each other s arms  Chester Pelton slept placidly as they kissed and whispered endearments   It was Claire who terminated the embrace  looking apprehensively at her slumbering father    she asked  
 Prestonby thought furiously  trying to find a safe path through the tangle of Claire Pelton s conflicting loyalties  trying to find a path between his own loyalties and his love for her  wondering how much it would be safe to tell her     Her eyes widened   she said  
 Somebody rapped on the door  called   Prestonby smiled   he said  
 She followed him as he went out into Pelton s office  When he snapped on the screen  a young man in a white smock  with the Fraternities Executive Section badge  looked out of it  He gave a slight start when he saw Prestonby    screen replied    Armandez announced     Prestonby asked   The man in the screen consulted his watch   and their implications   The Literate in the screen blinked; that was the equivalent  for him  of anybody else s jaw dropping to his midriff           *       *       *       *       *  catch her attention       reminded her   The man--Hutschnecker  Prestonby remembered hearing Claire call him--nodded    A buzzer drew one of the Illiterates to a handphone  He listened for a moment  and turned    Claire handed Prestonby a black-bound book   Another buzzer rasped  before Prestonby could find the entry on Zydanowycz  H  Armytage; the Illiterate office worker  laying down one phone  grabbed up another     Hutschnecker said  
 asked    Claire said  
  across the desk to him          *       *       *       *       *  It went on  like that  for the next hour  When the new Literate crew arrived  Prestonby was delighted to find a friend  and a fellow-follower of Lancedale  in charge  Considering that Retail Merchandising was Wilton Joyner s section  that was a good omen  Lancedale must have succeeded to an extraordinary degree in imposing his will on the Grand Council  Prestonby found  however  that he would need some time to brief the new chief Literate on the operational details at the store  He was unwilling to bring Claire too prominently into the conference  although he realized that it would be a matter of half an hour  at the outside  before every one of the new Literate crew would have heard about her Literate ability  If she d only played dumb  after opening that safe--  Finally  by 1300  the new Literates had taken over  and the sale was running smoothly again  Latterman was somewhere out in the store  helping them; Claire had lunch for herself and Prestonby sent up from the restaurant  and for a while they ate in silence  broken by occasional spatters of small-talk  Then she returned to the question she had raised and he had not yet answered    she asked  
 He shook his head   He paused  thinking quickly  If Lancedale had gotten the upper hand  there was likely to be a revision of the Joyner-Graves attitude toward Pelton  In that case  the less he said to incriminate Russell Latterman  the better  Let Bayne be the villain  for a while  he decided    he continued  
William R  Lancedale  I m of his faction  and so is Frank Cardon  We want to see your father elected  because the socialization of Literacy would eventually put the Literates in complete control of the government  We also want to see Literacy become widespread  eventually universal  just as it was before World War IV But Wouldn t that mean the end of the Fraternities 
it did  Lancedale says  if we re so incompetent that we have to keep the rest of the world in ignorance to earn a living  the world s better off without us  He says that every oligarchy carries in it the seeds of its own destruction; that if we can t evolve with the rest of the world  we re doomed in any case  That s why we want to elect your father  If he can get his socialized Literacy program adopted  we ll be in a position to load the public with so many controls and restrictions and formalities that even the most bigoted Illiterate will want to learn to read  Lancedale says  a private monopoly like ours is bad  but a government monopoly is intolerable  and the only way the public can get rid of it would be by becoming Literates  themselves Poor Senator!
children are Literates  and his program against Literacy is being twisted against itself!But you agree that we re right and he s wrong 
must  or you d never have come to me to learn to read He s such a good father  I d hate to see him hurt 
Ralph  you re my man  Anything you re for  I m for  and anything you re against  I m against Claire  now that everybody knows--
 Top emergency! Top emergency! 
disorder in Department Thirty-two! You have wall screens 
school China
What s Joyner-Graves trying to do to us  Frank 
It s what we re going to do to them 
chief tell you Chasing all over town about that tip from Sforza  Nothing  of course  Nothing from Sforza  either  The thing must have been planned weeks ago  whatever it is  and everybody briefed personally  and nothing on disk or tape about it  But what s going to happen here  Lancedale going to pull a rabbit out of his hat full-grown Bengal tiger! I hope it doesn t eat us  by mistake I have every confidence in the chief 
tigers make a meal off anybody  it ll be--Literate President 
most serious problem  which I and some of my colleagues have brought to the attention of this Council many times in the past--the problem of Black Literacy!anything could destroy our Fraternities  to which we have given our lives  devotion  it would be the widespread tendency to by-pass the Fraternities  the practice of Literacy by non-Fraternities people--We ve heard all that before  Wilton!
gotten on every record of every meeting for the last thirty years Why  this Pelton business 
what I mean  Your own associates are responsible for it!And that s not all  brother Literates 
Pelton has been openly doing the work of a Literate; going over the store s written records  checking inventories  checking the credit guide  handling the price lists--What s that got to do with Black Literacy 
practice of Literacy  for hire  by a non-Fraternity Literate  or Literate service furnished for criminal or politically subversive purposes  or the betrayal of a client by a Fraternity Literate  There s nothing of the sort involved here  This girl  who does appear to be Literate  is simply looking after the interests of her family s business the very least  irregular circumstances  and without payment of any fee  Any fee  that is  that the Fraternities can collect any percentage on  And the Literate who taught her also taught her younger brother  Ray Pelton  and this Literate  who is known to be her lover--Suppose he is her lover  so what 
remove any objection  Why  if she were to come forward and admit and demonstrate her Literacy  there d be no possible objection from the Fraternities  viewpoint to her marrying young Prestonby brother commendation of the Fraternities  He s put a period to four generations of bigoted Illiterates motion Literates: I yield to no man in my abhorrence of Black Literacy  or in my detestation for the political principles of which Chester Pelton has made himself the spokesman  but I deny that we should allow the acts and opinions of the Illiterate parent to sway us in our consideration of the Literate children  It has come to my notice  as it has to Literate Graves   that this young woman  Claire Pelton  is Literate to a degree that would be a credit to any Literate First Class  and her brother can match his Literacy creditably against that of any novice in our Fraternities  To show that we respect Literate ability  wherever we find it; to show that we are not the monopolistic closed-corporation our enemies accuse us of being; to show that we are not animated by a vindictive hatred of anything bearing the name of Pelton--I move  and ask that my motion be presented for seconding  that Claire Pelton  and her brother  Raymond Pelton  be duly elected  respectively  to the positions of Literate Third Class and Literate Novice  as members of the Associated Fraternities of Literates!Admit the young Peltons!Literate President!
Chester Pelton s violent denunciation of our Fraternities--Literate Lancedale 
debated until it has been properly seconded What does the Literate President think I m doing 
I second the motion!
Furthermore 
Joyner s motion  I move that the ceremony of the administration of the Literates  Oath  and the investiture in the smock and insignia  be carried out as soon as possible  and that an audio-visual recording be made  and telecast this evening  before twenty-one hundred Excellent!
Literate Joyner Literate President  brother Literates 
for an immediate vote on this amended motion  which I  personally  endorse most heartily  and which I hope to see carried unanimously Now  wait a minute!
debated--What do you want to debate about it 
presented it  didn t you typical of our problems in dealing with Black     I mean  non-Fraternities     Literacy--You mean  you didn t know it was loaded!
that s your hard luck; we re going to squeeze the trigger!I withdraw the motion!
Literate President 
his motion  now  It has been properly seconded and placed before the house  and so has my own humble contribution to it  I demand that the motion be acted upon Vote! Vote! Vote!
I call on all my adherents to vote against this motion!
Now look here  Wilton!
place! Do you want to smash everything we ve ever done in the Fraternities Harvey  we can t go on with it 
For the record 
Joyner  has just whispered to Literate Graves that since I have seconded his motion  he s now afraid of it  I think Literate Graves is trying to assure him that my support is merely a bluff  For the information of this body  I want to state categorically that it is not  and that I will be deeply disappointed if this motion does not pass I was against this fool idea from the start!
to keep the Illiterates down; how are we ever going to do that if we go making Literates out of them  But you two thought you were being smart--Shut up and sit down  you old jackass!
Shut up  yourself  Ginter 
Order!
This is disgraceful!
You can say that again!
you people over on the right think this is; an Illiterates  Organization Political Action meeting Vote! Vote!
presented and seconded  It will now be put to a vote!Roll call!
The vote will be by roll call 
Addison  Walter G 
Aye!
Agostino  Pedro V 
Aye!
against is herewith declared carried  Literate Lancedale  I appoint you to organize a committee to implement the said motion  at once Sergeant! Who s in charge of store police  now 
I guess I am 
Freizer s in the hospital; he was taken sick suddenly last evening the TV  We have troubles Wait a moment  sergeant 
your reserves down there  We re going to need them to hold the executive country  up here  This is only the start of a general riot Who are you and what do you know about it 
Listen to him  Guido 
He knows what he s doing 
customers in and out of the store  haven t you Why  yes; here 
jibe number of customers  even allowing for shopping habits of a bargain-day crowd  But what s that got to do--Look at those groups of men  three or four to a group  shifting around  waiting for something to happen  This store s been infiltrated by a big goon gang  That business in Chinaware s just the start  to draw our reserves down to the third floor  Look at that  now See how they re concentrating  there 
ladies  wear department  there are three men for every woman  and the men are all drifting from counter to counter over in the direction of our escalators Literate  you know your stuff!
really going to hit  What do you think it is  Macy & Gimbel s trying to bust up our sale  or politics where your biggest volume of sale was going on  though; political enemies would try to get up here  and that s what this gang s trying to do He s absolutely right  Guido 
he tells you need them up here  Where are they  now  and how many Thirteen  counting myself and the man in there 
the floor below And for the mob below to get up here 
country  And we got some new counters that Mr  Latterman had built  that didn t get put out in time for the sale  We can use them to build barricades  if we have to How about a  copter attack on the roof 
plenty of A-A equipment up there--four 7-mm machine guns  two 12-mm s  and one 20-mm auto-cannon  We could hold off the State Guard with that the escalators  Think  now  sergeant  Fires  burglary  holdups--of each escalator  and a couple more that can be dragged over from other outlets  Say we put two men on each hose  lying down at the head of the escalators  And we got plenty of firearms; we can arm some of these clerks  up here--inter-department telephone  not by public address  to floorwalkers from the fifth floor down  to gather up all male clerks and other store personnel in their departments  arm them with anything they can find  and rush them to Chinaware  Tell them to shout  Pelton!  when they hit the mob  to avoid breaking each others  heads in the confusion  and tell them they re expected to hold the Chinaware and Glassware departments themselves  without any help from the store police Why not 
That s how battles come to happen at the wrong time and place 
back for re-enforcements  and the next thing anybody knows  there s a full-size battle going on where nobody wants to fight one  We re going to fight our main battle at the head of the escalators from the twelfth floor You ve done this sort of work before  Literate 
You talk like a storm-troop captain  What else 
offensive  ourselves from this block to the basement Yeah  Wait till I see 
Yeah  and the elevator s up here  too 
couple of the office crew--arm them with pistols  carbines  clubs  whatever you please  and take them down to the basement  Gather up all the warehouse gang  down there  and arm them  And as soon as you get to the basement  send the elevator back up here  That s our life line; we can t risk having it captured  You ll organize flying squads to go up into the store from the basement  Bust up any trouble that seems to be getting started  if you can  but your main mission will be to rescue store police  Literates  Literates  guards  and store help  and get them back to the basement  They ll be picked up from there and brought up here on the elevator Literate Hopkinson to countersign it for you  when you find him  Tell him we want his whole gang up here as soon as possible How about getting help from outside 
or--City police won t lift a finger 
help anybody who has a private police force; they have too much to do protecting John Q  Citizen  Hutschnecker; suppose you call Radical-Socialist campaign headquarters; tell them to rush some of their Lone Rangers around here--Mr  Latterman! Mr  Latterman!
fight  down in Chinaware--!Well  what do we have store police for 
care of it  Now be quiet  Madge; don t get the customers excited!sixth and up! fight     smashing everything up--Gimme a bottle of Atom-Bomb 
Don t bother wrapping it 
Yes  sir 
That ll be two C  sir 
I see you re wearing a Radical-Socialist button 
Because you want to  or because Chet Pelton makes you 
convictions That s all that rotgut s good for 
All right  boys; help yourselves!
I ought to have anticipated that 
the liquor stores are the first things looted  The liquor stores  and the--Claire! See what s going on in Sporting Goods!Macy & Gimbel s 
trouble--probably one of their price-spotters phoned in about it--and they re offering to send twenty of their store-cops to help us out  They ll be landing on our stage in eight minutes  rifles and steel helmets That you  Prestonby 
Didn t know you were at Pelton s  What s going on  there 
Yes; we had some of our people at the store  in plain clothes 
reported a riot starting  but naturally  their reports were incomplete  Can you get one of your landing stages cleared for us  We have two hundred men  in twenty  copters protect our own people at the store Yes  of course 
You ll probably find a fight going on on our twelfth floor  just inside  Anybody who s trying to get up the escalators to the office block will be an enemy Right  We re halfway there now 
You heard that 
we can hold out till they get here  we re all right  Did you contact Radical-Socialist headquarters  yet  Hutschnecker storm troops had been lured out to some kind of a disturbance in North Jersey Borough; he d try to get them recalled the Literates  Guards and Macy & Gimbel s will have pulled Pelton s bacon off the fire for him  Nice friends he has!Here come the goons! South escalator!

Broadway Wife 
steadily worse  We take you now to downtown Manhattan  where our portable units and commentators have just arrived  and switch you to Ed Morgan give you the picture  We re having what is usually labeled as  slight technical difficulties   in this case the difficulty of avoiding having a hole shot in our camera or in your commentator s head  Yes  that s shooting you hear; there  somebody s using an auto rifle! How are you coming  Steve what s sure to go down in history as the Battle of Pelton s Purchasers  Paradise--Huh 
brawl  and spread to the Liquor Department  and then  all of a sudden  everybody started playing rough  At first  it was suspected that Macy & Gimbel s had sent a goon gang around to break up Pelton s fall sale  but when the former concern rallied to the assistance of their competitor with a force of twenty riflemen  that began to look less likely  and we re beginning to think that it might be the work of some of Pelton s political enemies  About ten minutes ago  Major James F  Slater  of the Literates  Guards  arrived with two hundred of his men  to protect the Literates on duty at the store  They captured the entire twelfth floor  where we are  now  with the exception of the Ladies  Lingerie and Hosiery departments around one of the escalators to the lower floors; here the gang who started the riot  and who are now donning white hoods to distinguish themselves from the various other factions involved  have thrown up barricades of counters and display tables and are fighting bitterly to keep control of the escalator head  Ah  here we are!on the east stage  filled with more goons  probably to re-enforce the gang back of that barricade  The firing s gotten noticeably heavier--What s the matter  Doug 
going you Doug  didn t Captain Prestonby tell you to stay with me 
Yes--
senator  That s who that goon gang s after No  You gotta stay here  Ray 
The captain--
Why  you dirty rotten Illiterate--!
Come on  Ray; let s go!
Hirschfield; Jerry McCarty; Ramon Nogales; Pete Shawne; Tom Hutchinson--Who-- 
What ve they gotta do with-- 
at a Dutch picnic them called for and sent in here can find us some transport  I think there ought to be a couple of big  copters finished down at the shops  And if you can find a couple more Literates  guards you can talk into going with us--That thing been tested  yet 
back with a load of supplies preferably--bring it around behind the Administration Wing  Captain Prestonby wants it  I m to take some boys from Fourth Year Civics on a tour  Something about election campaign methods All right; you guys start earning your pay 
a party Mason 
you can all get in it  I m taking off in a four-ton truck  with some of these kids  I want you boys to follow us  We re going to Pelton s store  There s a fight going on there  and the captain s in the middle of it  We gotta get him out thing off and listen to me!This is absolutely outrageous!
murderous battle like that--Well  maybe it ain t right  using savages in a civilized riot 
use live devils  if I could catch a few Here; you kids don t want this kinda stuff 
killing tools!It s what we ll have to use  Doug 
happening  since you went out  Look at the screen when there s no clip in  or when the clip s empty  When you got a loaded clip in  you just pull back on this and let go--Literates see  by now  that the policy of unyielding opposition which some of you have advocated and pursued is futile  You know the policy I favor  which now remains the only policy we can follow; it is summed up in that law of political strategy: If you can t lick  em  join  em  and  after joining  take control   that  if we do not destroy ourselves by our own folly in the meantime  we should  two years thereafter  be in complete if secret control of the whole Consolidated States Government  If any of you question that last statement  you can merely ask yourselves one question: How  in the name of all that is rational  can Illiterates control and operate a system of socialized Literacy  Who but Literates can keep such a program from disintegrating into complete and indescribable confusion   looked around the room   Instantly  Cardon was on his feet with a motion to recess the meeting until 1300 the following Monday  and Brigade commander Chernov seconded the motion immediately  As soon as Literate President Morehead s gavel banged  Cardon  still on his feet  was running for the double doors at the rear; the two Literates  guards on duty there got them unsealed and opened by the time he had reached them   There was another guard in the hall  waiting for him with a little record-disk    Cardon snapped the disk into his recorder-reproducer and put in the ear plug    Slater s voice came out of the small machine  
 Cardon pulled out the ear plug  stuffed the recorder into his trouser pocket  and began unbuckling his Sam Browne as he ran for the nearest wall visiphone  He was dialing the guard room on that floor with one hand as he took off the belt    he ordered  unbuttoning his smock  
at the guard  the last word back over his shoulder as he ran for the escalator   [Illustration:]  It was three eternal minutes after he had reached the landing stage above before the ambulance arrived  medic and orderly on the front seat and the four guards  all in conservatively cut civilian clothes  inside  He crowded in beside the medic  told him  and snapped the door shut as the big white  copter began to rise   They climbed to five thousand feet  and then the driver nosed his vehicle up  cut his propeller and retracted it  and fired his rocket  aiming toward downtown Manhattan  Four minutes later  after the rocket stopped firing and they were on the down-curve of their trajectory  the propeller was erected and they began letting down toward the central landing stage of Pelton s Purchasers  Paradise  Cardon cut in the TV and began calling the control tower    he called  
 One of Pelton s traffic-control men appeared on Cardon s screen   he said  
 The ambulance came slanting in from uptown  and Cardon looked around anxiously  The May-fly dance of customers   copters had stopped; there was a Sabbath stillness about the big store  at least visually  A few small figures in Literates  guards black leather moved about on the north landing stage  and several Pelton employees were on the central stop stage  The howling of the  copter propeller overhead effectively blocked out any sounds that might be coming from the building  at least until the ambulance landed  Then a spatter of firing from below was audible   Cardon  the medic and the guards piled out  the latter with the stretcher  The orderly-driver got out his tablet pistol and checked the chamber  then settled into a posture of watchful relaxation  Major Slater was waiting for them by one of the vertical lift platforms    Cardon hushed him quickly  warned    Slater said  
 That was good  Ralph would help get Claire to Literates  Hall  after they d gotten her father to safety    Slater was saying  
  Cardon said  
where they found Claire Pelton and Ralph Prestonby waiting    Prestonby said  
    Cardon commented gently  
Horace Yingling and Joe West; this time tomorrow  they ll be a pair of dead traitors  he thought   Prestonby gave a sidewise glance toward Claire and shook his head  his lips pressed tightly together   She doesn t know  yet   Cardon interpreted    Prestonby said  aloud  
 Cardon nodded  Probably vindictive about being involved in action injurious to Pelton s commercial interests; just another odd quirk of Literate ethics    he said  
to the medic and the four plain-clothes guards     The medic and the guards moved into Chester Pelton s private rest room with the stretcher  Claire went to the desk and began picking up odds and ends  including the pistol Cardon had given her  and putting them in her handbag   he told Prestonby softly   Prestonby grabbed his hand impulsively   There was a sudden blast of sound from overhead--the banging of machine guns  the bark of the store s 20-mm auto-cannon  the howling of airplane jets  and the crash of explosions  Everybody in the room jerked up and stood frozen  then Prestonby jumped for the TV-screen and pawed at the dials  A moment later  after the screen flashed and went black twice  they were looking across the topside landing stage from a pickup at one corner   A slim fighter-bomber  with square-tipped  backswept  wings  was jetting up in almost perpendicular flight; another was coming in toward the landing stage  and  as they watched  a flight of rockets leaped forward from under its wings  Cardon saw the orderly-driver of the ambulance jump down and start to run for the open lift-shaft  He got five steps away from his vehicle  Then the rockets came in  and one of them struck the tarpaulin-covered pile of boxes beside the ambulance  There was a flash of multicolored flame  in which the man and the vehicle he had left both vanished  Immediately  the screen went black   The fireworks had mostly exploded at the first blast; however  when Cardon and Major Slater and one or two others reached the top landing stage  there were still explosions  A thing the size and shape of a two-gallon kettle  covered with red paper  came rolling toward them  and suddenly let go with a blue-green flash  throwing a column of smoke  in miniature imitation of an A-bomb  into the air  Something about three feet long came whizzing at them on the end of a tail of fire  causing them to fling themselves flat; involuntarily  Cardon s head jerked about and his eyes followed it until it blew up with a flash and a bang three blocks uptown  Here and there  colored fire flared  small rockets flew about  and firecrackers popped   The ambulance was gone  blown clear off the roof  The other  copters on the landing stage were a tangled mass of wreckage  The 20-mm was toppled over; the gunner was dead  and one of the crew  half-dazed  was trying to drag a third man from under the overturned gun  The control tower  with the two 12-mm machine guns  was wrecked  The two 7-mm s that had been left on the top had vanished  along with the machine gunners  in a hole that had been blown in the landing stage   Cardon  Slater  and the others dashed forward and pulled the auto-cannon off the injured man  hauling him and his companion over to the lift  The two rakish-winged fighter-bombers were returning  spraying the roof with machine-gun bullets  and behind them came a procession of fifteen big  copters  They dropped the lift hastily; Slater jumped off when it was still six feet above the floor  and began shouting orders    Cardon caught up a rifle and rummaged for a bandolier of ammunition  losing about a minute in the search  The delay was fortunate; when he got to the escalators  he was met by a rush of men hurrying down the ascending spiral or jumping over onto the descending one    one of them was shouting  
 He turned and looked toward the freight lift  It was coming down again  with Falk and his men unconscious on it  knocked senseless by bludgeons of inaudible sound  and a half a dozen of the  copter-borne raiders  all wearing the white robes and hoods of the Independent-Conservative storm troops  He swung his rifle up and began squeezing the trigger  remembering to first make sure that the fire-control lever was set forward for semiauto  and remembering his advice to Goodkin  that morning  By the time the platform had stopped  all the men in white robes were either dead or wounded  and none of the unconscious Literates  guards along with them had been injured  The medic who had come with Cardon  assisted by a couple of the office force  got the casualties sorted out  There was nothing that could be done about the men who had been sono-stunned; in half an hour or so  they would recover consciousness with no ill effects that a couple of headache tablets wouldn t set right   The situation  while bad  was not immediately desperate  If the white-clad raiders controlled the top landing stage  they were pinned down by the firearms and sono guns of the defenders  below  who were in a position to stop anything that came down the escalators or the lift shaft  The fate of the first party was proof of that  And the very magnitude of the riot guaranteed that somebody on the outside  city police  State guards  or even Consolidated States regulars  would be taking a hand shortly  The air attack and  copter-landing on the roof had been excellent tactics  but it had been a serious policy-blunder  As long as the disturbance had been confined to the interior of the store  the city police could shrug it off as another minor riot on property supposed to be protected by private police  and do nothing about it  The rocket-attack on the top landing stage and the spectacular explosion of the fireworks temporarily stored there  however  was something that simply couldn t be concealed or dismissed  The cloud of varicolored smoke alone must have been visible all over the five original boroughs of the older New York  and there were probably rumors of atom-bombing going around   thing  said to Cardon    Cardon told him  
 He snapped his fingers suddenly  
 There were two dead men in white Independent-Conservative robes and hoods  lying where they had been dragged from the lift platform  Cardon pulled off the hoods and zipped open the white robes  One of the men was a complete stranger; the other  however  was a man he had seen  earlier in the day  at the Manhattan headquarters of the Radical-Socialist Party  One of the Consolidated Illiterates  Organization people; a follower of West and Yingling    he said  straightening  
        *       *       *       *       *  Ray Pelton and Doug Yetsko had their heads out an open window on the right side of the cab of the  copter truck; Ray was pointing down    he said  
 Yetsko nodded  There d be a watchman  or a private cop  in the building on which Ray intended landing  A couple of hundred dollars would take care of him  and they could leave two of Mason s boys with the vehicles to see that he stayed bribed    he asked  
 nodded toward the body of the truck  behind  where his dozen-odd  teenage recruits were riding    Yetsko said  
 That  Ray knew  was about as high praise as Doug Yetsko could give anybody  He d have liked to ask Doug more about Captain Prestonby--Doug could never seem to get used to the idea of his officer being a schoolteacher--but there was no time  The  copter truck was already settling onto the roof   The watchman proved amenable to reason  He took one look at Yetsko  with three feet of weighted fire hose in his hand  and gulped  then accepted the two C-notes Yetsko gave him  They left a couple of Literates  guards with the vehicles  and Ray led the way to the fire escape  and down into the alley  A few hundred feet away  there was an iron grating which they pulled up  Ray drew the pistol he had gotten out of Captain Prestonby s arms locker and checked the magazine  chamber  and safety  knowing that Yetsko and the other guards were watching him critically  and then started climbing down the ladder   The conduit was halfway down  Yetsko  climbing behind him  examined it with his flashlight  probably wondering how he was going to fit himself into a hole like that  They climbed down onto the concrete walkway beside the conveyor belts  and in the dim light of the overhead lamps Ray could see that the two broad belts  to and from the store  were empty for as far as he could see in either direction  Normally  there should be things moving constantly in both directions--big wire baskets full of parcels for delivery  and trash containers  going out  and bales and crates and cases of merchandise  and empty delivery baskets and trash containers coming in  He pointed this out to Yetsko    the big Literates  guards sergeant nodded  
  Ray told him  
 Yetsko shook his head    Ray said  
  Yetsko told the guards corporal  
 Ray and Yetsko and Ramon Nogales started forward  Halfway to the next conduit port  there was a smear of lubricating oil on the concrete  and in it  and away from it in the direction of the store  they found footprints  It was Ramon Nogales who noticed the oil on the ladder to the next conduit port    Yetsko told him  
 At the port beyond  they halted  waiting for Mason s man to come up  They lost some time  thereafter  but they learned that the section of conduit between the two ports was empty and that the main telephone line to the store had been cut  Whoever had cut it had gone  either forward or back away from the store  A little farther on  the sound of shots ahead became audible over the clanking and rattling of the conveyor belts    Yetsko said  
 One of the boys scouted ahead  and returned to report that they could reach the next conduit port  but that the section of both conveyor belts ahead of him was stopped  apparently wedged   Yetsko stood for a moment  grimacing in an effort to reach a decision    he said  
  Ray said  
 Before Yetsko could object  he started up the ladder  Yetsko behind him and the others following  At the next conduit port  they could hear shooting very plainly  seeming to be in front of them  At the next one  the shooting seemed to be going on directly under them  in the tunnel  With the flashlight Yetsko had passed forward to him  Ray could see that the dust on the concrete floor of the three-foot by three-foot passage between and under the power and telephone cables was undisturbed   A little farther on  there was an opening on the left  and a power cable branched off downward  at a sharp angle  overhead  Ray was able to turn about and get his feet in front of him; Yetsko had to crawl on until he had passed it  and then back into it after Ray had entered  Bracing one foot on either side  Ray inched his way down the forty-degree slope  hoping that the two hundred pound weight of Doug Yetsko wouldn t start sliding upon him   Ahead  he could hear voices  He drew his hands and feet away from the sides of the branch conduit and let himself slip  landing in a heap in the electricians  shop  above the furnace rooms  Two men  who had been working at a bench  trying to assemble a mass of equipment into a radio  whirled  snatching weapons  Ray knew both of them--Sam Jacobowitz and George Nyman  who serviced the store s communications equipment  They both stared at him  swearing in amazement    Ray called out  
        *       *       *       *       *  Frank Cardon and Ralph Prestonby were waiting at the freight-elevator door when it opened and Russell Latterman emerged  a rifle slung over one shoulder  Cardon stepped forward and took the rifle from him    he said  
 They led him to one side  Latterman looked from one to the other apprehensively  licking his lips   him    Prestonby wanted to know  
  Latterman said  
  Cardon nodded  
the rifle back to Latterman    Latterman said  
 him  Latterman about the rocket attack on the control tower  which also housed the store s telecast station   said    Prestonby said  
 They went into Pelton s office  The store owner was still lying motionless on his stretcher  Claire was fiddling with a telecast receiving set; she had just tuned out a lecture on Home Beautifications and had gotten the mid-section of a serial in which three couples were somewhat confused over just who was married to whom   the knob again  Then she froze  as Elliot C  Mongery--this time sponsored by Parc  the Miracle Cleanser--appeared on the screen    Prestonby looked worried  he said   [Illustration:]   Cardon suggested  
himself just in time to avoid mentioning the platoon of Literates  guards at the Pelton home  which he was not supposed to know about   said    Mongery continued  
  Latterman said  coming up at the moment  
 Prestonby asked    Latterman said  
         *       *       *       *       *  There was a series of heavy explosions on the floor above  Everybody grabbed weapons and hurried outside  crowding onto the escalators  The floor above was a shambles  with bodies lying about  and the descending escalator was packed with white-robed attackers  who had apparently prepared for their charge by tossing down a number of heavy fragmentation bombs  Cardon had a burp gun  this time; he emptied the fifty-shot magazine into the hooded hoodlums who were coming down  Prestonby  beside him  had a heavy sono gun; he kept it trained on the head of the escalator and held the trigger back until it was empty  then slapped in a fresh clip of the small blank cartridges which produced the sound waves that were amplified and altered to stunning vibrations  Still  many of the attackers got through  More were dropping down the lift-platform shaft  Cardon s submachine-gun ceased firing  the action open on an empty clip  He dropped it and yanked the heavy pistol from his shoulder holster  Then  from the direction of the freight elevator  reinforcements arrived  headed by a huge man in the black leather of the Literates  guard  who swung a three-foot length of fire hose with his right hand and fired a pistol with his left  and a boy in a black-and-red jacket who was letting off a burp gun in deliberate  parsimonious  bursts  It was a second or two before Cardon recognized them as Prestonby s bodyguard  Doug Yetsko  and Claire Pelton s brother Ray  There were four Literates  guards and about a dozen boys with them  all firing with a variety of weapons   At the same time  others were arriving on the escalators from the floors below  firing as they came off--Slater s Literates  guards  the Literates and their black-jacketed troopers of Hopkinson s store service crew  the fifteen survivors of the twenty riflemen from Macy & Gimbel s  The attackers turned and crowded onto the ascending escalator  Most of them got away  the casualties being carried up by the escalator  Doug Yetsko bounded forward and brought his fire hose down on the back of one invader s neck  Then  after a last spatter of upward-aimed shots from the defenders  there was silence   Cardon stepped forward and yanked the hood from the man whom Yetsko had knocked down  hoping that he had a stunned prisoner who could be interrogated  The man was dead  however  with a broken neck  For a moment  Cardon looked down at the heavy  brutal features of Joe West  the Illiterates  Organization man  If Chester Pelton got out of this mess alive and won the election tomorrow  there was going to have to be a purge in the Radical-Socialist party  and something was going to have to be done about the Consolidated Organization of Illiterates  He turned to Yetsko    he said  
    Yetsko grinned  
 Cardon looked around quickly  in search of Ray  The boy  having come out of the excitement of battle  was looking around at the litter of dead and wounded on the blood-splashed floor  His eyes widened  and he gulped  Then  carefully setting the safety of his burp gun and slinging it  he went over and leaned against the wall  and was sick   Prestonby  with Claire Pelton beside him  started toward the white-faced  retching boy  Yetsko put out a hamlike hand to stop them    he said  
 maternal protectiveness    Yetsko told her  
 he declared  
 Claire looked up at Prestonby almost worshipfully    Cardon stepped over the body of Joe West and went up to them    he said  
asked Yetsko   Yetsko frowned     Yetsko said  
 joining them    Cardon decided  
 he told Claire  
  Claire started to object  
  Cardon said  
 He grinned suddenly  
        *       *       *       *       *  The trip out through the conduit was not so difficult  even with the encumbrance of the unconscious Chester Pelton  but Prestonby was convinced that  except for the giant strength of Doug Yetsko  it would have been nearly impossible  Ray Pelton  recovered from his after-battle nausea and steeled by responsibility  went first  Cardon crawled after him  followed by a couple of the boys  Then came Yetsko  dragging the sleeping bag in which Chester Pelton was packed like a mummy  Prestonby himself followed  pushing on his future father-in-law s feet  and Claire crawled behind  with the rest of Ray s schoolmates for a rearguard   They got past the battle which was still going on at the entrance to the store basement  letting Pelton down with a rope and carrying him onto the outward-bound belt  They left it in time to assemble under the ladder leading to the alley through which Ray said they had entered  and hauled Pelton up after them  Then  when they were all out in the open again  Ray ran up the alley and mounted a fire escape  and  in a few minutes  a big  copter truck which had been parked on the roof let down to them  Into this  Cardon ordered the unconscious senatorial candidate loaded  and the boys who had come with Ray   Prestonby  which was hovering above  waiting for the truck to leave  scribbled an address and a phone number and a couple of names   Prestonby nodded and watched Cardon climb into the truck  The Literates  guard who was driving lifted it up and began windmilling away toward the east  The passenger  copter  driven by another guard from the school  settled down  Putting Ray and Claire into it  he climbed in after them    he said  
 Ray s eyes opened    Claire looked at him inquiringly  saying nothing    he said  
  Prestonby shrugged          *       *       *       *       *  Russell Latterman noticed that Major Slater was looking at him in a respectfully inquiring manner  He said nothing  and  at length  the Literates  guards officer broke the silence    Latterman shook his head     Slater thrust out his hand impulsively   he said  
    He looked around him  
        *       *       *       *       *  Cardon watched Chester Pelton apprehensively as the bald-headed merchant and senatorial candidate sipped from the tall glass in his hand and then set it on the table beside him  His face was pale  and he had the look of a man who has just been hit with a blackjack     Pelton swore vilely  in a lifeless monotone  cursing Literacy  and all Literates back to the invention of the alphabet  Then he stopped short      Cardon shook his head    Pelton gloomed  
to have reached a point at which he was actually getting a masochistic pleasure out of turning the dagger in his wounds      Cardon told him  impatiently  
 Pelton took another gulp from the tall glass at his elbow  emptying it   he said  
 Then his face clouded again  
 Cardon drew a little half-inch record-disk from his pocket case    he said  
 Pelton snapped the disk onto his recorder and put in the ear plug  Then  before he pressed the stud  he looked at Cardon curiously      interruption  one of Literate Frank Cardon s best friends; he comforted his conscience with the knowledge that Mongery would slander him just as unscrupulously  if the interests of the Lancedale Plan were at stake  gesture  as though he were picking up some small animal by the scruff of the neck   While Pelton listened to the record  Cardon mixed him another of the highballs  adding a little of the heart-stimulant the medic had given him  Pelton was grinning savagely when he turned off the little machine and took out the ear plug    He thought for a moment  
   Cardon shook his head          *       *       *       *       *  Literate William R  Lancedale looked up from his desk and greeted his visitor with a smile    Cardon nodded  dropping into a chair beside the desk    Lancedale chuckled  
 Cardon shuddered and grimaced horribly   Lancedale grinned at him   Cardon said   passed him the cigar humidor   Cardon  having picked up the Italian stiletto to puncture his cigar  looked at it carefully to make sure that it really had no edge  and then drew it quickly across his throat     Illiterates  Organization Action Committee people named Joe West and Horace Yingling  both deceased  That was the result of Latterman s bright idea to trap Claire and/or me into betraying Literacy  These Illiterate fanatics made up their minds  to speak rather loosely  that the whole Pelton family were Literates  including Chet himself  They decided that it was better to kill off their candidate and use him for a martyr two years from now than to elect him and have him sell them out  They got about a hundred or so of their goons dressed in Independent-Conservative KKK costumes  bought air support from Patsy Callazo s mob  up in Vermont  and made that attack on the top landing stage  after starting a fake riot in North Jersey  to draw off the regular Radical-Socialist storm troops  Incidentally  when I found out it was Callazo s gang that furnished those fighter bombers  I hired another mob to go up and drop a block-buster on Callazo s field  to teach him to keep his schnozzle out of politics Yingling Yingling  myself  after I d gotten reinforcements to the store--first a couple of free-lance storm troops that the insurance company hired  and then as many of the Radical Rangers as I could gather up And Pelton knows about all this 
through  as far as any consideration or patronage from the Radicals is concerned business to pull the Independent-Conservative party together again  to cash in on public dissatisfaction with Pelton s socialized Literacy program  which ought to be coming apart at the seams by then  And if we have the Illiterates split into two hostile factions--along  O Reilly can only cover me for a short while  and I have to be getting to this victory party of Pelton s--times  what a fine job you did  Frank knowing you  I m positive     that you ll be able to engineer a reconciliation between Pelton and his son and daughter and young Prestonby  And then  have yourself a good vacation along the old Pennsylvania-New York state line  A little community of about a thousand people  where everybody  men  women and children  can read A community of Literates 
can read and write place  and I imagine  a couple of hundred years ago  the community was too poor to support one of these  progressive  school systems that made Illiterates out of the people in the cities  Probably couldn t raise enough money in school taxes to buy all the expensive audio-visual equipment  so they had to use old-fashioned textbooks  and teach the children to read from them  They have radios  and TV  of course  but they also have a little daily paper  and they have a community library be quite a few little enclaves of lower-case-literacy like that  in back-woods and mountain communities  especially in the west and the south  I m going to make a project of finding such communities  helping them  and getting recruits from them  They ll fit into the Plan  Well  I ll be seeing you some time tomorrow  I suppose

He hates our Team 
of civilians  who aren t subject to his regulations and don t have to salute him  We re working under contract with the Western Union  not with the United States Government  and as the United States participates in the Western Union on a treaty basis  our contract has the force of a treaty obligation  It gives us what amounts to extraterritoriality  like Europeans in China during the Nineteenth Century  So we have our own transport  for which he must furnish petrol  and our own armed guard  and we fly our own flag over Team Center  and that gripes him as much as anything else  That and the fact that we re foreigners  So wouldn t he love to make this espionage rap stick on us!action against us in case we endanger the national security could get shot over this  if we re not careful  Dunc  does it really have to be one of our own people who-- I don t see how it could be anybody else 
the idea any more than you do  but there it is Well  what are we going to do  Is there nobody whom we can trust 
who are absolutely loyal  But among the Team itself--the top researchers--there s nobody I d take a chance on but Kato Sugihara but--I have a couple of reasons for eliminating Kato 
first place  outside nucleonic and binding-force physics  there are only three things he s interested in  Jitterbugging  hand-painted neckties  and Southern-style cooking  If he went over to the Komintern  he wouldn t be able to get any of those  Then  he only spends about half his share of the Team s profits  and turns the rest back into the Team Fund  He has a credit of about a hundred thousand dollars  which he d lose by leaving us  And then  there s another thing  Kato s father was killed on Guadalcanal  in 1942  when he was only five  After that he was brought up in the teachings of Bushido by his grandfather  an old-time samurai  Bushido is open to some criticism  but nobody can show where double-crossing your own gang is good Bushido  And today  Japan is allied with the Western Union  and in any case  he wouldn t help the Komintern  The Japs ll forgive Russia for that Mussolini back-stab in 1945 after the Irish start building monuments to Cromwell driving dread the thought of sitting at the table with the others  and wondering which of them is betraying us Only nine of us  instead of thirteen  and still one is a Judas

  Kato grinned  like a tomcat contemplating the bones of a fish he has just eaten    He turned to MacLeod  
 MacLeod nodded  He handloaded for his  38-special  and like all advanced cases of handloading-fever  he was religiously fanatical about uniformity of bullet weights and dimensions  Unlike most handloaders  he had available the instruments to secure such uniformity    Kato said  
  MacLeod said  He glanced around the table  
  Kato said  
    MacLeod rose silently and tiptoed around behind his wife and Rudolf von Heldenfeld  to touch Kato Sugihara on the shoulder    he whispered  
        *       *       *       *       *  The Japanese nodded and rose  following him outside onto the roof above the laboratories  They walked over to the edge and stopped at the balustrade    Kato s almond-shaped eyes widened    The Japanese sucked in his breath in a sharp hiss     Kato said  
  MacLeod replied  
    told him   He paused  
 Kato responded to this with a gruesome double-take that gave his face the fleeting appearance of an ancient samurai war mask    he said  
at MacLeod pleadingly     Kato began  
  MacLeod added  
  Kato pointed out  
   Kato retorted  
  MacLeod said grimly  
  Kato submitted  
 MacLeod got out his pipe and lit it  For a long time  he stared out across the mountain-ringed vista of sagebrush  dotted at wide intervals with the bulks of research-centers and the red roofs of the villages   said          *       *       *       *       *  The next day started in an atmosphere of suppressed excitement and anxiety  which  beginning with MacLeod and Karen and Kato Sugihara  seemed to communicate itself by contagion to everybody in the MacLeod Team s laboratories  The top researchers and their immediate assistants and students were the first to catch it; they ascribed the tension under which their leader and his wife and the Japanese labored to the recent developments in the collapsed-matter problem  Then  there were about a dozen implicitly-trusted technicians and guards  who had been secretly gathered in MacLeod s office the night before and informed of the crisis that had arisen  Their associates could not miss the fact that they were preoccupied with something unusual   They were a variegated crew; men who had been added to the Team in every corner of the world  There was Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman  the Arab jeep-driver who had joined them in Basra  There was the wiry little Greek whom everybody called Alex Unpronounceable  There was an Italian  and two Chinese  and a cashiered French Air Force officer  and a Malay  and the son of an English earl who insisted that his name was Bertie Wooster  They had sworn themselves to secrecy  had heard MacLeod s story with a polylingual burst of pious or blasphemous exclamations  and then they had scattered  each to the work assigned him   MacLeod had risen early and submitted to the ordeal of the search to leave the reservation and go to town again  this time for a conference at the shabby back-street cigar store that concealed a Counter Espionage center  He had returned just as Farida Khouroglu was finishing the microfilm copies of Kato s ingeniously-concocted pseudo-data  These copies were distributed at noon  while the Team was lunching  along with carbons of the original type-script   He was the first to leave the table  going directly to the basement  where Alex Unpronounceable and the man who had got his alias from the works of P  G  Wodehouse were listening in on the telephone calls going in and out through the Team-center switch-board  and making recordings  For two hours  MacLeod remained with them  He heard Suzanne Maillard and some woman who was talking from a number in the Army married-officers  settlement making arrangements about a party  He heard Rudolf von Heldenfeld make a date with some girl  He listened to a violent altercation between the Team chef and somebody at Army Quartermaster s HQ about the quality of a lot of dressed chicken  He listened to a call that came in for Adam Lowiewski  the mathematician    the caller said  
  Lowiewski s voice replied  
 Bertie Wooster looked up sharply   The telephone beside MacLeod rang  He scooped it up; named himself into it   It was Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman  answered    MacLeod told him  
 MacLeod hung up and straightened  feeling under his packet for his  38-special    he said  
 cylinder  He spoke briefly in description of the Polish mathematician s ancestry  physical characteristics  and probable post-mortem destination  Then he put the gun away  and the three men left the basement          *       *       *       *       *  For minutes that seamed like hours  MacLeod and the Greek waited on the main floor  where they could watch both the elevators and the stairway  Bertie Wooster had gone up to alert Kato Sugihara and Karen  Then the door of one of the elevators opened and Adam Lowiewski emerged  with Kato behind him  apparently lost in a bulky scientific journal he was reading  The Greek moved in from one side  and MacLeod stepped in front of the Pole    he greeted  
 within the bounds of politeness    MacLeod told him  
 There was a split second in which Lowiewski struggled--almost successfully--to erase the consternation from his face   started to slide under his left coat lapel   MacLeod s Colt was covering him before he could complete the movement  At the same time  Kato Sugihara dropped the paper-bound periodical  revealing the thin-bladed knife he had concealed under it  He stepped forward  pressing the point of the weapon against the Pole s side  With the other hand  he reached across Lowiewski s chest and jerked the pistol from his shoulder-holster  It was one of the elegant little  32 Beretta 1954 Model automatics   knife emphasized the order    Lowiewski began  
 Without even replying  MacLeod slammed the doors and started the elevator upward  letting it rise six floors to the living quarters  Karen Hilquist and the aristocratic black-sheep who called himself Bertie Wooster were waiting when he opened the door  The Englishman took one of Lowiewski s arms; MacLeod took the other  The rest fell in behind as they hustled the captive down the hall and into the big sound-proofed dining room  They kept Lowiewski standing  well away from any movable object in the room; Alex Unpronounceable took his left arm as MacLeod released it and went to the communicator and punched the all-outlets button    he called  
        *       *       *       *       *  Karen said something to the Japanese and went outside  For a while  nobody spoke  Kato came over and lit a cigarette in the bowl of MacLeod s pipe  Then the other Team members entered in a body  Evidently Karen had intercepted them in the hallway and warned them that they would find some unusual situation inside; even so  there was a burst of surprised exclamations when they found Adam Lowiewski under detention    MacLeod said  
     Suzanne Maillard said  
    Lowiewski derided  
 went on  He exhibited the Beretta  Englishman          *       *       *       *       *  They did their work thoroughly  A pile of Lowiewski s pocket effects was made on the table; as each item was added to it  the Pole made some sarcastic comment    he jeered  
 suggested   He used the point of his knife to illustrate  The cellophane came unsealed with surprising ease: so did the revenue stamp  He dumped out the contents of the pack: sixteen cigarettes  four cigarette tip-ends  four bits snapped from the other ends--and a small aluminum microfilm capsule   Lowiewski s face twitched  For an instant  he tried vainly to break loose from the men who held him  Then he slumped into a chair  Heym ben-Hillel gasped in shocked surprise  Suzanne Maillard gave a short  felinelike cry  Sir Neville Lawton looked at the capsule curiously and said:  picking it up  She opened it and pulled out a roll of colloidex projection film  There was also a bit of cigarette paper in the capsule  upon which a notation had been made in Kyrilic characters   Rudolf von Heldenfeld could read Russian   The film and the paper passed from hand to hand  The other members of the Team sat down; there was a tendency to move away from the chair occupied by Adam Lowiewski  He noticed this and sneered    he asked  
 Kato Sugihara picked up the capsule  took a final glance at the cigarette pack  and said to MacLeod: Greek          *       *       *       *       *  Heym ben-Hillel turned to the others: his eyes had the hurt and puzzled look of a dog that has been kicked for no reason    MacLeod replied  
He was watching Lowiewski s face keenly   he continued  
  Suzanne Maillard wanted to know  
 MacLeod shook his head   Sir Neville Lawton gave a strangling laugh    MacLeod said  
  Heym ben-Hillel gloomed  
  Suzanne Maillard demanded  
 Israeli pointed out    Sir Neville Lawton agreed  
   Suzanne cried  
  Rudolf von Heldenfeld said  
         *       *       *       *       *  Kato Sugihara  returning alone  looked around the table    Lowiewski told him  
 Kato nodded quickly  He nodded again    Sir Neville objected  
 said     MacLeod shrugged  
  Kato grinned  
   Farida suggested  
  Suzanne protested  
exaggerated shudder     Karen said  
 Heym ben-Hillel looked at MacLeod  his eyes troubled    he asked  
 Von Heldenfeld shouted  banging his fist on the table:         *       *       *       *       *  Lowiewski was smiling  now  The panic that had seized him in the hallway below  and the desperation when the cigarette pack had been opened  had left him   said   Rudolf von Heldenfeld let out an inarticulate roar of fury  For an instant he was beyond words  Then he sprang to his feet    he cried  
MacLeod     Karen Hilquist contradicted  
   Heym ben-Hillel put his elbows on the table and his head in his hands    MacLeod said  rising  
clicked a period to his words   was on his feet  a sudden desperate fear in his face   he shot Adam Lowiewski through the forehead   For an instant  the Pole remained on his feet  Then his knees buckled  and he fell forward against the table  sliding to the floor          *       *       *       *       *  MacLeod went around the table  behind Kato Sugihara and Farida Khouroglu and Heym ben-Hillel  and stood looking down at the man he had killed  He dropped the automatic within a few inches of the dead renegade s outstretched hand  then turned to face the others    Sir Neville Lawton looked critically at the motionless figure on the floor    he said  
  MacLeod s voice was mockingly contrite  
 protested    MacLeod reminded him  
  Suzanne Maillard cried  
 Heym ben-Hillel  who had been staring at MacLeod in shocked unbelief  roused himself    He turned to MacLeod  
  MacLeod said  
nations of the world tolerate the Free Scientists only because they need us  and because they know they can trust us  Now  no responsible government official is going to be deceived for a moment by this suicide story we ve confected  It will be fully understood that Lowiewski was a traitor  and that we found him out and put him to death  And  as a corollary  it will be understood that this Team  as a Team  is fully trustworthy  and that when any individual Team member is found to be untrustworthy  he will be dealt with promptly and without public scandal  In other words  it will be understood  from this time on  that the MacLeod Team is worthy of the status it enjoys and the responsibilities concomitant with it

Ah  Mr  Machiavelli  I presume 
Machiavelli  Junior 
way he signs it Policy Planning as look at you posts in the Galactic Empire Well  I m glad some of you could read it 
few of you understood what it was all about Don t worry  Silk 
it was all about  All too well  you ll find Secretary Ghopal is ready to see Mr  Stephen Silk 
way  please A cigarette 
A glass of rum 
Good morning  Mister Silk 
This way  Mr  Silk  if you please Mr  Silk is  as you know  in our Consular Service 
Halvord s section  He is the gentleman who did such a splendid job for us on Assha--Gamma Norma III    Statesman s Journal  on the Benares-work table    came so incongruously from his bulk    Ghopal said  
  Here it comes   I thought   happily  like a ten-year-old who has just found a new beetle to pull the legs out of   reassure me   was a GO-type  like Sol; that wouldn t be so bad     Oh  God  no!  I thought    Ghopal said  
   I replied  
 Natalenko tittered again   That would be Silas Cumshaw  and this was the first I d heard about it   I asked when it had happened    That was a statement  not a question; Natalenko wasn t trying to insult me  I knew who the z Srauff were; I d run into them  here and there  One of the extra-solar intelligent humanoid races  who seemed to have been evolved from canine or canine-like ancestors  instead of primates  Most of them could speak Basic English  but I never saw one who would admit to understanding more of our language than the 850-word Basic vocabulary  They occupied a half-dozen planets in a small star-cluster about forty light-years beyond the Capella system  They had developed normal-space reaction-drive ships before we came into contact with them  and they had quickly picked up the hyperspace-drive from us back in those days when the Solar League was still playing Missionaries of Progress and trying to run a galaxy-wide Point-Four program   In the past century  it had become almost impossible for anybody to get into their star-group  although z Srauff ships were orbiting in on every planet that the League had settled or controlled  There were z Srauff traders and small merchants all over the galaxy  and you almost never saw one of them without a camera  Their little meteor-mining boats were everywhere  and all of them carried more of the most modern radar and astrogational equipment than a meteor-miner s lifetime earnings would pay for   I also knew that they were one of the chief causes of ulcers and premature gray hair at the League capital on Luna  I d done a little reading on pre-spaceflight Terran history; I had been impressed by the parallel between the present situation and one which had culminated  two and a half centuries before  on the morning of 7 December  1941    Natalenko inquired  
  I replied  
  I nodded again  I said   Natalenko tittered again   Ghopal Singh smiled benignly   he said  
about it to maintain our prestige without alienating the New Texans   New Texas And what

Demoted you from the Consular Service 
Impossible!
Yes  He demoted me to the Cookie Pushers  Clear down to Ambassador 
Gosh  boss  I can t make anything out of this stuff 
Well  then  put it in a player and transcribe it by ear 
secretarial work work Texas  and see you don t get inta no trouble the way around can get inta a lotta trouble on New Texas  If you call gettin  killed trouble popguns museum-pieces you re carrying An  them holsters!
your guns outa them! You better let me find you a real rig  when we get to New Austin    Sure  you State Department guys always know everything 
things is really like on New Texas  an  you let it go in one ear an  out the other Mr  Silk! Mr  Ambassador! Here we are!
the Embassy is right over here!how glad we all are to see you  Mr  Ambassador!have to see  at once We haven t time!
dreadfully late now  sir! You must come with us uproar about whatever it is  You ll see her again Great God!
ever had to suffer from any subordinates in my whole State Department experience! I want an explanation out of you  and it d better be a good one!hadn t gotten you away from the spaceport and to the Embassy at once  we would all have been much sorrier Somebody here gunnin  for the Ambassador 
Oh  no! I hadn t even thought of that 
You have no idea of the state into which things have gotten     Oh  pardon me  Mr  Ambassador  I am Gilbert W  Thrombley  your chargé d affaires Secretary of the Embassy We got a tail  boss! Two of them! Look back there!
What the devil s the matter  Thrombley 
Mr  Silk 
Stonehenge; Space-Commander  Space Navy What happened up  and they speeded up  too  Then your fly-boy  here  got fancy  That shook  em off  Time we got into the city  we d dropped them  Nice job of driving  Probably saved our lives Shucks  that wasn t nothin  
for politicians  you re either good or you re good and dead I m surprised they started so soon 
here in the hot sun I m Captain Nelson; New Texas Rangers 
one of you-all is Mr  Stephen Silk I just can t figure this out 
the right company  but we got a report  from a mighty good source  that you d been kidnapped at the spaceport by a gang of thugs!A blond source 
her  My efficient and conscientious chargé d affaires  Mr  Thrombley  felt that I should reach the Embassy  here  as soon as possible  and from where she was standing  it must have looked like a kidnapping  Fact is  it looked like one from where I was standing  too  Was that you and your people who were chasing us  Then I must apologize for opening fire on you     I hope nobody was hurt one of them  but no harm done  I reckon after what happened to Silas Cumshaw  you had a right to be suspicious Can I offer you a drink  Captain  in token of mutual amity 
Well  now  I d like to  Mr  Ambassador  but I m on duty    
Texas  and in this Embassy  you re in the territory of the Solar League That s right  now  Mr  Ambassador 
Wonderful thing  extraterritoriality And diplomatic immunity  too  Ain t it  Hoddy 
immediately  sir  Only a public statement  issued promptly  will relieve the crisis into which we have all been thrust Oh  come  Mr  Thrombley 
all that in his report to his superiors effect that you have assumed full responsibility for the Embassy  Where is that thing  Mr  Gomez!Here  sir; just sign here 
Are you crazy 
I ve taken an inventory of the physical property of the Embassy  and familiarized myself with all its commitments  and had the books audited by some firm of certified public accountants But we must have a statement of assumption of responsibility    
do anything Wait a moment  Thrombley 
attitude  I ve taken command of a good many ships and installations  at one time or another  and I ve never signed for anything I couldn t see and feel and count  I know men who retired as brigadier generals or vice-admirals  but they retired loaded with debts incurred because as second lieutenants or ensigns they forgot that simple rule Silk  this Embassy has been pretty badly disorganized since Mr  Cumshaw s death  No one felt authorized  or  to put it more accurately  no one dared  to declare himself acting head of the Embassy--Because that would make him the next target 
that s what I was sent here for  Mr  Gomez  as Secretary of the Embassy  will you please  at once  prepare a statement for the press and telecast release to the effect that I am now the authorized head of this Embassy  responsible from this hour for all its future policies and all its present commitments insofar as they obligate the government of the Solar League  Get that out at once  Tomorrow  I will present my credentials to the Secretary of State here  Thereafter  Mr  Thrombley  you can rest in the assurance that I ll be the one they ll be shooting at But you can t wait that long  Mr  Ambassador 
already going on Thrombley that the ship was in orbit off-planet got in  It ll be a barbecue  of course  and--Barbecued supercow! Yipeee!
five years!But we must hurry  Mr  Ambassador 
change  now  to formal dress    In native dress  Mr  Ambassador!
And armed!Consular Service  I sincerely hope that you will not take it amiss if I point out  here in private  that--direct order of Secretary of State Ghopal Singh I     I can t believe it!
armed nations and the usages of diplomatic practice  no fate of Mr  Cumshaw clearly indicates that the government of New Texas is not such a government  These pistols are in the nature of a not-too-subtle hint of the manner in which this government  here  is being regarded by the government of the Solar League Commander  what sort of an Embassy guard have we 
Space Marines  sergeant and five men  I double as guard officer  sir 
this fish-fry or whatever it is immediately  I want two men  a driver and an auto-rifleman  for my car  And from now on  I would suggest  Commander  that you wear your sidearm at all times outside the Embassy Yes  sir!
Well  I must phone the Statehouse  then 
to call on Secretary of State Palme  and then on President Hutchinson Space Navy on maneuvers about five light-years from here Sir Rodney Tregaskis hurry charter Tregaskis that the Ambassador at New Austin feels in need of protection; possibility of z Srauff invasion  I ll give you written orders  I want the Fleet within radio call  How far out would that be  with our facilities sir it comes  will probably not come from the direction of the z Srauff star-cluster; they ll probably jump past us and move in from the other side  I hope you don t think I m having nightmares  Commander  Danger of a z Srauff invasion was pointed out to me by persons on the very highest level  on Luna Especially since this special envoy arrived here  ostensibly to negotiate a meteor-mining treaty want the New Texans to know  of course  that you ve sent for the fleet Naturally not 
boat owned  manned and operated by Solar League people  The boat s a dreadful-looking old tub  but she s sound and fast  The gang who own her are pretty notorious characters--suspected of smuggling  piracy  and what not--but they ll keep their mouths shut if well paid Then pay them well 
at once  When I get back from this clambake  I ll want to have a general informal council  and I certainly want you in on it don t    We re dreadfully late 
kept the Secretary waiting too long Good afternoon  Mr  Thrombley 
new Ambassador  I suppose  And this--dear me!pleasureentirely acceptable to my government 
to meet you  Mr  Silk  If you will please come with me    Oh  dear  I always dread these things!
Yes  absolutely anything could happen 
Man  this is a real barbecue!

We will see the President and then    
    then we will all go to the barbecue 
Isn t that a replica of the Alamo

diplomat  I am Good day  Mr  Silk 
today if poor Silas Cumshaw d been as smart as you are  Great man  though; a wise and farseeing statesman  He and I were real friends You know who Mr  Silk brought with him as bodyguard

entitled to a fair trial!Down here!
And this better be good  Mr  Silk!
Space-attack shelter 
space-ships is one thing  but it s as much as a girl s reputation is worth to come down here during a barbecue Over this way 
anything going on over here  now It s been four years that I ve been away from here 
there s a reading room of the Law Library up here  Let s go in and enjoy the quiet for a while going to prepare for the next trial Now we re locked in 
trial s over What is this  Supreme Court 
No  Court of Political Justice 
going to try those three Bonney brothers  who killed Mr  Cumshaw That isn t the trial that s going on now  I hope 
arrange to attend  I don t know what this trial is  I only got home today  myself What s the procedure here 
Well  those nine men are judges 
President Judge Nelson  You ve met his son--the Ranger officer who chased you from the spaceport  He s a regular jurist  The other eight are prominent citizens who are drawn from a panel  like a jury  The men at the table on the left are the prosecution: friends of the politician who was killed  And the ones on the right are the defense: they ll try to prove that the dead man got what was coming to him  The ones in the middle are friends of the court: they re just anybody who has any interest in the case--people who want to get some point of law cleared up  or see some precedent established  or something like that You seem to assume that this is a homicide case 
but--Are you gentlemen ready 
Political Justice of the Confederate Continents of New Texas is now in session  Case of the friends of S  Austin Maverick  deceased  late of James Bowie Continent  versus Wilbur Whately My God  did somebody finally kill Aus Maverick 
The general nature of the case 
defendant  Wilbur Whately  of Sam Houston Continent  is here charged with divers offenses arising from the death of the Honorable S  Austin Maverick  whom he killed on the front steps of the Legislative Assembly Building  here in New Austin    I want to hear the specifications 
Please the court 
charged with political irresponsibility and excessive atrocity in exercising his constitutional right of criticism of a practicing politician    The court wanted to know how the defendant would plead  Somebody  without bothering to rise  said  defense table   There was a brief scraping of chairs; four of five men from the defense and the prosecution tables got up and advanced to confer in front of the bench  comparing sheets of paper  The man who had read the charges  obviously the chief prosecutor  made himself the spokesman     The defense answered affirmatively  I sat back  gaping like a fool  Why  that was practically--no  it  was --a confession    the judge said  
 As though there were any case to get on with! I fully expected them to take it on from there in song  words by Gilbert and music by Sullivan   prosecution--prosecution  for God s sake!--announced    the defense said  
    the defense demanded    said   Nelson inquired    in   The prosecution hemmed and hawed for a moment  and then announced  in a hasty mumble  that it rested    Judge Nelson said  
 And then  he actually closed the court; pressing a button on the bench  he raised a high black screen in front of him and his colleagues  It stayed up for some sixty seconds  and then dropped again    The defense lawyer motioned a young man who had been sitting beside him to rise  In the silence that had fallen  I could hear the defendant s boots squeaking as he went forward to hear his fate  The judge picked up a belt and a pair of pistols that had been lying in front of him    he began  
political irresponsibility; one of the associate judges felt that the late unmitigated scoundrel  Austin Maverick  ought to have been skinned alive  an inch at a time  You are  however  acquitted of that charge  too    he continued  addressing the entire assemblage  
 He leaned forward  extending the belt and holsters to the defendant    Some of the spectators  drooling for barbecued supercow  began crowding and jostling toward the exits; more of them were pushing to the front of the courtroom  cheering and waving their hip-flasks  The prosecution and about half of the friends of the court hastily left by a side door  probably to issue statements disassociating themselves from the deceased Maverick    I commented  as Gail and I went out  
  She was indignant  
  I was thoughtfully silent as we went out into the plaza  which was still a riot of noise and polychromatic costumes  And my thoughts were as weltered as the scene before me   Apparently  on New Texas  killing a politician wasn t regarded as  mallum in se   and was  mallum prohibitorum  only to the extent that what happened to the politician was in excess of what he deserved  I began to understand why Palme was such a scared rabbit  why Hutchinson had that hunted look and kept his hands always within inches of his pistols   I began to feel more pity than contempt for Thrombley  too   He s been on this planet too long and he should never have been sent here in the first place  I ll rotate him home as soon as possible       Then the full meaning of what I had seen finally got through to me: if they were going to try the killers of Cumshaw in that court  that meant that on New Texas  foreign diplomats were regarded as practicing politicians      That made me a practicing politician too!  And that s why  when we got back to the vicinity of the bandstand  I had my right hand close to my pistol  with my thumb on the inconspicuous little spot of silver inlay that operated the secret holster mechanism   I saw Hutchinson and Palme and Thrombley ahead  With them was a newcomer  a portly  ruddy-faced gentleman with a white mustache and goatee  dressed in a white suit  Gail broke away from me and ran toward him  This  I thought  would be her father; now I would be introduced and find out just what her last name was  I followed  more slowly  and saw a waiter  with a wheeled serving-table  move in behind the group which she had joined   So I saw what none of them did--the waiter suddenly reversed his long carving-knife and poised himself for a blow at President Hutchinson s back  I simply pressed the little silver stud on my belt  the Krupp-Tatta popped obediently out of the holster into my open hand  I thumbed off the safety and swung up; when my sights closed on the rising hand that held the knife  I fired   Hoddy Ringo  who had been holding a sandwich with one hand and a drink with the other  dropped both and jumped on the man whose hand I had smashed  A couple of Rangers closed in and grabbed him  also  The group around President Hutchinson had all turned and were staring from me to the man I had shot  and from him to the knife with the broken handle  lying on the ground   Hutchinson spoke first    Hoddy accused  
  the man with the white goatee said  
me   I holstered my automatic  and took his hand  Gail was saying  was doing it more formally:   Dumbarton Oaks had taught me how to maintain the proper diplomat s unchanging expression; drinking superbourbon had been a post-graduate course  I needed that training as I finally learned Gail s last name      CHAPTER VI   It was early evening before we finally managed to get away from the barbecue  Thrombley had called the Embassy and told them not to wait dinner for us  so the staff had finished eating and were relaxing in the patio when our car came in through the street gate  Stonehenge and another man came over to meet us as we got out--a man I hadn t met before   He was a little fellow  half-Latin  half-Oriental; in New Texas costume and wearing a pair of pistols like mine  in State Department Special Services holsters  He didn t look like a Dumbarton Oaks product: I thought he was more likely an alumnus of some private detective agency     Parros said  
  We went over and sat down at one of the big tables under the arches at the side of the patio    I said  
as the Intelligence man picked up a bottle and made to pour for me     Thrombley stirred uneasily     I wondered what he d say if I told him that I thought it was deliberate      So they began; Thrombley  Stonehenge and Parros doing the talking  It came to this:  Ever since we had first established an Embassy on New Texas  the goal of our diplomacy on this planet had been to secure it into the Solar League  And it was a goal which seemed very little closer to realization now than it had been twenty-three years before      told him    Thrombley wasn t much in the way of an ally  but at least he had a sound  selfish motive for helping me stay alive  I assured him I would get him sent back to Luna  and then went on with the discussion   Up until six months ago  Silas Cumshaw had modeled himself after the typical New Texas politician  He had always worn at least two faces  and had always managed to place himself on every side of every issue at once  Nothing he ever said could possibly be construed as controversial  Naturally  the cause of New Texan annexation to the Solar League had made no progress whatever   Then  one evening  at a banquet  he had executed a complete 180-degree turn  delivering a speech in which he proclaimed that union with the Solar League was the only possible way in which New Texans could retain even a vestige of local sovereignty  He had talked about an invasion as though the enemy s ships were already coming out of hyperspace  and had named the invader  calling the z Srauff Ambassador  also present  had immediately gotten up and stalked out  amid a derisive chorus of barking and baying from the New Texans  The New Texans were first shocked and then wildly delighted; they had been so used to hearing nothing but inanities and high-order abstractions from their public figures that the Solar League Ambassador had become a hero overnight     Parros told me  
  I said  
  Thrombley replied  
celebrating some military victory by the Texans on Terra  a battle called San Jacinto  We didn t have any business to handle  because all the local officials were home nursing hangovers  so when Colonel Hickock called--Who 
at the barbecue  He and Mr  Cumshaw had become great friends  beginning shortly before the speech the Ambassador made at that banquet  He called about 0900  inviting Mr  Cumshaw out to his ranch for the day  and as there was nothing in the way of official business  Mr  Cumshaw said he d be out by 1030    over  from the ranch house caught their jet assembly  and they could only get as far as Bonneyville  thirty miles away  before they had to land  They landed right in front of the town jail   Turkey-Buzzard Tom Bonney--immediately claimed sanctuary in the jail  on the grounds that they had been near to--get that; I think that indicates the line they re going to take at the trial-- near  to a political assassination  They were immediately given the protection of the jail  which is about the only well-constructed building in the place  practically a fort You think that was planned in advance 
these Bonneys at the jail  almost the entire able-bodied population of the place  As soon as Switchblade and Jack-High and Turkey-Buzzard landed  they were rushed inside and all the doors barred  About three minutes later  the Hickock outfit started coming in  first aircraft and then armor  They gave that town a regular Georgie Patton style blitzing Yes  I m only sorry I wasn t there to see it 
knocked down or burned most of the shanties  and then they went to work on the jail  The aircraft began dumping these firebombs and stun-bombs that they use to stop supercow stampedes  and the tank-guns began to punch holes in the walls  As soon as Kettle-Belly saw what he had on his hands  he radioed a call for Ranger protection  Our friend Captain Nelson went out to see what the trouble was Yes  I got the story of that from Nelson 
hated to do it  he had to protect the Bonneys  And as soon as he d taken a hand  Hickock had to call off his gang  But he was smart  He grabbed everything relating to the killing--the aircar and the twenty-mm auto-rifle in particular--and he s keeping them under cover  Very few people know about that  or about the fact that on physical evidence alone  he has the killing pinned on the Bonneys so well that they ll never get away with this story of being merely innocent witnesses The rest  Mr  Silk  is up to us 
Hickock s assurance that he will give us every assistance  but we simply must see to it that those creatures with the outlandish names are convicted Good evening  Captain 
you re on foreign soil and consequently not on duty I thought you might be interested 
going-over  We wanted to know who put him up to it  He tried to sell us the line that he was a New Texan patriot  trying to kill a tyrant  but we finally got the truth out of him  He was paid a thousand pesos to do the job  by a character they call Snake-Eyes Sam Bonney  A cousin of the three who killed Mr  Cumshaw Nephew of Kettle-Belly Sam 
You pick him up 
somewhere  We re still looking for him  Oh  yes  and I just heard that the trial of Switchblade  and Jack-High and Turkey-Buzzard is scheduled for three days from now  You ll be notified in due form tomorrow  but I thought you might like to know in advance you when you arrived whatever you call it  of that trio boys didn t get hold of them before I got there  It d of saved everybody a lot of trouble Just what impression did you get at the time  Captain 
think Kettle-Belly knew in advance what they were going to do is  to keep people from getting out; but like a fort  to keep people from getting in  There were no prisoners inside  I found out that they had all been released that morning that I figure went wrong with their plans    He cocked an eyebrow and I nodded  The Solar League  in similar cases  had regarded such planetary governments as due for change without notice and had promptly made the change    Captain Nelson continued  
 him   The big Ranger grinned  were trying to defend the mayor s office and the warden s office  These Bonneys gave me the line that they d been witnesses to the killing of Mr  Cumshaw by Colonel Hickock and that the Hickock outfit was trying to rub them out to keep them from testifying  I just laughed and started to walk out  Finally  they confessed that they d shot Mr  Cumshaw  but they claimed it was right of action against political malfeasance  When they did that  I had to take them in They confessed to you  before you arrested them 
held  And that ain t all: we got their fingerprints off the car  off the gun  off some shells still in the clip  and we have the gun identified to the shells that killed Mr  Cumshaw  We got their confession fully corroborated You ll have to look to your laurels  Hoddy 
Ambassador seems to be making quite a reputation for himself as a gunfighter Look 
shoot myself  That way  I could be sure I d get a nice painless job to be a carefully prearranged killing Hickock s front steps at about 1030   How did they find that out  Why     why  I m sure I don t know 
called at 0900  Mr  Cumshaw left the Embassy in an aircar a few minutes later  It took an hour and a half to fly out to the Hickock ranch    I don t like the implications  Mr  Silk 
believe that was how it happened  In the first place  Colonel Hickock isn t that sort of man: he doesn t use his hospitality to trap people to their death  In the second place  he wouldn t have needed to use people like these Bonneys  His own men would do anything for him  In the third place  he is one of the leaders of the annexation movement here and this was obviously an anti-annexation job  And in the fourth place--Hold it!
side Silk  But  remember  when Colonel Hickock came here as our first Ambassador  he came here as a man with a mission  He had studied the problem and he believed in what he came for  He has never changed   Colonel and Mr  Cumshaw were really friends Now you re talking!
was a kid  Ever since he married old Colonel MacTodd s daughter  That just ain t the way A  J  works!On the other hand  Mr  Ambassador 
did do everything in his power to see that these Bonney brothers did not reach court alive  And  let me add Hickock told them  or we have--and this is unbelievable--a traitor in the Embassy itself Nobody who knew could have told the Bonney boys where Mr  Cumshaw would be at 1030  yet the three men were there waiting for him  You take it from there  I m just a simple military man and I m ready to go back to the simple military life as soon as possible official telescreen log  Let s see what calls were made  Maybe Mr  Cumshaw himself said something to someone that gave his destination away That won t be necessary 
were on duty  and I took the only three calls that came in  myself  First  there was the call from Colonel Hickock  Then  the call about the wrist watch  And then  a couple of hours later  the call from the Hickock ranch  about Mr  Cumshaw s death What was the call about the wrist watch 
Oh  that was from the z Srauff Embassy 
time  Mr  Cumshaw had been trying to get one of the very precise watches which the z Srauff manufacture on their home planet  The z Srauff Ambassador called  that day  to tell him that they had one for him and wanted to know when it was to be delivered  I told them the Ambassador was out  and they wanted to know where they could call him and I--Oh  my God! I m the one who told them!
Thrombley  You did the natural  the normal  the proper thing  on a call from one Ambassador to another Ambassador had left the Embassy  Alone  right  And that was just what they d been waiting for     Stonehenge interrupted  
 Stonehenge deliberately paused  let that last phrase hang heavily in the air for a moment  then he continued   electric shock  or ringing a little bell  all over New Texas  at exactly the same moment  And then I can imagine all the z Srauff running down into nice deep holes in the ground at the spaceport by now  ready to blast off  I wonder if someone could drive me there I ll drive him  boss 
I ain t doin  nothin  else 
I have a lot of stuff here 
have noticed  For instance--Commander Stonehenge s going to the spaceport  now 
the way  Then  when he s aboard  come back and tell us What do you think of our planet now  Mr  Silk 
I received Especially with your opinion of local political practices  Politics is nothing  here  if not exciting and exacting You don t understand it though 
pigeons Well  it is rather unusual    
Yes 
 Century  Liberal  on end  And it gives us the freest government anywhere in the galaxy   invaded or threatened their rights became an acknowledged part of our political system     said forcefully  and powerful and it s your master  We don t want any masters here on New Texas But the President has a bodyguard 
Casualty rate was too high 
President s job is inherently impossible: he has to represent  all  the people your rancher oligarchy the morning  they d find my body in an irrigation ditch before sunset      We left the Hickock ranch on Sunday afternoon and while Hoddy guided our air-car back to New Austin  I had a little time to revise some of my ideas about New Texas  That is  I had time to think during those few moments when Hoddy wasn t taking advantage of our diplomatic immunity to invent new air-ground traffic laws   My thoughts alternated between the pleasure of remembering Gail s gay company and the gloom of understanding the complete implications of the Colonel s clarifying lectures  Against the background of his remarks  I could find myself appreciating the Ghopal-Klüng-Natalenko reasoning: the only way to cut the Gordian knot was to have another Solar League Ambassador killed   And  whenever I could escape thinking about the fact that the next Ambassador to be the clay pigeon was me  I found myself wondering if I wanted the League to take over  Annexation  yes; New Texas customs would be protected under a treaty of annexation  But the urged by Machiavelli  Jr   No   I was still struggling with the problem when we reached the Embassy about 1700  Everyone was there  including Stonehenge  who had returned two hours earlier with the good news that the fleet had moved into position only sixty light-minutes off Capella IV  I had reached the point in my thinking where I had decided it was useless to keep Hoddy and Stonehenge apart except as an exercise in mental agility  Inasmuch as my brain was already weight-lifting  swinging from a flying trapeze to elusive flying rings while doing triple somersaults and at the same time juggling seven Indian clubs  I skipped the whole matter   But I m fairly certain that it wasn t till then that Hoddy had a chance to deliver his letter-of-credence to Stonehenge   After dinner  we gathered in my office for our coffee and a final conference before the opening of the trial the next morning   Stonehenge spoke first  looking around the table at everyone except me     No matter what happens   I thought glumly  and the phrase explained why he hadn t been able to look at me    Hoddy said  
  Stonehenge said  
  Parros told him  
    at the trial  They have a lawyer  Clement A  Sidney  a member of what passes for the Socialist Party on this planet  The defense will take the line of full denial of everything  The Bonneys are just three poor but honest boys who are being framed by the corrupt tools of the Big Ranching Interests Whatta we got to worry about  then 
They re a cinch for conviction 
I agree with that 
defense on political conviction and opposition by the Solar League  they might have a chance  This way  they haven t All right  gentlemen 
must all follow a single line of policy and not work at cross-purposes to each other circumstances  allow those three brothers to be convicted in this court remarkable statement  but I must say--It was a really colossal error on somebody s part 
case was allowed to get into the Court of Political Justice  It never should have  And if we take a part in the prosecution  or allow those men to be convicted  we will establish a precedent to support the principle that a foreign Ambassador is  on this planet  defined as a practicing local politician    A moment was all they needed  Thrombley was horrified and dithered incoherently  Stonehenge frowned and fidgeted with some papers in front of him  I could see several thoughts gathering behind his eyes  including  I was sure  a new view of his instructions from Klüng   Even Hoddy got at least part of it    Thrombley told him  
  Stonehenge picked it up  
 an army of New Texas Rangers  each with a warrant for Hoddy Ringo  battering at the gates     Stonehenge said  
 I had been thinking about this and I was ready    Parros said  
 I wasn t surprised that he didn t see it; he hadn t had the same urgency goading him which had forced me to find the answer  It wasn t an answer that I liked  but I was in the position where I had no choice   respectful way they regarded me  from the attention they were giving my words  I got a sudden thrill of pride  For the first time since my scrambled arrival  I was really  Ambassador  Stephen Silk      CHAPTER VIII   A couple of New Texas Ranger tanks met the Embassy car four blocks from the Statehouse and convoyed us into the central plaza  where the barbecue had been held on the Friday afternoon that I had arrived on New Texas  There was almost as dense a crowd as the last time I had seen the place; but they were quieter  to the extent that there were no bands  and no shooting  no cowbells or whistles  The barbecue pits were going again  however  and hawkers were pushing or propelling their little wagons about  vending sandwiches  I saw a half a dozen big twenty-foot teleview screens  apparently wired from the courtroom   As soon as the Embassy car and its escorting tanks reached the plaza  an ovation broke out  I was cheered  with the high-pitched  yipeee!  of New Texans and adjured and implored not to let them so-and-sos get away with it   There was a veritable army of Rangers on guard at the doors of the courtroom  The only spectators being admitted to the courtroom seemed to be prominent citizens with enough pull to secure passes   Inside  some of the spectators  benches had been removed to clear the front of the room  In the cleared space  there was one bulky shape under a cloth cover that seemed to be the air-car and another cloth-covered shape that looked like a fifty-mm dual-purpose gun  Smaller exhibits  including a twenty-mm auto-rifle  were piled on the friends-of-the-court table  The prosecution table was already occupied--Colonel Hickock  who waved a greeting to me  three or four men who looked like well-to-do ranchers  and a delegation of lawyers   heavy-set man with white hair  dressed in a dark suit of the cut that had been fashionable on Terra seventy-five years ago   There was quite a swarm at the center table  too  Some of them were ranchers  a couple in aggressively shabby workclothes  and there were several members of the Diplomatic Corps  I shook hands with them and gathered that they  like myself  were worried about the precedent that might be established by this trial  While I was introducing Hoddy Ringo as my attaché extraordinary  which was no less than the truth  the defense party came in   There were only three lawyers--a little  rodent-faced fellow  whom Parros pointed out as Clement Sidney  and two assistants  And  guarded by a Ranger and a couple of court-bailiffs  the three defendants  Switchblade Joe  Jack-High Abe and Turkey-Buzzard Tom Bonney  There was probably a year or so age different from one to another  but they certainly had a common parentage  They all had pale eyes and narrow  loose-lipped faces  Subnormal and probably psychopathic  I thought  Jack-High Abe had his left arm in a sling and his left shoulder in a plaster cast  The buzz of conversation among the spectators altered its tone subtly and took on a note of hostility as they entered and seated themselves   The balcony seemed to be crowded with press representatives  Several telecast cameras and sound pickups had been rigged to cover the front of the room from various angles  a feature that had been missing from the trial I had seen with Gail on Friday   Then the judges entered from a door behind the bench  which must have opened from a passageway under the plaza  and the court was called to order   The President Judge was the same Nelson who had presided at the Whately trial and the first thing on the agenda seemed to be the selection of a new board of associate judges  Parros explained in a whisper that the board which had served on the previous trial would sit until that could be done   A slip of paper was drawn from a box and a name was called  A man sitting on one of the front rows of spectators  seats got up and came forward  One of Sidney s assistants rummaged through a card file he had in front of him and handed a card to the chief of the defense  At once  Sidney was on his feet    he called out  
  the venireman declared  
  Sidney almost screamed  
 Judge Nelson pounded with his gavel   he said  
 The next man was challenged: he was a retired packing-house operator in New Austin  and had once expressed the opinion that Bonneyville and everybody in it ought to be H-bombed off the face of New Texas   This Sidney seemed to have gotten the name of everybody likely to be called for court duty and had something on each one of them  because he went on like that all morning   Parros    Hoddy offered  
  I decided  
  We took an hour  at noon  for lunch  and then it began again  By 1647  fifteen minutes before court should be adjourned  Judge Nelson ordered the bailiff to turn the clock back to 1300  The clock was turned back again when it reached 1645  By this time  Clement Sidney was probably the most unpopular man on New Texas   Finally  Colonel Andrew J  Hickock rose to his feet    Sidney began yelling protests  Hoddy Ringo pulled his neckerchief around under his left ear and held the ends above his head  Nanadabadian  the Ambassador from Beta Cephus IV  drew his biggest knife and began trying the edge on a sheet of paper     rapped with his gavel      CHAPTER IX   The trial got started the next morning with a minimum amount of objections from Sidney  The charges and specifications were duly read  the three defendants pleaded not guilty  and then Goodham advanced with a paper in his hand to address the court  Sidney scampered up to take his position beside him    In all my planning  I d forgotten that  I couldn t let those stipulations stand without protest  and at the same time  if I protested the characterization of Cumshaw as a practicing politician  the trial could easily end right there  So I prayed for a miracle  and Clement Sidney promptly obliged me    he barked  
 Judge Nelson s gavel hit the bench with a crack like a rifle shot    I settled back with a deep sigh of relief which got me  I noticed  curious stares from my fellow Ambassadors  I disregarded the questions in their glances; I had what I wanted   They began calling up the witnesses   First  the doctor who had certified Ambassador Cumshaw s death  He gave a concise description of the wounds which had killed my predecessor  Sidney was trying to make something out of the fact that he was Hickock s family physician  and consuming more time  when I got up       Judge Nelson rapped sharply    He nodded to me  
  It was  so I turned to the witness  
 He chuckled     I picked up the 20-mm auto-rifle--it weighed a good sixty pounds--from the table  and asked him if this weapon could have inflicted such wounds  He agreed that it both could and had     I asked the same question when I cross-examined the ballistics witness      I remarked  
 That  of course  brought Sidney to his feet  sputtering objections to this attempt to disparage the honest poverty of his clients  which only helped to call attention to the point   Then the prosecution called in a witness named David Crockett Longfellow  I d met him at the Hickock ranch; he was Hickock s butler  He limped from an old injury which had retired him from work on the range  He was sworn in and testified to his name and occupation    replied   Sidney was up at once  shouting objections  After he was quieted down  Goodham remarked that he d come to that point later  and began a line of questioning to establish that Longfellow had been on the Hickock ranch on the day when Silas Cumshaw was killed    Goodham said  
 Longfellow began his story  Little single-seat job that he drove himself  He landed it about a hundred feet from the outside veranda  like he usually did  and got out    Goodham waited a few moments  Longfellow s voice had choked and there was a twitching about his face  as though he were trying to suppress tears    Goodham said  
  He looked at Jack-High in coldly poisonous hatred  
   Further questioning revealed that Longfellow had had no direct knowledge of the pursuit  or the siege of the jail in Bonneyville  Colonel Hickock had taken personal command of that  and had left Longfellow behind to call the Solar League Embassy and the Rangers  He had made no attempt to move the body  but had left it lying in the driveway until the doctor and the Rangers arrived   Goodham went to the middle table and picked up a heavy automatic pistol   to Longfellow   Longfellow was almost insulted by the question  Of course he knew his own pistol  He recited the serial number  and pointed to different scars and scratches on the weapon  telling how they had been acquired   said   It was  although Longfellow resented the qualification    Sidney began an immediate attack   Questioning Longfellow s eyesight  intelligence  honesty and integrity  he tried to show personal enmity toward the Bonneys  He implied that Longfellow had been conspiring with Cumshaw to bring about the conquest of New Texas by the Solar League  The verbal exchange became so heated that both witness and attorney had to be admonished repeatedly from the bench  But at no point did Sidney shake Longfellow from his one fundamental statement  that the Bonney brothers had shot Silas Cumshaw and that he had shot Jack-High Abe Bonney in the shoulder   When he was finished  I got up and took over    I began  
   Nobody  But the aircar had obviously been waiting for Mr  Cumshaw; the Bonneys must have had advance knowledge  My questions made that point clear despite the obvious--and reluctantly court-sustained--objections from Mr  Sidney    There being none  Longfellow stepped down  It was then a few minutes before noon  so Judge Nelson recessed court for an hour and a half    In the afternoon  the surgeon who had treated Jack-High Abe Bonney s wounded shoulder testified  identifying the bullet which had been extracted from Bonney s shoulder  A ballistics man from Ranger crime-lab followed him to the stand and testified that it had been fired from Longfellow s Colt  Then Ranger Captain Nelson took the stand  His testimony was about what he had given me at the Embassy  with the exception that the Bonneys  admission that they had shot Ambassador Cumshaw was ruled out as having been made under duress   However  Captain Nelson s testimony didn t need the confessions   The cover was stripped off the air-car  and a couple of men with a power-dolly dragged it out in front of the bench  The Ranger Captain identified it as the car which he had found at the Bonneyville jail  He went over it with an ultra-violet flashlight and showed where he had written his name and the date on it with fluorescent ink  The effects of AA-fire were plainly evident on it   Then the other shrouded object was unveiled and identified as the gun which had disabled the air-car  Colonel Hickock identified the gun as the one with which he had fired on the air-car  Finally  the ballistics expert was brought back to the stand again  to link the two by means of fragments found in the car   Then Goodham brought Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney to the stand   The Mayor of Bonneyville was a man of fifty or so  short  partially bald  dressed in faded blue Levis  a frayed white shirt  and a grease-spotted vest  There was absolutely no mystery about how he had acquired his nickname  He disgorged a cud of tobacco into a spittoon  took the oath with unctuous solemnity  then reloaded himself with another chew and told his version of the attack on the jail   At about 1045 on the day in question  he testified  he had been in his office  hard at work in the public service  when an air-car  partially disabled by gunfire  had landed in the street outside and the three defendants had rushed in  claiming sanctuary  From then on  the story flowed along smoothly  following the lines predicted by Captain Nelson and Parros  Of course he had given the fugitives shelter; they had claimed to have been near to a political assassination and were in fear of their lives   Under Sidney s cross-examination  and coaching  he poured out the story of Bonneyville s wrongs at the hands of the reactionary landowners  and the atrocious behavior of the Hickock goon-gang  Finally  after extracting the last drop of class-hatred venom out of him  Sidney turned him over to me    He couldn t rightly say  maybe four or five      It took a good five minutes before Sidney stopped shouting long enough for Judge Nelson to sustain the objection        Kettle-Belly Sam didn t answer   pressing   out about half as far as his midriff     I replied to the voice  
turned to the witness   As Bonney left the stand and was led out the side door  Goodham addressed the bench    he said  
 Followed a long succession of witnesses  each testifying to some public or private act of philanthropy  some noble trait of character  It was the sort of thing which the defense lawyer in the Whately case had been so willing to stipulate  Sidney  of course  tried to make it all out to be part of a sinister conspiracy to establish a Solar League fifth column on New Texas  Finally  the prosecution rested its case   I entertained Gail and her father at the Embassy  that evening  The street outside was crowded with New Texans  all of them on our side  shouting slogans like   and 
 and 
too  The Hickocks  father and daughter  were given a tremendous ovation  when they finally left  and followed to their hotel by cheering crowds  I saw one big banner  lettered:  DON T LET NEW TEXAS GO TO THE DOGS   and bearing a crude picture of a z Srauff  I seemed to recall having seen a couple of our Marines making that banner the evening before in the Embassy patio  but         CHAPTER X   The next morning  the third of the trial  opened with the defense witnesses  character-witnesses for the three killers and witnesses to the political iniquities of Silas Cumshaw   Neither Goodham nor I bothered to cross-examine the former  I couldn t see how any lawyer as shrewd as Sidney had shown himself to be would even dream of getting such an array of thugs  cutthroats  sluts and slatterns into court as character witnesses for anybody   The latter  on the other hand  we went after unmercifully  revealing  under their enmity for Cumshaw  a small  hard core of bigoted xenophobia and selfish fear  Goodham did a beautiful job on that; he seemed able  at a glance  to divine exactly what each witness s motivation was  and able to make him or her betray that motivation in its least admirable terms  Finally the defense rested  about a quarter-hour before noon   I rose and addressed the court:   Sidney  who had begun shouting objections as soon as I had gotten to my feet  finally managed to get himself recognized by the court     Judge Nelson said  
 He glanced at his watch  
 I assured him I could after glancing across the room at Ranger Captain Nelson and catching his nod    My first witness  that afternoon was Thrombley  After the formalities of getting his name and connection with the Solar League Embassy on the record  I asked him     Thrombley said he had  
      sweeping glance   Sidney got up  started toward the witness stand  and then thought better of it    The next witness was a Mr  James Finnegan; he was identified as cashier of the Crooked Creek National Bank  I asked him if Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney did business at his bank; he said yes          Kettle-Belly  This time  there was no letter; just one of our regular deposit-slips  No name of depositor  I held the check  and gave it to Kettle-Belly  I remember  when it came in  I said to one of the clerks   Well  I wonder who s going to get bumped off this time   And sure enough    Objection!
English  was apparently taken away by Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney  If you saw another letter of the same sort  would you be able to say whether or not it might be like the one you mentioned Not at all  Mr  Sidney 
if Mr  Finnegan could say whether one document bore any resemblance to another And whose account received this anonymous benefaction  Mr  Boone 
The account 
of Mr  Clement Sidney 
I can t pronounce this-here thing  at all 
Your Honor  how am I gonna go about swearing him in 
does a z Srauff swear by  that s binding well enough to translate the oath I think I can 
Service  before I was sent here  We use Basic with a great many alien peoples Administer the oath  then 
Put up right hand 
Great One who made all worlds  who has knowledge of what is in the hearts of all persons  that what you will say here will be true  all true  and not anything that is not true  and will you so say again at time when all worlds end  Do you so truly say Yes  I so truly say

Mr  Ambassador 
in the used-car business  Am I expected to believe that this     this being     sold that air-car for a hundred pesos Vehicles Registration Bureau I introduce it as evidence

as part of his knowledge that he may put himself in trouble by what he says to answer these questions That is all  Your Honor 
And now 
court  speaking both as  amicus curiae  and as Ambassador of the Solar League  This court cannot convict the three men who are here on trial  These men should have never been brought to trial in this court: it has no jurisdiction over this case  This was a simple case of first-degree murder  by hired assassins  committed against the Ambassador of one government at the instigation of another  not an act of political protest within the meaning of New Texan law statement you have just made Gladly  Your Honor 
protection to persons engaged in the practice of politics  An act of personal injury against a politician is considered criminal only to the extent that the politician injured has not  by his public acts  deserved the degree of severity with which he has been injured  and the Court of Political Justice is established for the purpose of determining whether or not there has been such an excess of severity in the treatment meted out by the accused to the injured or deceased politician  This gives rise  of course  to some interesting practices; for instance  what is at law a trial of the accused is  in substance  a trial of his victim  But in any case tried in this court  the accused must be a person who has injured or killed a man who is definable as a practicing politician under the government of New Texas     Judge Nelson said gravely  
  I said  
government of New Texas  My government now knows who procured the death of Silas Cumshaw  and we will take appropriate action  The government of New Texas has now had spelled out  in letters anyone can read  the fact that this beautiful planet is in truth a  battleground   Awareness of this may save New Texas from being the scene of a larger and more destructive battle  New Texas also knows who are its enemies  and who can be counted upon to stand as its friends comment  Well  we ll have to close the court  to consider this phase of the question Stephen! How  could  you 
You ve gotten those murdering snakes turned loose!of my best friends!one of my instructors at Dumbarton Oaks  and I have always had the deepest respect and admiration for him  But he taught me one thing  which you seem to have forgotten since you expatriated yourself--that in the Diplomatic Service  personal feelings don t count  The only thing of importance is the advancement of the policies of the Solar League Altair II Bonney  together with your counsel  approach the court and hear the verdict It pains me inexpressibly 
that this court cannot convict you of the cowardly murder of that learned and honorable old man  Silas Cumshaw  nor can you be brought to trial in any other court on New Texas again for that dastardly crime  Here are your weapons  which must be returned to you  Sort them out yourselves  because I won t dirty my fingers on them  And may you regret and feel shame for your despicable act as long as you live  which I hope won t be more than a few hours There!
go up and congratulate him  too In about two minutes 
or weep over my corpse  Right now  though  you d better be getting behind something solid Hold it!
politician  but you still have killing a Solar League Ambassador to answer for  Now get your hands full of guns  if you don t want to die with them empty!adjourned-reconvene-0900-tomorrow   Hit the floor! Damn! He means it!
Your Honor

get the hell outa here We shall have to give up  Gregory 
Why  Anthony 
Look  Another typical reaction; retreat to the foetus 
send him back And look for no more 
I will never give up!
Anthony!
That means nothing 
cortico-thalamic integration I want to believe it  but I m afraid to 
Just who are you people 
just where am I I ve dreamed of the day when I could say this!
Congratulations  Gregory!
I believe I asked a couple of questions 
mutual admiration session  but I would appreciate some answers  This isn t anything like the situation I last remember    He remembers!
by symbolic logic  and it strengthens the validity of the second    Save that for later  Paula 
your theories about why memories are unimpaired when you time-jump forward and lost when you reverse the process  but let s stick to business  We have what we wanted; now let s use what we have I never liked the way you made your money 
but when you talk  it makes sense  Let s get on with it 
I believe you had better    
question   Where am I   that will have to be rephrased  If you ask   When and where am I   I can furnish a rational answer  In the temporal dimension  you are fifty years futureward of the day of your death; spatially  you are about eight thousand miles from the place of your death  in what is now the World Capitol  St  Louis team  but I didn t think it was that good No  no 
At least not yet  But if The Guide keeps on insisting that only beautiful things are good and that he is uniquely qualified to define beauty  watch his rule change into just that delusions  about his public statements    Idolatry!
in spirit!I made a joke 
of you got it has done more to prove that I am fifty years in the future than anything any of you could say Yes; I remember! Baseball!
now  The Guide will not allow competitive sports; he says that they foster the spirit of violence    You probably know more history than any of us 
Suppose you tell him what the score is 
interpretation s strictly capitalist  of course You first  Gregory 
how he got here  and then I ll tell him why I believe 
some use of the subject of time-travel  It was not  however  given serious consideration  largely because of certain alleged paradoxes involved  and because of an elementalistic and objectifying attitude toward the whole subject of time  I won t go into the mathematics and symbolic logic involved  but we have disposed of the objections; more  we have succeeded in constructing a time-machine  if you want to call it that  We prefer to call it a temporal-spatial displacement field generator It s really very simple 
universe is expanding  time is a widening spiral; if contracting  a diminishing spiral; if static  a uniform spiral  The possibility of pulsation was our only worry    That s no worry 
too slow to have an effect on    microsecond  but where is the instrument to measure a temporal pulsation that may require years     You haven t come to that yet Be quiet  both of you!
converted to the godlessness of The Guide  and other thousands of his dupes are dying  unprepared to face their Maker!All right  you invented a time-machine 
was only a high school chemistry teacher  I can tell a class of juniors the difference between H {2}O and H {2}SO {4}  but the theory of time-travel is wasted on me     Suppose you just let me ask the questions; then I ll be sure of finding out what I don t know  For instance  who won the war I was fighting in  before you grabbed me and brought me here  The Commies No  the United Nations 
least exhausted when both sides decided to quit Then what s this dictatorship     The Guide  Extreme Rightist 
Walter  you d better tell him 
We damn near lost the war 
broken up--India  China  Indonesia  Mongolia  Russia  the Ukraine  all the Satellite States  Most of them turned into little dictatorships  like the Latin American countries after the liberation from Spain  but they were personal  non-ideological  generally benevolent  dictatorships  the kind that can grow into democracies  if they re given time Capitalistic dictatorships  he means 
Be quiet  Carl 
class-struggle stuff Actually  the United Nations rules the world 
goes on in the Ukraine or Latvia or Manchuria is about analogous to what went on under the old United States government in  let s say  Tammany-ruled New York  But here s the catch  The UN is ruled absolutely by one man subdivided and compartmented that it couldn t even run a war properly  Our army commanders were making war by systematic disobedience The charter was changed shortly after     er  that is  after    
After my death 
charter  how did one man get all the powers into his hands By sorcery!
his master  Satan!You know  there are times when some such theory tempts me 
He was a big moneybags 
York was bombed flat  Where the old UN buildings were  it s still hot  So The Guide donated a big tract of land outside St  Louis  built these buildings--we re in the basement of one of them  right now  if you want a good laugh--and before long  he had the whole organization eating out of his hand  They just voted him into power  and the world into slavery altruism  integrity and wisdom blasphemous to say anything against him  I really don t understand how it happened    Well  what s he been doing with his power 
or stupid ones political and other liberties  It is best to be specific Gregory 
yet  It s different in other fields  For instance  all research in sonics has been arbitrarily stopped  So has a great deal of work in organic and synthetic chemistry  Psychology is a madhouse of     what was the old word  licentiousness  No  lysenkoism  Medicine and surgery--well  there s a huge program of compulsory sterilization  and another one of eugenic marriage-control  And infants who don t conform to certain physical standards don t survive  Neither do people who have disfiguring accidents beyond the power of plastic surgery you an audio-visual of an interesting ceremony in a Hindu village  derived from the ancient custom of the suttee  It is the Hindu method of conforming to The Guide s demand that only beautiful children be allowed to grow to maturity and in Europe We have lethal-gas chambers that even Hitler would have envied 
I am a musician 
sciences are controlled  he should try to write even the simplest piece of music  The extent of censorship and control over all the arts  and especially music  is incredible another motive  a more selfish one  I am approaching the compulsory retirement age; I will soon be invited to go to one of the Havens  Even though these Havens are located in the most barren places  they are beauty-spots  verdant beyond belief  It is of only passing interest that  while large numbers of the aged go there yearly  their populations remain constant  and  to judge from the quantities of supplies shipped to them  extremely small They call me Samuel  in this organization 
here in an effort to live up to it  Although I am ordained by no church  I fight for all of them  The plain fact is that this man we call The Guide is really the Antichrist!me willing to finance this project Guide won t let people make money  and if they do  he taxes it away from them  And he has laws to prohibit inheritance; what little you can accumulate  you can t pass on to your children I put up a lot of the money  too  don t forget 
Union did; I m a poor man  myself working man in North America  Europe  Australia and South Africa belongs to it  And The Guide has us all hog-tied He won t let you strike 
closed-shop contracts stick  And as far as getting anything like a pay-raise    them  the way The Guide has us under his thumb    you two realize that you re both on the same side  and that what hurts one hurts both neither Labor nor Management had learned that the enemies he s made on the UN Capitol grounds  In fact  except for a small police-force  armed only with non-lethal stun-guns  your profession of arms is non-existent I ve been guessing what you want me to do 
Guide bumped off  But why can t any of you do it  Or  if it s too risky  at least somebody from your own time  Why me especially the taking of human life Now  wait a moment!
you showed me weren t dying of old age    That is not violence 
beneficence  Ugly people would be unhappy  and would make others unhappy  in a world where everybody else is beautiful And all these oppressive and tyrannical laws 
does he enforce them  without violence  actual or threatened know music has something to do with it  because there is always music  everywhere  This laboratory  for instance  was secretly soundproofed; we couldn t have worked here  otherwise a soldier  whose conditioning has been in favor rather than against violence  I m not the only one you snatched  I take it over the world and all over history them could adjust     Uggh!He s thinking 
blew out his brains with a pocket-pistol on that table  and an English archer from Agincourt who ran amok with a dagger in here  and a trooper of the Seventh Cavalry from the Custer Massacre take our subjects largely at random with regard to individual characteristics  mental attitudes  adaptability  et cetera from their professional lack of repugnance for violence  we took soldiers from battlefields because we could select men facing immediate death  whose removal from the past would not have any effect upon the casual chain of events affecting the present I can see that 
the past  That was always one of the favorite paradoxes in time-travel fiction     Well  I think I have the general picture  You have a dictator who is tyrannizing you; you want to get rid of him; you can t kill him yourselves  I m opposed to dictators  myself; that--and the Selective Service law  of course--was why I was a soldier  I have no moral or psychological taboos against killing dictators  or anybody else  Suppose I cooperate with you; what s in it for me Your return to your own time and place 
And if I don t cooperate with you 
Guess when and where else we could send you 
Exactly the same time and place 
Well  the structure of space-time demands    
spot--coordinates in the universe  However  to avoid disruption of the structure of space-time  we must return you to approximately the same point in space-time All right; tell me exactly what you want me to do 
Shut up  all of you!
I worked this out  so let me tell it 
tougher than the rest of them  or maybe I m not as deeply conditioned  For one thing  I m tone-deaf  Well  here s the way it is  Gregory can set the machine to function automatically  You stand where he shows you  press the button he shows you  and fifteen seconds later it ll take you forward in time five seconds and about a kilometer in space  to The Guide s office  He ll be at his desk now  You ll have forty-five seconds to do the job  from the time the field collapses around you till it rebuilds  Then you ll be taken back to your own time again  The whole thing s automatic Can do 
How do I kill him 
I m getting sick!
Take care of her  Samuel  Both of you d better get out of here 
The Lord of Hosts is my strength  He will     Uggggh!
Conditioning s getting him  too; we gotta be quick 
This is what you ll use it  and get it out of your hand fast    bomb; everything within two-meter circle burned to nothing; outside that  great but not unendurable heat  Shut your eyes when you throw it  Flash almost blinding Walter Peculiar sort of thing for a non-violent people to manufacture 
them  in Walter s iron mines Where do I stand  now 
Right over here 
circle and stand perfectly still while the field builds up and collapses  Face that way Put that horrid thing out of sight!
thing     is what you want to use field re-builds He has no guards  He lives absolutely alone  We told you    
you re sending me forward  What do you do about the fact that a time-jump seems to make me pass out Here  Before you press the button  swallow it 
Well  I guess that s all there is 
I hope    
Conditioning got him  Getting me  too 
Hurry up  man!
Joe! You no shoot  me no shoot!Captain Benson  We were warned to be on watch for your patrol 
Any of the rest of you lads get out 
couple of them  Some are locals and don t speak very good English  I ve got to get back to Division  myself; what s the best way don t mind going slowly  they ll show you the way to advance dressing station  and you can hitch a ride on an ambulance from there Hey  Joe! Hey  Joe!

on my way back from my last hunter patrol     I ve never told anybody about this  before some honeys picked that thing up in some other way  deliberately forgotten the circumstances  and fabricated this story about the tank and the grenade and the discrepancy in your watch subconsciously as an explanation My subconscious is a better liar than that

marks  and if it were Soviet  it d be tri-lingual  Russian  Hindi and Chinese having some of the nastiest dreams  lately    Well  be careful; it may be booby-trapped 
Don t worry; I will 
There s a lot of this stuff I don t dig 
rigamarole about The Guide  I m going to get to work on this sample in the lab  at school  though  Maybe we have something  here We do have something  Bill 
to give our income-tax experts headaches You have 
Where do you start fitting me into it 
people  You re a psychologist  A real one; not one of these night-school boys  A juvenile psychologist  too  And what age-group spends the most money in this country for soft-drinks Not a bit of difference  Fred 
We have it!
Hey!
that thing  I never heard you play as well as that!I don t know 
much money practicing as a psychiatrist  these days  The whole world seems to be going pure  unadulterated nuts! That affair in Munich  for instance Yes 
Germany  too    Bill! You remember those sheets of onion-skin in that envelope 
that     Fred! heightened psycho-physiological effects   that we were never able to understand!mass-hysteria--that baseball-game riot in Baltimore; the time everybody started tearing off each others  clothes in Milwaukee; the sex-orgy in New Orleans  And the sharp uptrend in individual psycho-neurotic and psychotic behavior  All in connection with music  too  and all after Evri-Flave got on the market We ll have to stop it; pull Evri-Flave off the market 
can t be responsible for letting this go on hands of jobbers and distributors over whom we have no control  And we have all these contractual obligations  to buy the entire output of the companies that make the syrup for us; if we stop buying  they can sell it in competition with us  as long as they don t infringe our trade-name  And we can t prevent pirating  You know how easily we were able to duplicate that sample I brought back from Turkey  Why  our legal department s kept busy all the time prosecuting unlicensed manufacturers as it is We ve got to do something  Fred!
you and I  like the old times at Eisenhower High  First  we want to be sure that Evri-Flave really is responsible  It d be a hell of a thing if we started a public panic against our own product for nothing  And then    That s how it happened  then 
result of all that Götterdämmerung music  There was a band at the baseball park in Baltimore  The New Orleans Orgy started while a local radio station was broadcasting some of this new dance-music  Look  these tone-clusters  here  have a definite sex-excitation effect  This series of six chords  which occur in some of the Wagnerian stuff; effect  a combined feeling of godlike isolation and despair  And these consecutive fifths--a sense of danger  anger  combativeness  You know  we could work out a whole range of emotional stimuli to fit the effects of Ingredient Beta    We don t want to 
Beta that will keep the flavor of the drink without the psycho-physiological effects Gave them a lot of syrup without Beta  and told them to work out cheap additives to restore the regular Evri-Flave taste; told them it was an effort to find a cheap substitute for an expensive ingredient  But look  Bill  You and I both see  for instance  that a powerful world-wide supra-national sovereignty is the only guarantee of world peace  If we could use something like this to help overcome antiquated verbal prejudices and nationalistic emotional attachments    No!
even in a cause like world peace; use a thing like this for a good  almost holy  cause now  and tomorrow we  or those who would come after us  would be using it to create a tyranny  You know what year this is  Bill Why  1984 
forty years ago  Well  that s a picture of the kind of world you d have  eventually  no matter what kind of a world you started out to make  Fred  don t ever think of using this stuff for a purpose like that  If you try it  I ll fight you with every resource I have Hey  Joe! Hey  Joe!
even trust the UN with a thing like this  It makes the H-bomb look like a stone hatchet     Well  I ll call Grant  at the plant lab  and see how his boys are coming along with the substitute; as soon as we get it  we can put out a confidential letter to all our distributors and syrup-manufacturers

No  Zarvas Pol 
 time-machine  was sabotaged So  By you 
Hradzka was not content with having enslaved a whole Solar System: he hungered to bring tyranny and serfdom to all the past and all the future as well; he wanted to be master not only of the present but of the centuries that were and were to be  as well  I never took part in politics  Zarvas Pol; I had no hand in this revolt  But I could not be party to such a crime as Hradzka contemplated when it lay within my power to prevent it time when this planet was a swirling cloud of flaming gas that  It will only take him about ten thousand years into the past  But then  when it stops  the machine will destroy itself  It may destroy Hradzka with it or he may escape  But if he does  he will be left stranded ten thousand years ago  when he can do us no harm     Zarvas Pol objected  
 apparently changing the subject  Kradzy Zago asked:  General Zarvas smiled          *       *       *       *       *  The old one smiled wanly      the soldier commented  
  General Zarvas  smile vanished   he cried in horror

so  I know about spirits; they re all around  everywhere  But I don t think I m one  At least  I ve always been like I am now  as long as I can remember  Most spirits don t seem to sense me  I can t reach most living people  either; their minds are closed to me  or they have such disgusting minds I can t bear to touch them  Children are open to me  but when they tell their parents about me  they are laughed at  or punished for lying  and then they close up against me  You re the first grown-up person I ve been able to reach for a long time Probably getting into my second childhood

go and lie down somewhere  Myra Well  I object to being drugged 
what s more  I won t submit to it Albert!
No! Stop! Stop!
all devils!Devils!  Devils! 
Myra!
She s dead!
Of course she s dead!
Then look after these other people  Doctor Vehrner first; the other man s unconscious; he ll wait No; look after the other man first 
Goddammit  you heard me!
Get a tourniquet on that man s leg  you!
told  Don t you know that a man shot in the leg with a  45 can bleed to death without half trying had Git a move on 
Go get the first-aid kit  Sergeant 
Stephen s been shot  too Yessuh!
Greyrock
trouble here  My nephew s wife just went  juramentado  with one of my pistols  shot and wounded her husband and another man  and then shot and killed herself     Yes  indeed it is  Sergeant  I wish you d send somebody over here  as soon as possible  to take charge     Oh  you will  That s good     No  it s all over  and nobody to arrest; just the formalities     Well  thank you  Sergeant     gunshot wounds 
in the leg  both with a  45 pistol  And you d better send a doctor who s qualified to write a death certificate; there was a woman killed  too     Yes  certainly; the State Police have been notified Dis ain  so bad  Cunnel 
suh the ambulance gets here  And there s whiskey and glasses on that table  over there  Better give Doctor Vehrner a drink And give Mr  Powell a drink  too  He needs one 
Oh  Popsy  are you all right 
But  oh  I was afraid I wouldn t be able to do it!My God  Dearest!
Did you make her do that 
Popsy!
afraid of me! Never be afraid of Dearest  Popsy! And don t hate me for this  It was the only thing I could do  If he d given you that injection  he could have made you tell him all about us  and then he d have been sure you were crazy  and they d have taken you away  And they treat people dreadfully at that place of his  You d have been driven really crazy before long  and then your mind would have been closed to me  so that I wouldn t have been able to get through to you  any more  What I did was the only thing I could do I don t hate you  Dearest 
you  It was a little disconcerting  though  to discover the extent of your capabilities     How did you manage it down in the snow things that weren t angels almost to distraction  I was able to get into her mind and take control of her horrible; that woman had a mind like a sewer; I still feel dirty from it! But I made her get the pistol--I knew where you kept it--and I knew how to use it  even if she didn t  Remember when we were shooting muskrats  that time  along the river chamber here dangerously close to the borderline of sanity for as long as she s been here  I think my precious nephew trumped up this ridiculous insanity complaint against me as much to discredit any testimony I might ever give about his wife s mental condition as because he wanted to get control of my estate  I also suppose that the tension she was under here  this afternoon  was too much for her  and the scheme boomeranged on its originators  Curious case of poetic justice  but I m sorry you had to be included in it  Doctor Attaboy  Popsy!
give them a chance to re-form  You know what Patton always said--Grab  em by the nose and kick  em in the pants was talking for publication I don t think you ll be needing that 
the first time my loving nephew has expressed doubts as to my sanity And see to the other gentlemen s glasses  Sergeant 
all my securities and take a paper loss  around the first of September  After October 24th  I bought them back at about twenty per cent of what I d sold them for  after he d lost his shirt plain nuts  selling all my munition shares and investing in a company that manufactured baby-food  Stephen thought that Rundstedt s Ardennes counter-offensive would put off the end of the war for another year and a half!Baby-food  eh 
No  this pair were competent liars 
liar never makes up a story out of the whole cloth; he always takes a fabric of truth and embroiders it to suit the situation happens that I am a convinced believer in spiritualism  I suppose you ll think that s a delusional belief  too Well    
survival after death  myself  but I think that people who believe in such a theory are merely misevaluating evidence  It is definitely not  in itself  a symptom of a psychotic condition Thank you  Doctor 
admit their statements about my appearing to be in conversation with some invisible or imaginary being  That s all quite true  I m convinced that I m in direct-voice communication with the spirit of a young girl who was killed by Indians in this section about a hundred and seventy-five years ago  At first  she communicated by automatic writing; later we established direct-voice communication  Well  naturally  a man in my position would dislike the label of spirit-medium; there are too many invidious associations connected with the term  But there it is  I trust both of you gentlemen will remember the ethics of your respective professions and keep this confidential Oh  brother!
and better lies are told  we tell them  don t we  Popsy Yes  and try and prove otherwise 
funeral belongings  and all of hers; when he s discharged from the hospital  I ll ship them wherever he wants them  But he won t be allowed to come back here  After this business  I m through with him Colonel attitude is most generous dear; I suppose that s the police  now The ambulance 
and a mustache  horn-rimmed glasses  a blue tie and a tan-leather bag  One of the ambulance men has red hair  and the other has a mercurochrome-stain on his left sleeve  Tell them your spirit-guide told you No  gentlemen  it is the ambulance

Mr  Melroy!
Mr  Melroy  Dr  Rives is here 
Dr  Rives 
The psychologist who s subbing for Dr  von Heydenreich 
Oh  yes  Show him in 
Right away  Mr  Melroy 
Good afternoon 
favorable account of you--as far as it went  He might have included a few more data and made it more so     Won t you sit down He probably omitted mentioning that the D  is for Doris 
Vivian Let this be a lesson 
objects  or descriptions of objects; never from verbal labels  Do you initial your first name just to see how people react when they meet you by-product  It started when I began contributing to some of the professional journals  There s still a little of what used to be called male sex-chauvinism among my colleagues  and some who would be favorably impressed with an article signed D  Warren Rives might snort in contempt at the same article signed Doris Rives Well  fortunately  Dr  von Heydenreich isn t one of those 
him  Miss Kourtakides merely told me that he d been injured and was in a hospital in Pittsburgh The Herr Doktor got shot 
BB s  in a most indelicate portion of his anatomy  He was out hunting  the last day of small-game season  and somebody mistook him for a turkey  Nothing really serious  but he s face down in bed  cursing hideously in German  English  Russian  Italian and French  mainly because he s missing deer hunting I might have known it 
lame-brain with a dangerous mechanism     I suppose he briefed you on what I want done  here intelligence tests  or aptitude tests  or something of the sort  to some of your employees  I m not really one of these so-called industrial anthropologists years  has been for public-welfare organizations  with subnormal persons  I told him that  and he said that was why he selected me  He said one other thing  He said   I used to think Melroy had an obsession about fools; well  after stopping this load of shot  I m beginning to think it s a good subject to be obsessed about  exact  I m afraid of fools  and the chance that I have one working for me  here  affects me like having a cobra crawling around my bedroom in the dark  I want you to locate any who might be in a gang of new men I ve had to hire  so that I can get rid of them And just how do you define the term  fool   Mr  Melroy 
Democrats  and vice versa consequences  People who pepper distinguished Austrian psychologists in the pants-seat with turkey-shot  for a starter  Or people who push buttons to see what ll happen  or turn valves and twiddle with dial-knobs because they have nothing else to do with their hands  Or shoot insulators off power lines to see if they can hit them  People who don t know it s loaded  People who think warning signs are purely ornamental  People who play practical jokes  People who--cocktail into an electric heater  She didn t want to drink it  and she thought it would just go up in steam  The result was slightly spectacular lead-ladle  if there s one around  Well  on a statistical basis  I d judge that I have three or four such dud rounds among this new gang I ve hired  I want you to put the finger on them  so I can bounce them before they blow the whole plant up  which could happen quite easily That 
Ordinary intelligence-testing won t be enough  The woman I was speaking of has an I Q  well inside the meaning of normal intelligence  She just doesn t use it Sure 
years ago  The intelligence test is based on the new French Sûreté test for mentally deficient criminals  Then there s a memory test  and tests for judgment and discrimination  semantic reactions  temperamental and emotional makeup  and general mental attitude this Sûreté test  And this memory test is a honey-- One hen  two ducks  three squawking geese  four corpulent porpoises  five Limerick oysters  six pairs of Don Alfonso tweezers      I d like to see some of these memory-course boys trying to make visual images of six pairs of Don Alfonso tweezers  And I m going to make a copy of this word-association list  It s really a semantic reaction test; Korzybski would have loved it  And  of course  our old friend  the Rorschach Ink-Blots  I ve always harbored the impious suspicion that you can prove almost anything you want to with that  But these question-suggestions for personal interview are really crafty  Did Heydenreich get them up himself portion of the test  and big cards to summarize each subject on  And we have a disk-recorder to use in the oral tests  There ll have to be a pretty complete record of each test  in case--Come on in  Sid 
foreman  Sid Keating  Sid  Dr  Rives  the new dimwit detector  Sid s in direct charge of personnel together quite a bit Glad to know you  doctor 
Scott  you re really going through with this  then 
afraid we ll have trouble  then Look  Sid 
on the reactors  you and Ned Puryear and Joe Ricci and Steve Chalmers can t be everywhere at once  A cybernetic system will only do what it s been assembled to do  and if some quarter-wit assembles one of these things wrong--about it washed out--We have a right 
of unsound mind  deficient mentality or emotional instability  unquote  It says so right in our union contract  in nice big print Then they ll claim the tests are wrong 
I can t see how they can do that 
Neither can I  and they probably won t either 
they ll go ahead and do it  Why  Scott  they re pulling the Number One Doernberg-Giardano  tonight  By oh-eight-hundred  it ought to be cool enough to work on  Where will we hold the tests  Here We ll have to  unless we can get Dr  Rives security-cleared 
agency Indonesia in  62 and  63  and I did some work with mental fatigue cases at Tonto Basin Research Establishment in  64 If she could get into Tonto Basin  she can get in here 
I should think so  I ll call Colonel Bradshaw  the security officer 
That way  we can test them right on the job 
them in relays  I ll talk to Ben about it  and we ll work up some kind of a schedule and a dosimeter  We ll furnish them try to make you carry a pistol  too A pistol 
mean-- Yeah  A rod  Roscoe  The Equalizer  We all have to 
don t bother much with counterespionage  here  but they don t fool when it comes to countersabotage  Well  I ll get an order cut and posted  Be seeing you  doctor You think the union will make trouble about these tests 
They re sure to 
fifty of my own men  from Pittsburgh  here  but they can t work on the reactors because they don t belong to the Industrial Federation of Atomic Workers  and I can t just pay their initiation fees and union dues and get union cards for them  because admission to this union is on an annual quota basis  and this is December  and the quota s full  So I have to use them outside the reactor area  on fabrication and assembly work  And I have to hire through the union  and that s handled on a membership seniority basis  so I have to take what s thrown at me  That s why I was careful to get that clause I was quoting to Sid written into my contract    asked    Melroy replied  
 Dr  Doris Rives lifted a delicately penciled eyebrow over that  Melroy  pausing to relight his pipe  grinned at her    he asked  
itself  and every little industry was a self-contained unit  that a fool couldn t do great damage unless he inherited a throne or was placed in command of an army  and that didn t happen nearly as often as our leftist social historians would like us to think  But today  everything we depend upon is centralized  and vulnerable to blunder-damage  Even our food--remember that poisoned soft-drink horror in Chicago  in 1963; three thousand hospitalized and six hundred dead because of one man s stupid mistake at a bottling plant Sixteen hundred  How did you get here  Fly your own plane 
City hotel  on Forty-seventh Street: I had my luggage sent on there from the airport and came out on the Long Island subway half the time and have dinner together  This cafeteria  here  is a horrible place  It s run by a dietitian instead of a chef  and everything s so white-enamel antiseptic that I swear I smell belladonna-icthyol ointment every time I go in the place  Wait here till I change clothes     do they think this is  anyhow  We don t hafta take none of that 
stand for this  They ain t got no right--Ben Puryear: Dr  Rives 
outside One of the roustabouts; name s Burris 
lawyer taking it got any intelligence to test  Burris seems to be the only one who s trying to make an issue out of it Well  what are they doing ganged up here 
past oh-eight-hundred; why aren t they at work radioactivity s still up around eight hundred REM s together  and start the personal interviews and oral tests as soon as they re through the written test together you--distributing forms  timing the test  seeing that there s no fudging  and collecting the forms when they re done Oh  yes; all they ll have to do is follow the printed instructions 
interview subject Right over here  doctor 
cards  and the sound-recorder  and blank sound disks Yes 
oral test; we may need them for evidence Wanta use the phone 
Union business 
Not that one; the one with the whisper mouthpiece 
private union business Mr  Crandall wants to talk to you 
Melroy here 
Crandall  executive secretary  I F A W  
Is there a recorder going on this line 
Naturally 
office routine your employ to submit to some kind of a mental test  Is that correct against his will  If anybody objects to taking these tests  he can say so  and I ll have his time made out and pay him off men want to keep their jobs they ll have to take this test Well  that s stated more or less correctly 
just put it that taking--and passing--this test is a condition of employment  My contract with your union recognizes my right to establish standards of intelligence; that s implied by my recognized right to dismiss any person of  unsound mind  deficient mentality or emotional instability   Psychological testing is the only means of determining whether or not a person is classifiable in those terms say  mentally deficient  you intend dismissing him With the customary two weeks  severance-pay  yes 
to insist on reviewing the grounds for dismissal review being reserved by the union in such cases  Only in cases of disciplinary dismissal  which this is not  I take the position that certain minimum standards of intelligence and mental stability are essentials in this sort of work  just as  say  certain minimum standards of literacy are essential in clerical work are will be dropped from my payroll passed these tests You 
tests are being given  and will be evaluated  by a graduate psychologist  Dr  D  Warren Rives  who has a diploma from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and is a member of the American Psychological Association  Dr  Rives will be the final arbiter on who is or is not disqualified by these tests Well  our man Koffler says you have some girl there to give the tests 
I suppose he means Dr  Rives 
is an extremely competent psychologist  however  She came to me most highly recommended by Dr  Karl von Heydenreich  who is not inclined to be careless with his recommendations to have dismissals which occur as a result of these tests signed with me  Get a qualified lawyer to tell you what we ve agreed to and what we haven t  Was there anything else you wanted to talk about     No     Then good morning  Mr  Crandall All right; let s get on with it 
them into the lunch room; there are enough tables and benches in there for everybody to take the written test in two relays The union s gotta be represented while these tests is going on 
what you do to these guys This man working for us 
Yes  Koffler  Julius  Electrical fitter; Joe Ricci s gang 
written test  and gets first turn for the orals  That way he can spend the rest of his time on duty here for the union  and will know in advance what the test is like this  You keep your mouth out of it  If you see anything that looks objectionable  make a note of it  but don t try to interfere tanks  and a couple of thousand soldiers and cops and undercover-men  here  guarding against sabotage  Don t you realize that a workman who makes stupid or careless or impulsive mistakes is just as dangerous to the plant as any saboteur  If somebody shoots you through the head  it doesn t matter whether he planned to murder you for a year or just didn t know the gun was loaded; you re as dead one way as the other  I should think you d thank me for trying to eliminate a serious source of danger Now  don t misunderstand my position  Mr  Melroy 
people are going to make trouble cybernetic system for you; you aren t responsible for my labor policy yourself Have I had--!
personnel  here; that makes me his top-priority target  all the time the I F A W   my lawyer and their lawyer handled everything; I never even met him Well--He has his job to do  the same as I have 
does it conscientiously  But it s like this--anything a workman tells him is the truth  and anything an employer tells him is a dirty lie  Until proven differently  of course  but that takes a lot of doing  And he goes off half-cocked a lot of times  He doesn t stop to analyze situations very closely control over my labor relations  Tell him to bring his gripes to me tests and interviews completed results  though  I wonder if there s a vacant desk around here  anywhere  and a record player And if you re going to be working late  I ll order some dinner for you from the cafeteria  I m going to be here all evening  myself I don t think they got everything out of that reactor 
REM s--and the temperature s away up  too  That isn t lingering radiation; that s prompt radiation Radioactivity hasn t dropped since morning; I d think so  too 
What are they getting on the breakdown counter 
maintenance boss; he doesn t like it  either Well  I m no nuclear physicist 
stuff looks like a big chunk of Pu-239 left inside  What s Fred doing about it remote-control equipment  When I left  he had a gang pulling out graphite blocks with RC-tongs  We probably won t get a chance to work on it much before thirteen-hundred tomorrow still have this stuff to get straightened out  too three dinners  Dr  Rives is eating here  too  Find out what she wants; I want pork chops Uh-huh; Li l Abner Melroy; po k chops unless otherwise specified 
How d the finished tests come out 
Better than I d expected  Only two washouts 
Burris and Julius Koffler Oh   no !
loudest-mouthed I-know-my-rights boy on the job!Well  wasn t that to be expected 
those two put on--ability and judgment problem-child show-off type  and Burris is an almost perfect twelve-year-old schoolyard bully  They both have inferiority complexes long enough to step on  If the purpose of this test is what I m led to believe it is  I can t  in professional good conscience  recommend anything but that you get rid of both of them the best show of plausibility  that the test is just a pretext to fire them for union activities they re the only ones they ll have company No  I can t do that 
the test was solely for ability to reason logically  Just among the three of us  I know some university professors who d flunk on that  But if the rest of the tests show stability  sense of responsibility  good judgment  and a tendency to think before acting  the subject can be classified as a safe and reliable workman finished No!
chance they may do something disastrous  I ll fire them at oh-eight-hundred tomorrow All right 
didn t warn you They re here at my office 
them  and hear recordings of the oral portions of the tests  But I d advise you to bring a professional psychologist along  because unless you re a trained psychologist yourself  they re not likely to mean much to you Oh  sure!
ordinary people  or you couldn t get away with this frame-up! Well  don t worry  I ll be along to see them I F A W  Well  frankly  so am I 
play Hatfields and McCoys with this union  I ve had union trouble before  and it isn t fun  You re the gentleman who called me last evening  aren t you  Then you understand my position in the matter officer  last evening  He agrees that a stupid or careless workman is  under some circumstances  a more serious threat to security than any saboteur  And we realize fully how dangerous those Doernberg-Giardanos are  and how much more dangerous they d be if these cybernetic controls were improperly assembled  But this man Crandall is talking about calling a strike Atomic Power Authority  And  in the second place  if he does and it goes to Federal mediation  his demand for the reinstatement of those men will be thrown out  and his own organization will have to disavow his action  because he ll be calling the strike against his own contract Well  I hope so 
I wish you luck; you re going to need it 
Mr  Melroy  we re not going to stand for this 
getting rid of Mr  Koffler and Mr  Burris because of their legitimate union activities Who gave you that idea 
Koffler and Burris 
That s the complaint they made to me  and it s borne out by the facts 
that Mr  Koffler has made to us about different unfair work-assignments  improper working conditions  inequities in allotting overtime work  and other infractions of union-shop conditions  on behalf of Mr  Burris  So you decided to get rid of both of them  and you think you can use this clause in our contract with your company about persons of deficient intelligence  The fact is  you re known to have threatened on several occasions to get rid of both of them I am 
those people tell you  Well  they lied to you if they told you that Naturally that s what you d say 
account for the fact that those two men  and only those two men  were dismissed for alleged deficient intelligence The tests aren t all made 
say that they are the only ones disqualified  And if you look over the records of the tests  you ll see where Koffler and Burris failed and the others passed  Here Burris ; these are the ones of the men who passed the test  Look them over if you want to Why  this stuff s a lot of gibberish!
thing  here:     five Limerick oysters  six pairs of Don Alfonso tweezers  seven hundred Macedonian warriors in full battle array  eight golden crowns from the ancient  secret crypts of Egypt  nine lymphatic  sympathetic  peripatetic old men on crutches  and ten revolving heliotropes from the Ipsy-Wipsy Institute!  Great Lord  do you actually mean that you re using this stuff as an excuse for depriving men of their jobs along Burris to repeat their complaints on a lie-detector  while you re at it  They took the same tests  in the same manner  as any of the others  They just didn t have the mental equipment to cope with them and the others did  And for that reason  I won t run the risk of having them working on this job That s just your word against theirs 
them morning That s not the way they tell it 
Keating have been out to get them ever since they were hired  You and your supervisors have been persecuting both of those men systematically  The fact that Burris has had grounds for all these previous complaints proves that credulous enough to believe him confirm the results of the tests they failed to pass he has a persecution complex if he recognizes the fact  Well  you re not going to get away with it  that s all I have to say to you not worth the paper it s scribbled on!They walked out on us 
talking to them  and at noon the whole gang handed in their wrist-Geigers and dosimeters and cleared out their lockers  They say they aren t coming back till Burris and Koffler come back to work with them Then they aren t coming back  period 
see me  a couple of hours ago  He tells me that Burris and Koffler told him that we ve been persecuting Burris; discriminating against him  You know of anything that really happened that might make them think anything like that but you know how it is: he s just a roustabout  a common laborer  Any overtime work that has to be done is usually skilled labor on this job  We generally have a few roustabouts to help out  but he s been allowed to make overtime as much as any of the others Will the time-records show that 
whatever it was  I ll bet they were lying That s all right  then  How s the reactor  now 
down to inactive normal  He and his gang found a big chunk of plutonium  about one-quarter CM  inside  He got it out completed test records and come out to the office  You and the others stay on the job; we may have some men for you by this afternoon; tomorrow morning certainly Joan  is Sid Keating out there  Send him in  will you 
All right  Cassandra 
didn t warn me  Look  This strike is illegal  It s a violation of the Federal Labor Act of 1958  being called without due notice of intention  without preliminary negotiation  and without two weeks  time-allowance a  spontaneous work-stoppage  every one of those men for leaving their work without permission and absence from duty without leave  How many of our own men  from Pittsburgh  do we have working in these machine shops and in the assembly shop here  About sixty are you this work better than this gang we ve had to hire here  Just to be on the safe side  I m promoting all of them  as of oh-eight-hundred this morning  to assistant gang-foremen  on salaries  That ll take them outside union jurisdiction But how about our contract with the I F A W  
execution of our contract with the Atomic Power Authority  You know what I think  I think the I F A W  front office is going to have to disavow this  It ll hurt them to do it  but they ll have to  Crandall s put them in the middle on this How about security clearance for our own men 
Nothing to that 
already  from the work we did installing that counter-rocket control system on the U S S   Alaska   and the work we did on that symbolic-logic computer for the Philadelphia Project  It may take all day to get the red tape unwound  but I think we can be ready to start by oh-eight-hundred tomorrow Melroy  what are you trying to do 
shot-stung bobcat  They claim you re going to bring in strike-breakers; they re talking about picketing the whole reactor area News gets around fast  here  doesn t it 
that would mean the whole thing will go to mediation and get aired  which is what I want  or they ll pull a Pearl Harbor on you  the way they did on me  And in that case  the President will have to intervene  and they ll fly in technicians from some of the Armed Forces plants to keep this place running  And in that case  things ll get settled that much quicker  This Crandall thinks these men I fired are martyrs  and he s preaching a crusade  He ought to carry an  advocatus diaboli  on his payroll  to scrutinize the qualifications of his martyrs  before he starts canonizing them I have twelve more tests completed 
Only one washout 
Doctor  they re all washed out 
there was an additional test  and they all flunked it  Evinced willingness to follow unwise leadership and allow themselves to be talked into improper courses of action  You go on in to New York  and take all the test-material  including sound records  with you  Stay at the hotel--your pay will go on--till I need you  There ll be a Federal Mediation hearing in a day or so Well  the war s on 
whole plant  at oh-eight-hundred tomorrow and five the guillotine  What s Washington doing Kennebunkport Reaction Lab; they will be here by about oh-three-hundred tomorrow  And a couple of Federal mediators are coming in to La Guardia at seventeen hundred; they re going to hold preliminary hearings at the new Federal Building on Washington Square beginning twenty hundred  A couple of I F A W  negotiators are coming in from the national union headquarters at Oak Ridge: they should be getting in about the same time  You d better be on hand  and have Dr  Rives there with you  There s a good chance this thing may get cleared up in a day or so I will undoubtedly be there  complete with Dr  Rives 
It will be a pleasure!
Scott  do you know what those--
Doernberg-Giardano; got a chain-reaction started again Who 
excuse was that it would be unsafe to leave the reactor in its dismantled condition during a prolonged shutdown--they were assuming  I suppose  that the strike would be allowed to proceed unopposed--but of course the real reason was that they wanted to get a chain-reaction started to keep our people from working on the reactor Well  didn t Hausinger try to stop them 
his shirt and that Luger on his hip for  but he said he had orders not to use force  for fear of prejudicing the mediators and get Steve and Joe  and come on out  We only work here--when we re able I was afraid I d keep you waiting 
hotel by cab  and there was a frightful jam at Fortieth Street  and another one just below Madison Square of ten--ninety-nine out of a hundred--it s the fault of some fool doing something stupid  Speaking about doing stupid things  though--I did one  Forgot to take that gun out of my overcoat pocket  and didn t notice that I had it till I was on the subway  coming in  Have a big flashlight in the other pocket  but that doesn t matter  What I m worried about is that somebody ll find out I have a gun and raise a howl about my coming armed to a mediation hearing We mustn t discuss business until the others get here 
they ll be sure to think we re trying to take an unfair advantage of them  I suppose neither of you have had time to see any of the new plays discussion  so that everybody can see what everybody else s position in the matter is  We won t bother to make a sound recording  Then  if we have managed to reach some common understanding of the question this evening  we can start the regular hearing say at thirteen hundred tomorrow  Is that agreeable the discharge  by Mr  Melroy  of two of his employees  named Koffler and Burris  Is that correct attempting to use strike-breakers  and the Long Island Atomic Power Authority s having condoned this unfair employment practice strike on my company We resent that characterization!
or declaration of intention  which this was in illegal manner  at the Long Island Reaction Plant On sixteen hours  notice 
Well  that wasn t the fault of the I F A W  as an organization 
postponed for two weeks  in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Labor Act Well  how about my company 
members walked out on me  without any notice whatever  at twelve hundred today  Am I to consider that an act of your union  or will you disavow it so that I can fire all of them for quitting without permission instructions from Harry Crandall  in re-packing the Number One Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactor at our plant  after the plutonium and the U-238 and the neutron-source containers had been removed  in order to re-initiate a chain reaction to prevent Mr  Melroy s employees from working on the reactor union sustains that action  too I hadn t known about that 
Neither had I 
When did it happen 
About sixteen hundred today 
We were on the plane from Oak Ridge  then 
nothing about that Well  are you going to take the responsibility for it  or aren t you 
Gentlemen 
once  I suggest that we confine ourselves  at the beginning  to the question of the dismissal of these men  Burris and Koffler  If we find that the I F A W  has a legitimate grievance in what we may call the Burris-Koffler question  we can settle that and then go on to these other questions I m agreeable to that 
So are we 
question  perhaps you gentlemen should state the grounds for your complaints I ll deny those statements  categorically and seriatim 
were disqualified by the tests and dropped from my payroll because of being  in the words of my contract with your union   persons of unsound mind  deficient intelligence and/or emotional instability   What happened is that your local official  Crandall  accepted everything they told him uncritically  and you accepted everything Crandall told you  in the same spirit    Melroy continued  turning to Lyons  
        *       *       *       *       *  Permission granted by Lyons  Doris Rives rose  At some length  she explained the nature and purpose of the tests  and her method of scoring and correlating them   asked    Doris Rives became angry  
 of the distinguished Austrian psychologist s name    Melroy echoed

Columbus get his ships from Henry the Seventh of England and sail under the English instead of the Spanish flag  You know  he did try to get English backing  before he went to Spain  but King Henry turned him down  That could be changed Yes  that would work 
the time  on whether or not they had a hangover  or what some court favorite thought Henry the Seventh  not Henry the Eighth  Right  We ll fix it so that Columbus will catch him when he s in a good humor What goes on 
Has somebody invented a time machine 
television program  Tell the gentleman about it We re calling it  Crossroads of Destiny  
one half-hour show a week; in each episode  we ll take some historic event and show how history could have been changed if something had happened differently  We dramatize the event up to that point just as it really happened  and then a commentary-voice comes on and announces that this is the Crossroads of Destiny; this is where history could have been completely changed  Then he gives a resumé of what really did happen  and then he says    But --suppose so and so had done this and that  instead of such and such   Then we pick up the dramatization at that point  only we show it the way it might have happened  Like this thing about Columbus; we ll show how it could have happened  and end with Columbus wading ashore with his sword in one hand and a flag in the other  just like the painting  only it ll be the English flag  and Columbus will shout:  I take possession of this new land in the name of His Majesty  Henry the Seventh of England! And then  the sailors all sing  God Save the King  
Which wasn t written till about 1745 
Huh 
Are you sure 
Henry!  or  St  George for England!  or something  Then  at the end  we introduce the program guest  some history expert  a real name  and he tells how he thinks history would have been changed if it had happened this way The crossroads will give out before long 
The sponsor ll give out first 
crossroads after another them to keep the show running for a year We have about twenty already written and ready to produce 
staff is working on now be changed Well  of course--
what really did happen  but it stands to reason if something had happened differently  the results would have been different  doesn t it run  There d be some differences at the time  but over the years wouldn t they all cancel out  Non  non  Monsieur! 
can be shange !What do you think  Professor 
they d accumulate  Say something happened a century ago  to throw a presidential election the other way  You d get different people at the head of the government  opposite lines of policy taken  and eventually we d be getting into different wars with different enemies at different times  and different batches of young men killed before they could marry and have families--different people being born or not being born  That would mean different ideas  good or bad  being advanced; different books written; different inventions  and different social and economic problems as a consequence Look  he s only giving himself a century 
the changes if this thing we were discussing  Columbus sailing under the English flag  had happened  Or suppose Leif Ericson had been able to plant a permanent colony in America in the Eleventh Century  or if the Saracens had won the Battle of Tours  Try to imagine the world today if any of those things had happened  One thing you can be sure of--any errors you make in trying to imagine such a world will be on the side of over-conservatism I don t think you realize just how good an idea you have  here 
timid and unimaginative treatment What do you mean 
changed history; you should emphasize the changes that could have been made  You re going to end this show you were talking about with a shot of Columbus wading up to the beach with an English flag  aren t you Well  that s the logical ending 
That s the logical beginning 
after that  your guest historian comes on; how much time will he be allowed short--syllable  that what we have seen didn t really happen  because if he doesn t  the next morning half the twelve-year-old kids in the country will be rushing wild-eyed into school to slip the teacher the real inside about the discovery of America  By the time he gets that done  he ll be able to mumble a couple of generalities about vast and incalculable effects  and then it ll be time to tell the public about Widgets  the really safe cigarettes  all filter and absolutely free from tobacco Gin-and-tonic 
I see what you mean 
difference it would have made where Columbus would have gotten his ships  as long as he got them and America got discovered  I can see it would have made a hell of a big difference  But how could it be handled any other way  How could you figure out just what the difference would have been need a man with a powerful creative imagination  who is used to using it inside rigorously defined limits  Don t try to get them both in one; a collaboration would really be better  Then you work from the known situation in Europe and in America in 1492  and decide on the immediate effects  And from that  you have to carry it along  step by step  down to the present  It would be a lot of hard and very exacting work  but the result would be worth it you set it up  All you have to do is make sure that nobody else would be able to prove that it wouldn t Well  how could you present that 
under the changed conditions  The plot--the reason the coward conquers his fear and becomes a hero  the obstacle to the boy marrying the girl  the reason the innocent man is being persecuted--will have to grow out of this imaginary world you ve constructed  and be impossible in our real world  As long as you stick to that  you re all right Sure  I get that 
asking them to start with an assumption they know isn t true Maybe it is  in another time-dimension 
can t prove it isn t  For that matter  you can t prove there aren t other time-dimensions Hah  that s it!
probability  That takes care of that to you Be damned if it does to me 
Well  as far as we know  we live in a four-dimensional universe 
are we going to talk about that measuring in the fourth dimension all the time  A watch You mean it s just time  But that isn t--
We know of three dimensions of space 
we also locate things in time  I wouldn t like to ride on a train or a plane if we didn t  Well  let s call the time we know  the time your watch registers  Time-A  Now  suppose the entire  infinite extent of Time-A is only an instant in another dimension of time  which we ll call Time-B  The next instant of Time-B is also the entire extent of Time-A  and the next and the next  As in Time-A  different things are happening at different instants  In one of these instants of Time-B  one of the things that s happening is that King Henry the Seventh of England is furnishing ships to Christopher Columbus zhenerally accept  een zees countree Got it!
How s this sound 
Crossroads--of-- Destiny !
for we are in a world of alternate probability  in another dimension of time; a world parallel to and coexistent with but separate from our own  in which history has been completely altered by a single momentous event Not bad; only twenty-five seconds 
off that  Yes  something like that  and at the end we ll have another thirty seconds  and we can do without the guest But zees alternate probibeelitay  in anozzer dimension 
Ees zees a concept original weet you 
Oh  no; that idea s been around for a long time 
I never heard of it before now 
Zen eet ees zhenerally accept  by zee scienteest  
Umm  no 
absolutely no evidence to support it  and scientists don t accept unsupported assumptions unless they need them to explain something  and they don t need this assumption for anything  Well  it would come in handy to make some of these reports of freak phenomena  like mysterious appearances and disappearances  or flying-object sightings  or reported falls of non-meteoric matter  theoretically respectable  Reports like that usually get the ignore-and-forget treatment  now zey exist another that look as though such other worlds  in another time-dimension  may exist  There have been whole books published by people who collect stories like that  I must say that academic science isn t very hospitable to them worlds  Zat has been known to  appen things leaking through from another time world Or leaking away to another time world 
unidentified flying objects  I d sooner believe that they came from another dimension than from another planet  But  as far as I know  nobody s seriously advanced this other-time-dimension theory to explain them explanation  or pseudo-explanation  for the program could just as easily all it  Fifth Dimension   That would lead the public  to expect something out of the normal before the show started Was that one an oddball!

Are you there  Lee 
Yes  I m here  What time is it 
asleep  I was dreaming Plenty of time  yet 
minus three hours  I just phoned the launching site for a jeep  Eugenio s been there ever since dinner; they say he s running around like a cat looking for a place to have her first litter of kittens I hope the generators don t develop any last-second bugs 
kilos of negamatter if the field collapses It ll be all right 
out years ago Not out of those generators in the rocket  They re new 
another nuclear-bomb test  as long as I lived Lee!
all  It s purely a scientific experiment this  back before 1969 this shot we re going to make  tonight  It s so much like the other ones  before--Before the Auburn Bomb 
You ve been thinking about that  lately  haven t you 
Was that what you were dreaming of 
Oh  no  thank heaven!
I think about it  too  always  I suppose--
saw it fall  didn t you be to this shot  tonight  I was in charge of the investigation at Auburn  until we had New York and Washington and Detroit and Mobile and San Francisco to worry about  Then what had happened to Auburn wasn t important  any more  We were trying to get evidence to lay before the United Nations  We kept at it for about twelve hours after the United Nations had ceased to exist is; I probably never shall  But I know that my government did not launch that missile  During the first days after yours began coming in  I talked to people who had been in the Kremlin at the time  One had been in the presence of Klyzenko himself when the news of your bombardment arrived  He said that Klyzenko was absolutely stunned  We always believed that your government decided upon a preventive surprise attack  and picked out a town  Auburn  New York  that had been hit by one of our first retaliation missiles  and claimed that it had been hit first missile was launched  I know that to be a fact  We could never understand why you launched just that one  and no more until after ours began landing on you; why you threw away the advantage of surprise and priority of attack--Because we didn t do it  Lee!
You believe me when I tell you that 
and the people you worked with  and the people I worked with  and your government  and mine  have been guilty of  it would be a waste of breath for either of us to try to lie to the other about what happened fifteen years ago had to be launched by somebody last fifteen years the Soviet Union--not many  and they kept themselves well hidden--who were dedicated to the overthrow of the Soviet regime  They  or some of them  might have thought that the devastation of both our countries  and the obliteration of civilization in the Northern Hemisphere  would be a cheap price to pay for ending the rule of the Communist Party Could they have built an ICBM with a thermonuclear warhead in secret 
sides of the Iron Curtain  who might have thought our mutual destruction would be worth the risks involved out  they could go back to the old ways and the old traditions  Or Japan  or the Moslem States  In the end  they all went down along with us  but what criminal ever expects to fall rocket wouldn t have had to have been launched anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere  For instance  our friends here in the Argentine have been doing very well by themselves since  El Coloso del Norte  went down Doctor Richardson; Doctor Pitov! Are you ready 
Yes  ready  We re coming 
isn t a weapon project had to show an identity card the whole time I ve been here I don t believe I have an identity card 
Think of that 
Is everything checked  gentlemen 
It was this afternoon at 1730 
burning my telephone to report anything different  Are the balloons and the drone planes ready flew one of the planes over the course and made a guidance-tape; that s been duplicated and all the planes are equipped with copies How s the wind 
balloons on the job Could you spare a few minutes to talk to the press 
important; we can t explain too many times the purpose of this experiment  There is still much hostility  arising from fear that we are testing a nuclear weapon that lead pencil you re using negamatter will ever be so used  We re certainly not working on weapons design here  We started  six years ago  with the ability to produce negative protons  reverse-spin neutrons  and positrons  and the theoretical possibility of assembling them into negamatter  We have just gotten a fifty kilogramme mass of nega-iron assembled  In those six years  we had to invent all our techniques  and design all our equipment  If we d been insane enough to want to build a nuclear weapon  after what we went through up North  we could have done so from memory  and designed a better--which is to say a worse--one from memory in a few days digging a fifty foot shaft to get a rock to bash somebody s head in  when you could do the job better with the shovel you re digging with thing would be ample to construct twenty thermonuclear bombs  And that s only a small part of it Then what was the purpose of this experiment  Doctor Richardson 
structure  Long ago  it was realized that the nucleonic particles--protons  neutrons  mesons and so on--must have structure of their own  Since we started constructing negative-proton matter  we ve found out a few things about nucleonic structure  Some rather odd things  including fractions of Planck s constant negamatter atoms together  We annihilated a few of them--over there in that little concrete building  we have one of the most massive steel vaults in the world  where we do that--but we assembled millions of them for every one we annihilated  and that chunk of nega-iron inside the magnetic bottle kept growing  And when you have a piece of negamatter you don t want  you can t just throw it out on the scrap-pile  We might have rocketed it into escape velocity and let it blow up in space  away from the Moon or any of the artificial satellites  but why waste it  So we re going to have the rocket eject it  and when it falls  we can see  by our telemetered instruments  just what happens Well  won t it be annihilated by contact with atmosphere 
That s one of the things we want to find out 
about twenty percent loss from contact with atmosphere  but the mass that actually lands on the target area should be about forty kilos  It should be something of a spectacle  coming down neutrons and the positrons  Doesn t any of this sort of matter exist in nature whole galaxies composed of nothing but negamatter  There may even be isolated stars and planetary systems inside our Galaxy composed of negamatter  though I think that very improbable  But when negamatter and posimatter come into contact with one another  the result is immediate mutual annihilation eight  fifty seven -- Two seconds  one second   FIRING!
What kind of radiation are you getting 
cosmic  That shouldn t last long own dose of cosmic  and some gamma  It was the cosmic radiation that put the radios and telescreens out  That s why I insisted that the drone planes be independent of radio control Of course  there were no detectors set up in advance around Auburn 
that time  the cosmic radiation was over and we weren t getting anything but gamma What--What has Auburn to do-- 
this was the same thing you re crazy! There wasn t an atom of artificial negamatter in the world in 1969  Nobody had made any before us  We gave each other some scientific surprises  then  but nobody surprised both of us  You and I  between us  knew everything that was going on in nuclear physics in the world  And you know as well as I do--equipment around the target area  that wasn t knocked out by blast  is beginning to function again  There is an increasingly heavy gamma radiation  but no more cosmic rays  They were all prompt radiation from the annihilation; the gamma is secondary effect  Wait a moment; Captain Urquiola  of the Air Force  says that the first drone plane is about to take off Lee  were you serious 
one at Auburn down out of the sky  I wondered about that at the time--what kind of a missile would produce an effect like that  Now I know  We just launched one like it was happening in nuclear physics then  Nobody in the world knew how to assemble atoms of negamatter and build them into masses doubt if it even came from this Galaxy  But we didn t know that  then  When that negamatter meteor fell  the only thing anybody could think of was that it had been a Soviet missile  If it had hit around Leningrad or Moscow or Kharkov  who would you have blamed it on

be more happy to execute it by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the business  and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising nature  I have done my best to prepare myself  and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are Naturally 
Yes--I--
It is very difficult to begin 
Are you quite a stranger to me  sir 
Am I not 
as a young English lady  Miss Manette If you please  sir 
acquit myself of  In your reception of it  don t heed me any more than if I was a speaking machine--truly  I am not much else  I will  with your leave  relate to you  miss  the story of one of our customers Story!
our connection our customers  He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor Not of Beauvais 
gentleman was of Beauvais  Like Monsieur Manette  your father  the gentleman was of repute in Paris  I had the honour of knowing him there  Our relations were business relations  but confidential  I was at that time in our French House  and had been--oh! twenty years At that time--I may ask  at what time  sir 
I was one of the trustees  His affairs  like the affairs of many other French gentlemen and French families  were entirely in Tellson s hands  In a similar way I am  or I have been  trustee of one kind or other for scores of our customers  These are mere business relations  miss; there is no friendship in them  no particular interest  nothing like sentiment  I have passed from one to another  in the course of my business life  just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my business day; in short  I have no feelings; I am a mere machine  To go on--But this is my father s story  sir; and I begin to think
left an orphan through my mother s surviving my father only two years  it was you who brought me to England  I am almost sure it was you just now  in saying I had no feelings  and that all the relations I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations  when you reflect that I have never seen you since  No; you have been the ward of Tellson s House since  and I have been busy with the other business of Tellson s House since  Feelings! I have no time for them  no chance of them  I pass my whole life  miss  in turning an immense pecuniary Mangle regretted father  Now comes the difference  If your father had not died when he did--Don t be frightened! How you start!Pray 
business  As I was saying--and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place  though no art could trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to speak of in a whisper  across the water there; for instance  the privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king  the queen  the court  the clergy  for any tidings of him  and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have been the history of this unfortunate gentleman  the Doctor of Beauvais I entreat you to tell me more  sir 
I will  I am going to  You can bear it 
moment You speak collectedly  and you-- are  collected  That s good!
Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done  Now if this doctor s wife  though a lady of great courage and spirit  had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born--The little child was a daughter  sir 
poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born  that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of  by rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No  don t kneel! In Heaven s name why should you kneel to me!For the truth  O dear  good  compassionate sir  for the truth!
business if I am confused  Let us be clear-headed  If you could kindly mention now  for instance  what nine times ninepence are  or how many shillings in twenty guineas  it would be so encouraging  I should be so much more at my ease about your state of mind you; useful business  Miss Manette  your mother took this course with you  And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened her unavailing search for your father  she left you  at two years old  to grow to be blooming  beautiful  and happy  without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison  or wasted there through many lingering years they had was secured to your mother and to you  There has been no new discovery  of money  or of any other property; but--probable; almost a wreck  it is possible; though we will hope the best  Still  alive  Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris  and we are going there: I  to identify him if I can: you  to restore him to life  love  duty  rest  comfort I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!
there! See now  see now! The best and the worst are known to you  now  You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman  and  with a fair sea voyage  and a fair land journey  you will be soon at his dear side have been happy  yet his Ghost has never haunted me!Only one thing more 
another name; his own  long forgotten or long concealed  It would be worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to know whether he has been for years overlooked  or always designedly held prisoner  It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries  because it would be dangerous  Better not to mention the subject  anywhere or in any way  and to remove him--for a while at all events--out of France  Even I  safe as an Englishman  and even Tellson s  important as they are to French credit  avoid all naming of the matter  I carry about me  not a scrap of writing openly referring to it  This is a secret service altogether  My credentials  entries  and memoranda  are all comprehended in the one line   Recalled to Life;  which may mean anything  But what is the matter! She doesn t notice a word! Miss Manette!I really think this must be a man!
Why  look at you all!

Leave us  good boys; we have business here 
Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette

Is that well 
 I  think it is well 
Who are the few  How do you choose them

Is that all 
One Hundred and Five  North Tower 
You are not a shoemaker by trade 
learnt it here  I taught myself  I asked leave to--a long while  and I have made shoes ever since Monsieur Manette  do you remember nothing of me 
Monsieur Manette
remember nothing of this man  Look at him  Look at me  Is there no old banker  no old business  no old servant  no old time  rising in your mind  Monsieur Manette Have you recognised him  monsieur 
unquestionably seen  for a single moment  the face that I once knew so well  Hush! Let us draw further back  Hush!What is this 
You are not the gaoler s daughter 
No 
Who are you

How was it!out--she had a fear of my going  though I had none--and when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve   You will leave me them  They can never help me to escape in the body  though they may in the spirit   Those were the words I said  I remember them very well How was this -- Was it you  
us  do not speak  do not move!Hark!
Whose voice was that 
prisoner is  These are not the hands she knew  this is not the face she knew  this is not a voice she ever heard  No  no  She was--and He was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago  What is your name  my gentle angel and who my father  and how I never knew their hard  hard history  But I cannot tell you at this time  and I cannot tell you here  All that I may tell you  here and now  is  that I pray to you to touch me and to bless me  Kiss me  kiss me! O my dear  my dear!is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears  weep for it  weep for it! If you touch  in touching my hair  anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free  weep for it  weep for it! If  when I hint to you of a Home that is before us  where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service  I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate  while your poor heart pined away  weep for it  weep for it!have come here to take you from it  and that we go to England to be at peace and at rest  I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste  and of our native France so wicked to you  weep for it  weep for it! And if  when I shall tell you of my name  and of my father who is living  and of my mother who is dead  you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured father  and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all day and lain awake and wept all night  because the love of my poor mother hid his torture from me  weep for it  weep for it! Weep for her  then  and for me! Good gentlemen  thank God! I feel his sacred tears upon my face  and his sobs strike against my heart  O  see! Thank God for us  thank God!If  without disturbing him

than that; Monsieur Manette is  for all reasons  best out of France  Say  shall I hire a carriage and post-horses That s business 
and if business is to be done  I had better do it 
Then be so kind 
composed he has become  and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me now  Why should you be  If you will lock the door to secure us from interruption  I do not doubt that you will find him  when you come back  as quiet as you leave him  In any case  I will take care of him until you return  and then we will remove him straight You remember the place  my father  You remember coming up here

I was only saying my prayers

your mother s a nice woman  young Jerry  going a praying agin your father s prosperity  You ve got a dutiful mother  you have  my son  You ve got a religious mother  you have  my boy: going and flopping herself down  and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out of the mouth of her only child And what do you suppose  you conceited female 
Name the price that you put  your  prayers at!that Worth no more than that 
much  then  Whether or no  I won t be prayed agin  I tell you  I can t afford it  I m not a going to be made unlucky by  your  sneaking  If you must go flopping yourself down  flop in favour of your husband and child  and not in opposition to  em  If I had had any but a unnat ral wife  and this poor boy had had any but a unnat ral mother  I might have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck  B-u-u-ust me!another  been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry  dress yourself  my boy  and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then  and if you see any signs of more flopping  give me a call  For  I tell you in this manner  I am as rickety as a hackney-coach  I m as sleepy as laudanum  my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn t know  if it wasn t for the pain in  em  which was me and which somebody else  yet I m none the better for it in pocket; and it s my suspicion that you ve been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in pocket  and I won t put up with it  Aggerawayter  and what do you say now!You wouldn t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child  would you  Not you!--Halloa  father!Now  Aggerawayter!

Into the court 
What do you think of this 
Am I to wait in the court  sir 
Lorry  and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr  Lorry s attention  and show him where you stand  Then what you have to do  is  to remain there until he wants you Is that all  sir 
you are there I suppose they ll be trying Forgeries this morning 
Treason!
That s quartering 
Barbarous!
It is the law 
It is the law

care of your chest and voice  my good friend  and leave the law to take care of itself  I give you that advice It s the damp  sir  what settles on my chest and voice 
leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is Well  well

The Treason case 
The quartering one  eh 
Ah!

Oh! they ll find him guilty

What have  you  got to do with it  then  if a person may inquire 
Blest if I know that either

Against what side 
The prisoner s 
Mr  Jarvis Lorry  are you a clerk in Tellson s bank 
I am 
seventy-five  did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail It did 
Were there any other passengers in the mail 
Two 
Did they alight on the road in the course of the night 
They did 
Mr  Lorry  look upon the prisoner  Was he one of those two passengers 
I cannot undertake to say that he was 
Does he resemble either of these two passengers 
reserved  that I cannot undertake to say even that those two passengers were  is there anything in his bulk and stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them No 
You will not swear  Mr  Lorry  that he was not one of them 
No 
So at least you say he may have been one of them 
myself--timorous of highwaymen  and the prisoner has not a timorous air Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity  Mr  Lorry 
I certainly have seen that 
certain knowledge  before I have 
When 
prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned  and made the voyage with me At what hour did he come on board 
At a little after midnight 
at that untimely hour He happened to be the only one 
came on board in the dead of the night He was 
Were you travelling alone  Mr  Lorry  or with any companion 
With two companions  A gentleman and lady  They are here 
They are here  Had you any conversation with the prisoner 
I lay on a sofa  almost from shore to shore Miss Manette!
Miss Manette  look upon the prisoner 
Miss Manette  have you seen the prisoner before 
Yes  sir 
Where 
occasion You are the young lady just now referred to 
O! most unhappily  I am!
to you  and make no remark upon them passage across the Channel Yes  sir 
Recall it 
gentleman came on board--Do you mean the prisoner 
Yes  my Lord 
Then say the prisoner 
When the prisoner came on board  he noticed that my father 
and in a very weak state of health  My father was so reduced that I was afraid to take him out of the air  and I had made a bed for him on the deck near the cabin steps  and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of him  There were no other passengers that night  but we four  The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter my father from the wind and weather  better than I had done  I had not known how to do it well  not understanding how the wind would set when we were out of the harbour  He did it for me  He expressed great gentleness and kindness for my father s state  and I am sure he felt it  That was the manner of our beginning to speak together Let me interrupt you for a moment  Had he come on board alone 
No 
How many were with him 
Two French gentlemen 
Had they conferred together 
necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat Had any papers been handed about among them  similar to these lists 
papers Like these in shape and size 
near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp  and they spoke very low  and I did not hear what they said  and saw only that they looked at papers Now  to the prisoner s conversation  Miss Manette 
of my helpless situation--as he was kind  and good  and useful to my father  I hope harm to-day you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness  he is the only person present in that condition  Please to go on difficult nature  which might get people into trouble  and that he was therefore travelling under an assumed name  He said that this business had  within a few days  taken him to France  and might  at intervals  take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long time to come Did he say anything about America  Miss Manette  Be particular 
that  so far as he could judge  it was a wrong and foolish one on England s part  He added  in a jesting way  that perhaps George Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the Third  But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said laughingly  and to beguile the time Doctor Manette  look upon the prisoner  Have you ever seen him before 
three years and a half ago speak to his conversation with your daughter Sir  I can do neither 
either There is 
trial  or even accusation  in your native country  Doctor Manette A long imprisonment 
Were you newly released on the occasion in question 
They tell me so 
Have you no remembrance of the occasion 
time--when I employed myself  in my captivity  in making shoes  to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here  She had become familiar to me  when a gracious God restored my faculties; but  I am quite unable even to say how she had become familiar  I have no remembrance of the process You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner 
Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner 
Look well upon that gentleman  my learned friend there 
prisoner  How say you  Are they very like each other that  he  don t get no law-work to do  Don t look like the sort of one to get any  do he Don t you see she will fall!way  You will be sure to hear when the jury come in  Don t be a moment behind them  for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank  You are the quickest messenger I know  and will get to Temple Bar long before I can How is the young lady 
feels the better for being out of court like you  to be seen speaking to him publicly  you know Mr  Darnay!
will do very well  You have seen the worst of her agitation for me  with my fervent acknowledgments Yes  I could  I will  if you ask it 
I do ask it  Accept my cordial thanks 
What 
Mr  Darnay The worst 
withdrawing is in your favour Jerry! Jerry!
Here  sir! It s a fight to get back again  Here I am  sir!
it Yes  sir 
ACQUITTED 
If you had sent the message   Recalled to Life   again 
I should have known what you meant  this time 
Darnay  It was an infamous prosecution  grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses 
another man s  I believe Much better 
You think so 
and you ought to know  You are a man of business  too And as such 
this conference and order us all to our homes  Miss Lucie looks ill  Mr  Darnay has had a terrible day  we are worn out Speak for yourself  Mr  Lorry 
do yet  Speak for yourself I speak for myself 
Miss Lucie  and--Miss Lucie  do you not think I may speak for us all My father 
Shall we go home  my father 
Yes 
So  Mr  Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr  Darnay now 
business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances  you would be amused  Mr  Darnay sir  We men of business  who serve a House  are not our own masters  We have to think of the House more than ourselves  I  know   I  know 
nettled  Mr  Lorry  You are as good as another  I have no doubt: better  I dare say And indeed  sir 
know what you have to do with the matter  If you ll excuse me  as very much your elder  for saying so  I really don t know that it is your business Business! Bless you   I  have no business 
It is a pity you have not  sir 
I think so  too 
If you had 
perhaps you would attend to it 
Lord love you  no!--I shouldn t 
Well  sir!
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments  Mr  Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance  Mr  Darnay  good night  God bless you  sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life --Chair there!be a strange night to you  standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones I hardly seem yet 
again advanced on your way to another  You speak faintly I begin to think I  am  faint 
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this  or some other  Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at Darnay mended as to feel that It must be an immense satisfaction!
It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it  So we are not much alike in that particular  Indeed  I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular  you and I Now your dinner is done 
health  Mr  Darnay; why don t you give your toast What health  What toast 
swear it s there Miss Manette  then!
Miss Manette  then!
That s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark  Mr  Darnay!
Yes 
feel  Is it worth being tried for one s life  to be the object of such sympathy and compassion  Mr  Darnay that she showed she was pleased  but I suppose she was I neither want any thanks  nor merit any 
it  in the second  Mr  Darnay  let me ask you a question Willingly  and a small return for your good offices 
Do you think I particularly like you 
Really  Mr  Carton 
not asked myself the question But ask yourself the question now 
You have acted as if you do; but I don t think you do 
 I  don t think I do 
opinion of your understanding Nevertheless 
nothing in that  I hope  to prevent my calling the reckoning  and our parting without ill-blood on either side Nothing in life!
reckoning bring me another pint of this same wine  drawer  and come and wake me at ten I am drunk I think you have been drinking  Mr  Carton 
Think  You know I have been drinking 
Since I must say so  I know it 
care for no man on earth  and no man on earth cares for me Much to be regretted  You might have used your talents better 
however; you don t know what it may come to  Good night!Do you particularly like the man 
should you particularly like a man who resembles you  There is nothing in you to like; you know that  Ah  confound you! What a change you have made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man  that he shows you what you have fallen away from  and what you might have been! Change places with him  and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was  and commiserated by that agitated face as he was  Come on  and have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow Ten o clock  sir 
ten o clock  sir 
 What s  the matter 
Ten o clock  sir 
What do you mean  Ten o clock at night 
Yes  sir  Your honour told me to call you 
Oh! I remember  Very well  very well 
You are a little late  Memory 
About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later 
You have had your bottle  I perceive  Sydney 
seeing him dine--it s all one!identification  How did you come by it  When did it strike you been much the same sort of fellow  if I had had any luck You and your luck  Sydney! Get to work  get to work 
Now I am ready!
Not much boiling down to be done to-night  Memory 
How much 
Only two sets of them 
Give me the worst first 
There they are  Sydney  Fire away!
And now we have done  Sydney  fill a bumper of punch 
to-day  Every question told I always am sound; am I not 
it and smooth it again The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School 
old seesaw Sydney  Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and now in despondency!Ah!
luck  Even then  I did exercises for other boys  and seldom did my own And why not 
God knows  It was my way  I suppose 
Carton 
is  and always was  a lame way  You summon no energy and purpose  Look at me Oh  botheration!
don t  you  be moral!
How have I done what I have done 
do your while to apostrophise me  or the air  about it; what you want to do  you do  You were always in the front rank  and I was always behind I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there  was I 
I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were 
Before Shrewsbury  and at Shrewsbury  and ever since Shrewsbury 
mine  Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris  picking up French  and French law  and other French crumbs that we didn t get much good of  you were always somewhere  and I was always nowhere And whose fault was that 
driving and riving and shouldering and passing  to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose  It s a gloomy thing  however  to talk about one s own past  with the day breaking  Turn me in some other direction before I go Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness 
Are you turned in a pleasant direction 
Pretty witness 
enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who s your pretty witness The picturesque doctor s daughter  Miss Manette 
 She  pretty 
Is she not 
No 
Why  man alive  she was the admiration of the whole Court!
of beauty  She was a golden-haired doll!Do you know  Sydney 
thought  at the time  that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll  and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll yard or two of a man s nose  he can see it without a perspective-glass  I pledge you  but I deny the beauty  And now I ll have no more drink; I ll get to bed Doctor Manette at home 
Miss Lucie at home 
Miss Pross at home 
As I am at home myself 
I ll go upstairs 
I wonder 
that reminder of his sufferings about him!And why wonder at that 
I should have thought--
Pooh! You d have thought!
How do you do 
I am pretty well  I thank you 
are you Nothing to boast of 
Indeed 
Ah! indeed!

 I  began it  Miss Pross 
Didn t you  Who brought her father to life 
Oh! If  that  was beginning it--
enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette  except that he is not worthy of such a daughter  which is no imputation on him  for it was not to be expected that anybody should be  under any circumstances  But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds and multitudes of people turning up after him  I could have forgiven him   to take Ladybird s affections away from me There never was  nor will be  but one man worthy of Ladybird

Do you imagine--
Never imagine anything  Have no imagination at all 
sometimes Now and then 
Do you suppose 
theory of his own  preserved through all those years  relative to the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps  even to the name of his oppressor I don t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me 
And that is-- 
That she thinks he has 
mere dull man of business  and you are a woman of business Dull 
no  Surely not  To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette  unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is  should never touch upon that question  I will not say with me  though he had business relations with me many years ago  and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached  and who is so devotedly attached to him  Believe me  Miss Pross  I don t approach the topic with you  out of curiosity  but out of zealous interest me of the whole subject Afraid

Pross  whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him  Indeed  it is this doubt and the uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence Can t be helped 
string  and he instantly changes for the worse  Better leave it alone  In short  must leave it alone  like or no like  Sometimes  he gets up in the dead of the night  and will be heard  by us overhead there  walking up and down  walking up and down  in his room  Ladybird has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down  walking up and down  in his old prison  She hurries to him  and they go on together  walking up and down  walking up and down  until he is composed  But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness  to her  and she finds it best not to hint at it to him  In silence they go walking up and down together  walking up and down together  till her love and company have brought him to himself Here they are!
and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!
jerks Pray  Doctor Manette 
the Tower it  to know that it teems with interest; little more  I  have been there  as you remember 
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it  They told me a curious thing when I was there What was that 
had been  for many years  built up and forgotten  Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates  names  complaints  and prayers  Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall  one prisoner  who seemed to have gone to execution  had cut as his last work  three letters  They were done with some very poor instrument  and hurriedly  with an unsteady hand  At first  they were read as D  I  C ; but  on being more carefully examined  the last letter was found to be G  There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials  and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been  At length  it was suggested that the letters were not initials  but the complete word  DIG  The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription  and  in the earth beneath a stone  or tile  or some fragment of paving  were found the ashes of a paper  mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag  What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read  but he had written something  and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler My father 
you are ill!
made me start  We had better go in The rain-drops are still falling  large  heavy  and few 
It comes slowly 
It comes surely 
A multitude of people  and yet a solitude!
Is it not impressive  Mr  Darnay 
sat here of an evening  until I have fancied--but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night  when all is so black and solemn--Let us shudder too  We may know what it is 
originate them  I think; they are not to be communicated  I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening  listening  until I have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-bye into our lives There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives  if that be so 
are we to divide them among us asked for it  When I have yielded myself to it  I have been alone  and then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life  and my father s I take them into mine!
stipulations  There is a great crowd bearing down upon us  Miss Manette  and I see them--by the Lightning And I hear them!

Did he run away  fellow --where is that Accursed 
Did the man run away  Dolt  when we stopped for the drag 
a person plunges into the river See to it  Gabelle  Go on!
It is you  Monseigneur! Monseigneur  a petition 
How  then! What is it  Always petitions!
Monseigneur  For the love of the great God! My husband  the forester

Well! He is quiet  Can I restore him to you 
grass Well 
Monseigneur  there are so many little heaps of poor grass 
Again  well 
want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want Again  well  Can I feed them 
that a morsel of stone or wood  with my husband s name  may be placed over him to show where he lies  Otherwise  the place will be quickly forgotten  it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady  I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass  Monseigneur  they are so many  they increase so fast  there is so much want  Monseigneur!

Manette--Is well 
delight us all  She has gone out on some household matters  but will soon be home being from home  to beg to speak to you Yes 
and speak on I have had the happiness  Doctor Manette  of being so intimate here 
on which I am about to touch may not--Is Lucie the topic 
She is 
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours  Charles Darnay Manette!I believe it  I do you justice; I believe it 
Shall I go on  sir 
Yes  go on 
I say it  how earnestly I feel it  without knowing my secret heart  and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden  Dear Doctor Manette  I love your daughter fondly  dearly  disinterestedly  devotedly  If ever there were love in the world  I love her  You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!Not that  sir! Let that be! I adjure you  do not recall that!
I ask your pardon 
I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it 
Have you spoken to Lucie 
No 
Nor written 
Never 
to be referred to your consideration for her father  Her father thanks you I know 
Manette  I who have seen you together from day to day  that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual  so touching  so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured  that it can have few parallels  even in the tenderness between a father and child  I know  Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that  mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman  there is  in her heart  towards you  all the love and reliance of infancy itself  I know that  as in her childhood she had no parent  so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character  united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her  I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life  you could hardly be invested  in her sight  with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her  I know that when she is clinging to you  the hands of baby  girl  and woman  all in one  are round your neck  I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age  sees and loves you at my age  loves her mother broken-hearted  loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration  I have known this  night and day  since I have known you in your home with this hallowed light about you  I have forborne  and forborne  as long as it was in the nature of man to do it  I have felt  and do even now feel  that to bring my love--even mine--between you  is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself  But I love her  Heaven is my witness that I love her!I believe it 
before now  I believe it But  do not believe 
that  being one day so happy as to make her my wife  I must at any time put any separation between her and you  I could or would breathe a word of what I now say  Besides that I should know it to be hopeless  I should know it to be a baseness  If I had any such possibility  even at a remote distance of years  harboured in my thoughts  and hidden in my heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not now touch this honoured hand you  driven from it by its distractions  oppressions  and miseries; like you  striving to live away from it by my own exertions  and trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes  sharing your life and home  and being faithful to you to the death  Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child  companion  and friend; but to come in aid of it  and bind her closer to you  if such a thing can be you with all my heart  and will open all my heart--or nearly so  Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you None  As yet  none 
ascertain that  with my knowledge might  mistaken or not mistaken  have that hopefulness to-morrow Do you seek any guidance from me 
in your power  if you should deem it right  to give me some Do you seek any promise from me 
I do seek that 
What is it 
understand that  even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father If that be so  do you see what  on the other hand  is involved in it 
favour  would outweigh herself and all the world  For which reason  Doctor Manette word  to save my life well as out of wide division; in the former case  they are subtle and delicate  and difficult to penetrate  My daughter Lucie is  in this one respect  such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart May I ask  sir  if you think she is--
Is sought by any other suitor 
It is what I meant to say 
occasionally  If it be at all  it can only be by one of these Or both 
a promise from me  Tell me what it is part  such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you  you will bear testimony to what I have said  and to your belief in it  I hope you may be able to think so well of me  as to urge no influence against me  I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask  The condition on which I ask it  and which you have an undoubted right to require  I will observe immediately I give the promise 
your object to be  purely and truthfully  as you have stated it  I believe your intention is to perpetuate  and not to weaken  the ties between me and my other and far dearer self  If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness  I will give her to you  If there were--Charles Darnay  if there were--new or old  against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake  She is everything to me; more to me than suffering  more to me than wrong  more to me--Well! This is idle talk You said something to me 
What was it you said to me

secret from you Stop!
should love you  you shall tell me on your marriage morning  Do you promise   It was dark when Charles Darnay left him  and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his reading-chair empty    she called to him  
 Nothing was said in answer  but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom  Passing lightly across the intermediate room  she looked in at his door and came running back frightened  crying to herself  with her blood all chilled   Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back  and tapped at his door  and softly called to him  The noise ceased at the sound of her voice  and he presently came out to her  and they walked up and down together for a long time   She came down from her bed  to look at him in his sleep that night  He slept heavily  and his tray of shoemaking tools  and his old unfinished work  were all as usual      XI  A Companion Picture   jackal;  Sydney had been working double tides that night  and the night before  and the night before that  and a good many nights in succession  making a grand clearance among Mr  Stryver s papers before the setting in of the long vacation  The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until November should come with its fogs atmospheric  and fogs legal  and bring grist to the mill again   Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application  It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition  as he now pulled his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours   his hands in his waistband  glancing round from the sofa where he lay on his back            posture    returned Sydney  busy concocting the punch  
  rejoined Stryver  laughing boastfully  
    inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch    way    returned Sydney; 
 rejoinder at him;  Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made  and laughed    said Stryver  squaring himself; 
   answered Carton  with a careless air;  He asked the question with some appearance of scorn   delivered in no very soothing tone    for the disclosure he was about to make     Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend    Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers  looking at his friend    said Mr  Stryver  
 Carton  still drinking the punch  rejoined    Carton  still drinking the punch  rejoined    said his friend Stryver  
 The prosperous patronage with which he said it  made him look twice as big as he was  and four times as offensive    pursued Stryver  
     XII  The Fellow of Delicacy   Mr  Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor s daughter  resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation  After some mental debating of the point  he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with  and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before Michaelmas Term  or in the little Christmas vacation between it and Hilary   As to the strength of his case  he had not a doubt about it  but clearly saw his way to the verdict  Argued with the jury on substantial worldly grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a plain case  and had not a weak spot in it  He called himself for the plaintiff  there was no getting over his evidence  the counsel for the defendant threw up his brief  and the jury did not even turn to consider  After trying it  Stryver  C  J   was satisfied that no plainer case could be   Accordingly  Mr  Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing  to Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too  it behoved him to present himself in Soho  and there declare his noble mind   Towards Soho  therefore  Mr  Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple  while the bloom of the Long Vacation s infancy was still upon it  Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstan s side of Temple Bar  bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement  to the jostlement of all weaker people  might have seen how safe and strong he was   His way taking him past Tellson s  and he both banking at Tellson s and knowing Mr  Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes  it entered Mr  Stryver s mind to enter the bank  and reveal to Mr  Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon  So  he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat  stumbled down the two steps  got past the two ancient cashiers  and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr  Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures  with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too  and everything under the clouds were a sum    said Mr  Stryver  
 It was Stryver s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any place  or space  He was so much too big for Tellson s  that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance  as though he squeezed them against the wall  The House itself  magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective  lowered displeased  as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat   The discreet Mr  Lorry said  in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances  of shaking hands  always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson s who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air  He shook in a self-abnegating way  as one who shook for Tellson and Co   business character    to the House afar off   desk: whereupon  although it was a large double one  there appeared to be not half desk enough for him:  visitor dubiously    repeated Stryver  drawing back  
  answered the man of business  
manner  as if he were compelled against his will to add  internally   opening his eyes wider  and taking a long breath   Mr  Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end  and bit the feather of a pen    said Stryver  staring at him  
  said Mr  Lorry  
    able to make another admission   perceptibly crestfallen       said Stryver  
shaking a forefinger at him    said Mr  Lorry  
  cried Stryver  
 Mr  Lorry glanced at the distant House  and glanced at the angry Stryver    said Stryver; 
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off    said Mr  Lorry  mildly tapping the Stryver arm  
 elbows   reddening   The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr  Stryver s blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry; Mr  Lorry s veins  methodical as their courses could usually be  were in no better state now it was his turn    said Mr  Lorry  
 Mr  Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while  and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it  which probably gave him the toothache  He broke the awkward silence by saying:       laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh  
  pursued Mr  Lorry  
  said Stryver  whistling  
  said Mr  Lorry  quickly flushing again  
      said Stryver: 
 Then Mr  Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank  causing such a concussion of air on his passage through  that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters  required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks  Those venerable and feeble persons were always seen by the public in the act of bowing  and were popularly believed  when they had bowed a customer out  still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in   The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than moral certainty  Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to swallow  he got it down  forensic forefinger at the Temple in general  when it was down   It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician  in which he found great relief  Stryver;  Accordingly  when Mr  Lorry called that night as late as ten o clock  Mr  Stryver  among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the purpose  seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning  He even showed surprise when he saw Mr  Lorry  and was altogether in an absent and preoccupied state   bootless attempts to bring him round to the question    repeated Mr  Stryver  coldly  
  said Mr  Lorry  
  returned Mr  Stryver  in the friendliest way  
  final way;    Mr  Lorry was so taken aback  that he looked quite stupidly at Mr  Stryver shouldering him towards the door  with an appearance of showering generosity  forbearance  and goodwill  on his erring head   said Stryver; 
 Mr  Lorry was out in the night  before he knew where he was  Mr  Stryver was lying back on his sofa  winking at his ceiling      XIII  The Fellow of No Delicacy   If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere  he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor Manette  He had been there often  during a whole year  and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there  When he cared to talk  he talked well; but  the cloud of caring for nothing  which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness  was very rarely pierced by the light within him   And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house  and for the senseless stones that made their pavements  Many a night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there  when wine had brought no transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there  and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief  removed beauties of architecture in spires of churches and lofty buildings  as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things  else forgotten and unattainable  into his mind  Of late  the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes  he had got up again  and haunted that neighbourhood   On a day in August  when Mr  Stryver  after notifying to his jackal that delicacy into Devonshire  and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst  of health for the sickliest  and of youth for the oldest  Sydney s feet still trod those stones  From being irresolute and purposeless  his feet became animated by an intention  and  in the working out of that intention  they took him to the Doctor s door   He was shown up-stairs  and found Lucie at her work  alone  She had never been quite at her ease with him  and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table  But  looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places  she observed a change in it        Looking gently at him again  she was surprised and saddened to see that there were tears in his eyes  There were tears in his voice too  as he answered:   He leaned an elbow on her table  and covered his eyes with his hand  The table trembled in the silence that followed   She had never seen him softened  and was much distressed  He knew her to be so  without looking at her  and said:     He unshaded his face after a little while  and spoke steadily      She was pale and trembling  He came to her relief with a fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been holden    little hesitation  and in earnest tears   He shook his head               she answered  after an agitated pause  
  He put her hand to his lips  and moved towards the door    He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be  and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away  and how much he every day kept down and perverted  that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her    he said  
   He said   said a last 
    XIV  The Honest Tradesman   To the eyes of Mr  Jeremiah Cruncher  sitting on his stool in Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him  a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented  Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day  and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions  one ever tending westward with the sun  the other ever tending eastward from the sun  both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down!  With his straw in his mouth  Mr  Cruncher sat watching the two streams  like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry  Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind  since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women  mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life  from Tellson s side of the tides to the opposite shore  Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance  Mr  Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health  And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose  that he recruited his finances  as just now observed   Time was  when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place  and mused in the sight of men  Mr  Cruncher  sitting on a stool in a public place  but not being a poet  mused as little as possible  and looked about him   It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few  and belated women few  and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs  Cruncher must have been unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward  attracted his attention  Looking that way  Mr  Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along  and that there was popular objection to this funeral  which engendered uproar    said Mr  Cruncher  turning to his offspring  
  The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance  The elder gentleman took the cry so ill  that he watched his opportunity  and smote the young gentleman on the ear    said Mr  Cruncher  surveying him  
   said Mr  Cruncher; 
 His son obeyed  and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach  in which mourning coach there was only one mourner  dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position  The position appeared by no means to please him  however  with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach  deriding him  making grimaces at him  and incessantly groaning and calling out: with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat   Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr  Cruncher; he always pricked up his senses  and became excited  when a funeral passed Tellson s  Naturally  therefore  a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly  and he asked of the first man who ran against him:    said the man  
 He asked another man   nevertheless  and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour   At length  a person better informed on the merits of the case  tumbled against him  and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly     returned his informant  
 assisted    returned the other  
 The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea  that the crowd caught it up with eagerness  and loudly repeating the suggestion to have  em out  and to pull  em out  mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop  On the crowd s opening the coach doors  the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he was so alert  and made such good use of his time  that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street  after shedding his cloak  hat  long hatband  white pocket-handkerchief  and other symbolical tears   These  the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great enjoyment  while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a crowd in those times stopped at nothing  and was a monster much dreaded  They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin out  when some brighter genius proposed instead  its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing  Practical suggestions being much needed  this suggestion  too  was received with acclamation  and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out  while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it  Among the first of these volunteers was Jerry Cruncher himself  who modestly concealed his spiky head from the observation of Tellson s  in the further corner of the mourning coach   The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in the ceremonies; but  the river being alarmingly near  and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason  the protest was faint and brief  The remodelled procession started  with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse--advised by the regular driver  who was perched beside him  under close inspection  for the purpose--and with a pieman  also attended by his cabinet minister  driving the mourning coach  A bear-leader  a popular street character of the time  was impressed as an additional ornament  before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his bear  who was black and very mangy  gave quite an Undertaking air to that part of the procession in which he walked   Thus  with beer-drinking  pipe-smoking  song-roaring  and infinite caricaturing of woe  the disorderly procession went its way  recruiting at every step  and all the shops shutting up before it  Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras  far off in the fields  It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally  accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way  and highly to its own satisfaction   The dead man disposed of  and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself  another brighter genius  or perhaps the same  conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by  as Old Bailey spies  and wreaking vengeance on them  Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives  in the realisation of this fancy  and they were roughly hustled and maltreated  The transition to the sport of window-breaking  and thence to the plundering of public-houses  was easy and natural  At last  after several hours  when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down  and some area-railings had been torn up  to arm the more belligerent spirits  a rumour got about that the Guards were coming  Before this rumour  the crowd gradually melted away  and perhaps the Guards came  and perhaps they never came  and this was the usual progress of a mob   Mr  Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports  but had remained behind in the churchyard  to confer and condole with the undertakers  The place had a soothing influence on him  He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house  and smoked it  looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot    Having smoked his pipe out  and ruminated a little longer  he turned himself about  that he might appear  before the hour of closing  on his station at Tellson s  Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver  or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss  or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man  is not so much to the purpose  as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back   Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest  and reported No job in his absence  The bank closed  the ancient clerks came out  the usual watch was set  and Mr  Cruncher and his son went home to tea   entering   The dejected Mrs  Cruncher shook her head   angry apprehension       repeated Mr  Cruncher sitting down to tea  
 Mr  Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations  but made use of them  as people not unfrequently do  to express general ironical dissatisfaction   bread-and-butter  and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer   another bite         gentleman  shaking his head;  He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs  Cruncher  and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage  With this view  he urged his son to hold her in conversation also  and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her  rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections  The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife  It was as if a professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story    said Mr  Cruncher  
 Then he began grumbling again:   This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to perform her first duty  and  whatever else she did or neglected  above all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent   Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family  until Young Jerry was ordered to bed  and his mother  laid under similar injunctions  obeyed them  Mr  Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes  and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one o clock  Towards that small and ghostly hour  he rose up from his chair  took a key out of his pocket  opened a locked cupboard  and brought forth a sack  a crowbar of convenient size  a rope and chain  and other fishing tackle of that nature  Disposing these articles about him in skilful manner  he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs  Cruncher  extinguished the light  and went out   Young Jerry  who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to bed  was not long after his father  Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room  followed down the stairs  followed down the court  followed out into the streets  He was in no uneasiness concerning his getting into the house again  for it was full of lodgers  and the door stood ajar all night   Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his father s honest calling  Young Jerry  keeping as close to house fronts  walls  and doorways  as his eyes were close to one another  held his honoured parent in view  The honoured parent steering Northward  had not gone far  when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton  and the two trudged on together   Within half an hour from the first starting  they were beyond the winking lamps  and the more than winking watchmen  and were out upon a lonely road  Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently  that if Young Jerry had been superstitious  he might have supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have  all of a sudden  split himself into two   The three went on  and Young Jerry went on  until the three stopped under a bank overhanging the road  Upon the top of the bank was a low brick wall  surmounted by an iron railing  In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road  and up a blind lane  of which the wall--there  risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side  Crouching down in a corner  peeping up the lane  the next object that Young Jerry saw  was the form of his honoured parent  pretty well defined against a watery and clouded moon  nimbly scaling an iron gate  He was soon over  and then the second fisherman got over  and then the third  They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate  and lay there a little--listening perhaps  Then  they moved away on their hands and knees   It was now Young Jerry s turn to approach the gate: which he did  holding his breath  Crouching down again in a corner there  and looking in  he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass! and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white  while the church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant  They did not creep far  before they stopped and stood upright  And then they began to fish   They fished with a spade  at first  Presently the honoured parent appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew  Whatever tools they worked with  they worked hard  until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry  that he made off  with his hair as stiff as his father s   But  his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters  not only stopped him in his running away  but lured him back again  They were still fishing perseveringly  when he peeped in at the gate for the second time; but  now they seemed to have got a bite  There was a screwing and complaining sound down below  and their bent figures were strained  as if by a weight  By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it  and came to the surface  Young Jerry very well knew what it would be; but  when he saw it  and saw his honoured parent about to wrench it open  he was so frightened  being new to the sight  that he made off again  and never stopped until he had run a mile or more   He would not have stopped then  for anything less necessary than breath  it being a spectral sort of race that he ran  and one highly desirable to get to the end of  He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him; and  pictured as hopping on behind him  bolt upright  upon its narrow end  always on the point of overtaking him and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to shun  It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too  for  while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful  he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys  fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy s Kite without tail and wings  It hid in doorways too  rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors  and drawing them up to its ears  as if it were laughing  It got into shadows on the road  and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up  All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him  so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead  And even then it would not leave him  but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair  scrambled into bed with him  and bumped down  dead and heavy  on his breast when he fell asleep   From his oppressed slumber  Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise  by the presence of his father in the family room  Something had gone wrong with him; at least  so Young Jerry inferred  from the circumstance of his holding Mrs  Cruncher by the ears  and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed    said Mr  Cruncher  
   said Jerry  
     retorted Mr  Cruncher  
 The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice  and terminated in the honest tradesman s kicking off his clay-soiled boots  and lying down at his length on the floor  After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back  with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow  his son lay down too  and fell asleep again   There was no fish for breakfast  and not much of anything else  Mr  Cruncher was out of spirits  and out of temper  and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs  Cruncher  in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace  He was brushed and washed at the usual hour  and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling   Young Jerry  walking with the stool under his arm at his father s side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street  was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night  running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer  His cunning was fresh with the day  and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London  that fine morning   at arm s length and to have the stool well between them:  Mr  Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered    hat to give his spikes free play     said Mr  Cruncher  after turning it over in his mind  
    Mr  Cruncher was soothed  but shook his head in a dubious and moral way  to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar  Mr  Cruncher added to himself:     XV  Knitting   There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge  As early as six o clock in the morning  sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within  bending over measures of wine  Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times  but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time  A sour wine  moreover  or a souring  for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy  No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but  a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark  lay hidden in the dregs of it   This had been the third morning in succession  on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge  It had begun on Monday  and here was Wednesday come  There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for  many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door  who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls  These were to the full as interested in the place  however  as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat  and from corner to corner  swallowing talk in lieu of drink  with greedy looks   Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company  the master of the wine-shop was not visible  He was not missed; for  nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him  nobody asked for him  nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat  presiding over the distribution of wine  with a bowl of battered small coins before her  as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come   A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind  were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop  as they looked in at every place  high and low  from the king s palace to the criminal s gaol  Games at cards languished  players at dominoes musingly built towers with them  drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine  Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick  and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off   Thus  Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his  until midday  It was high noontide  when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom  one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap  All adust and athirst  the two entered the wine-shop  Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine  fast spreading as they came along  which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows  Yet  no one had followed them  and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop  though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them    It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue  It elicited an answering chorus of   Upon which  every man looked at his neighbour  and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent  Except one man  who got up and went out    said Defarge aloud  addressing Madame Defarge: 
 A second man got up and went out  Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques  who doffed his blue cap to the company  and drank  In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles  and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge s counter  A third man got up and went out   Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but  he took less than was given to the stranger  as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast  He looked at no one present  and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge  who had taken up her knitting  and was at work      Out of the wine-shop into the street  out of the street into a courtyard  out of the courtyard up a steep staircase  out of the staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench  stooping forward and very busy  making shoes   No white-haired man was there now; but  the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly  And between them and the white-haired man afar off  was the one small link  that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall   Defarge closed the door carefully  and spoke in a subdued voice:   The mender of roads  blue cap in hand  wiped his swarthy forehead with it  and said    was Monsieur Defarge s not unreasonable reply  
  began the mender of roads  
 Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time  seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year   Jacques One struck in  and asked if he had ever seen the man before    Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then   finger at his nose     interrupted    said the mender of roads  with an air of mystery  
  said Defarge  
  With the aid of his indispensable cap  he represented a man with his elbows bound fast at his hips  with cords that were knotted behind him    He described it as if he were there  and it was evident that he saw it vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life    He imitated the action of a man s being impelled forward by the butt-ends of muskets    He opened his mouth as wide as he could  and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth  Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by opening it again  Defarge said   voice   Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another  The looks of all of them were dark  repressed  and revengeful  as they listened to the countryman s story; the manner of all of them  while it was secret  was authoritative too  They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed  each with his chin resting on his hand  and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three  equally intent  on one knee behind them  with his agitated hand always gliding over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing between them and the narrator  whom he had stationed in the light of the window  by turns looking from him to them  and from them to him      his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves  with a strikingly greedy air  as if he hungered for something--that was neither food nor drink;    countryman   and the craving air      said Defarge  with grim impatience  
  The mender of roads looked  through  rather than  at  the low ceiling  and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky   from the corners of his mouth to his ears   They looked at one another  as he used his blue cap to wipe his face  on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle    The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other three  and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him    After a gloomy silence  the first Jacques said   top of the stairs  and  leaving seated there  returned   The three had risen  and their heads were together when he came back to the garret    demanded Number One  
     returned Defarge  
 The hungry man repeated  in a rapturous croak  gnawing another finger    asked Jacques Two  of Defarge  
  returned Defarge  drawing himself up  
 There was a murmur of confidence and approval  and then the man who hungered  asked:   said Defarge; 
  exclaimed the hungry man  staring  
  said Defarge; 
 Nothing more was said  and the mender of roads  being found already dozing on the topmost stair  was advised to lay himself down on the pallet-bed and take some rest  He needed no persuasion  and was soon asleep   Worse quarters than Defarge s wine-shop  could easily have been found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree  Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted  his life was very new and agreeable  But  madame sat all day at her counter  so expressly unconscious of him  and so particularly determined not to perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface  that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her  For  he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim  she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out   Therefore  when Sunday came  the mender of roads was not enchanted  though he said he was  to find that madame was to accompany monsieur and himself to Versailles  It was additionally disconcerting to have madame knitting all the way there  in a public conveyance; it was additionally disconcerting yet  to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon  still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and Queen     answered Madame Defarge; 
     returned Madame Defarge  composedly  
 The man moved a little further away  as soon as he could  and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive  If he needed a King and Queen to restore him  he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for  soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach  attended by the shining Bull s Eye of their Court  a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes  the mender of roads bathed himself  so much to his temporary intoxication  that he cried Long live the King  Long live the Queen  Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time  Then  there were gardens  courtyards  terraces  fountains  green banks  more King and Queen  more Bull s Eye  more lords and ladies  more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment  During the whole of this scene  which lasted some three hours  he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company  and throughout Defarge held him by the collar  as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces   patron;  The mender of roads was now coming to himself  and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no    said Defarge  in his ear; 
  cried the mender of roads  reflectively; 
  Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client  and nodded in confirmation    said she  
      a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;     XVI  Still Knitting   Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine  while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness  and through the dust  and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside  slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis  now in his grave  listened to the whispering trees  Such ample leisure had the stone faces  now  for listening to the trees and to the fountain  that the few village scarecrows who  in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn  strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase  had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered  A rumour just lived in the village--had a faint and bare existence there  as its people had--that when the knife struck home  the faces changed  from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also  that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain  they changed again  and bore a cruel look of being avenged  which they would henceforth bear for ever  In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done  two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose  which everybody recognised  and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified  a skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute  before they all started away among the moss and leaves  like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there   Chateau and hut  stone face and dangling figure  the red stain on the stone floor  and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the night sky  concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line  So does a whole world  with all its greatnesses and littlenesses  lie in a twinkling star  And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the manner of its composition  so  sublimer intelligences may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours  every thought and act  every vice and virtue  of every responsible creature on it   The Defarges  husband and wife  came lumbering under the starlight  in their public vehicle  to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended  There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse  and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry  Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the soldiery there  and one of the police  The latter he was intimate with  and affectionately embraced   When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings  and they  having finally alighted near the Saint s boundaries  were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets  Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:    business air     been so careful to get it accurately  that he then spelt it with perfect correctness    repeated madame  
     said madame  laughing  
 They turned into the wine-shop  which was closed  for it was midnight   and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk  counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence  examined the stock  went through the entries in the book  made other entries of her own  checked the serving man in every possible way  and finally dismissed him to bed  Then she turned out the contents of the bowl of money for the second time  and began knotting them up in her handkerchief  in a chain of separate knots  for safe keeping through the night  All this while  Defarge  with his pipe in his mouth  walked up and down  complacently admiring  but never interfering; in which condition  indeed  as to the business and his domestic affairs  he walked up and down through life   The night was hot  and the shop  close shut and surrounded by so foul a neighbourhood  was ill-smelling  Monsieur Defarge s olfactory sense was by no means delicate  but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than it ever tasted  and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed  He whiffed the compound of scents away  as he put down his smoked-out pipe   money    never been so intent on the accounts  but they had had a ray or two for him     repeated madame  nodding firmly; 
 breast    repeated his wife; 
 Defarge    demanded madame  composedly  
 Defarge raised his head thoughtfully  as if there were something in that too    said madame  
   She tied a knot with flashing eyes  as if it throttled a foe    a little bent  and his hands clasped at his back  like a docile and attentive pupil before his catechist   were another enemy strangled    strong action   Then madame  with her teeth set  tied a very terrible knot indeed   cowardice;   Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out  and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene manner  and observing that it was time to go to bed   Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the wine-shop  knitting away assiduously  A rose lay beside her  and if she now and then glanced at the flower  it was with no infraction of her usual preoccupied air  There were a few customers  drinking or not drinking  standing or seated  sprinkled about  The day was very hot  and heaps of flies  who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame  fell dead at the bottom  Their decease made no impression on the other flies out promenading  who looked at them in the coolest manner  as if they themselves were elephants  or something as far removed   until they met the same fate  Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they thought as much at Court that sunny summer day   A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she felt to be a new one  She laid down her knitting  and began to pin her rose in her head-dress  before she looked at the figure   It was curious  The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose  the customers ceased talking  and began gradually to drop out of the wine-shop     She said it aloud  but added to herself  as she resumed her knitting:   Madame complied with a polite air    It was the first time it had ever been so complimented  and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better  She said  however  that the cognac was flattered  and took up her knitting  The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments  and took the opportunity of observing the place in general        fingers moved nimbly    madame  drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry   It was remarkable; but  the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge  Two men had entered separately  and had been about to order drink  when  catching sight of that novelty  they faltered  made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there  and went away  Nor  of those who had been there when this visitor entered  was there one left  They had all dropped off  The spy had kept his eyes open  but had been able to detect no sign  They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken  purposeless  accidental manner  quite natural and unimpeachable   and her eyes looked at the stranger          extra something into his name that boded him no good     returned madame  in a high voice  
 The spy  who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make  did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but  stood with an air of gossiping gallantry  leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge s little counter  and occasionally sipping his cognac     returned madame  coolly and lightly  
 that invited confidence  and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face:     As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door  the spy saluted him by touching his hat  and saying  with an engaging smile   confidence  or quite so easy a smile under the stare     said the spy  airily  but discomfited too: 
    said Defarge  shaking his head  
 Having said it  he passed behind the little counter  and stood with his hand on the back of his wife s chair  looking over that barrier at the person to whom they were both opposed  and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction   The spy  well used to his business  did not change his unconscious attitude  but drained his little glass of cognac  took a sip of fresh water  and asked for another glass of cognac  Madame Defarge poured it out for him  took to her knitting again  and hummed a little song over it   observed Defarge     pursued the spy     to him  in an accidental touch of his wife s elbow as she knitted and warbled  that he would do best to answer  but always with brevity    said the spy  
   said the spy  
    song    replied the spy  
  echoed madame  
   returned madame; 
 He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it  and turned it off with a laugh  After sipping his cognac to the end  he added:   Madame Defarge knitted steadily  but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband  Do what he would  behind the little counter  as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe  he was troubled  and his hand was not trustworthy  The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it  or to record it in his mind   Having made  at least  this one hit  whatever it might prove to be worth  and no customers coming in to help him to any other  Mr  Barsad paid for what he had drunk  and took his leave: taking occasion to say  in a genteel manner  before he departed  that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again  For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine  the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them  lest he should come back   as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair:   returned madame  lifting her eyebrows a little  
     Defarge  rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it   madame   She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words  and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head  Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone  or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its disappearance; howbeit  the Saint took courage to lounge in  very shortly afterwards  and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect   In the evening  at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned himself inside out  and sat on door-steps and window-ledges  and came to the corners of vile streets and courts  for a breath of air  Madame Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like her--such as the world will do well never to breed again  All the women knitted  They knitted worthless things; but  the mechanical work was a mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still  the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched   But  as the fingers went  the eyes went  and the thoughts  And as Madame Defarge moved on from group to group  all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with  and left behind   Her husband smoked at his door  looking after her with admiration   said he  
 Darkness closed around  and then came the ringing of church bells and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard  as the women sat knitting  knitting  Darkness encompassed them  Another darkness was closing in as surely  when the church bells  then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France  should be melted into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a wretched voice  that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty  Freedom and Life  So much was closing in about the women who sat knitting  knitting  that they their very selves were closing in around a structure yet unbuilt  where they were to sit knitting  knitting  counting dropping heads      XVII  One Night   Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in Soho  than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat under the plane-tree together  Never did the moon rise with a milder radiance over great London  than on that night when it found them still seated under the tree  and shone upon their faces through its leaves   Lucie was to be married to-morrow  She had reserved this last evening for her father  and they sat alone under the plane-tree     They had said little  though they had been there a long time  When it was yet light enough to work and read  she had neither engaged herself in her usual work  nor had she read to him  She had employed herself in both ways  at his side under the tree  many and many a time; but  this time was not quite like any other  and nothing could make it so    Even as it was  she could not command her voice   In the sad moonlight  she clasped him by the neck  and laid her face upon his breast  In the moonlight which is always sad  as the light of the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and its going    Her father answered  with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed  added  as he tenderly kissed her:    She moved her hand towards his lips  but he took it in his  and repeated the word     He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles  having seen him; and replied:   It was the first time  except at the trial  of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering  It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards   manner  as he looked at the moon   The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time  deepened as he dwelt upon it; but  there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference  He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over    She drew closer to him  and kissed his cheek and his hand          His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold  as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition      said the Doctor of Beauvais  
   He embraced her  solemnly commended her to Heaven  and humbly thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him  By-and-bye  they went into the house   There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr  Lorry; there was even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross  The marriage was to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it  by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the apocryphal invisible lodger  and they desired nothing more   Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper  They were only three at table  and Miss Pross made the third  He regretted that Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately   So  the time came for him to bid Lucie good night  and they separated  But  in the stillness of the third hour of the morning  Lucie came downstairs again  and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears  beforehand   All things  however  were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay asleep  his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow  and his hands lying quiet on the coverlet  She put her needless candle in the shadow at a distance  crept up to his bed  and put her lips to his; then  leaned over him  and looked at him   Into his handsome face  the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but  he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong  that he held the mastery of them even in his sleep  A more remarkable face in its quiet  resolute  and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant  was not to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep  that night   She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast  and put up a prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be  and as his sorrows deserved  Then  she withdrew her hand  and kissed his lips once more  and went away  So  the sunrise came  and the shadows of the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face  as softly as her lips had moved in praying for him      XVIII  Nine Days   The marriage-day was shining brightly  and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor s room  where he was speaking with Charles Darnay  They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride  Mr  Lorry  and Miss Pross--to whom the event  through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable  would have been one of absolute bliss  but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom   and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet  pretty dress;   remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross  
   said Miss Pross; 
 on occasion    Miss Pross    said Mr  Lorry  
  gentleman of that name    rejoined Miss Pross; 
  observed Mr  Lorry  beamingly adjusting his little wig  
  pursued Miss Pross  
  said Mr  Lorry  
her waist   For a moment  he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead  and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig  with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which  if such things be old-fashioned  were as old as Adam   The door of the Doctor s room opened  and he came out with Charles Darnay  He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face  But  in the composure of his manner he was unaltered  except that to the shrewd glance of Mr  Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him  like a cold wind   He gave his arm to his daughter  and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr  Lorry had hired in honour of the day  The rest followed in another carriage  and soon  in a neighbouring church  where no strange eyes looked on  Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married   Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done  some diamonds  very bright and sparkling  glanced on the bride s hand  which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr  Lorry s pockets  They returned home to breakfast  and all went well  and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker s white locks in the Paris garret  were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight  on the threshold of the door at parting   It was a hard parting  though it was not for long  But her father cheered her  and said at last  gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms   And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window  and she was gone   The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious  and the preparations having been very simple and few  the Doctor  Mr  Lorry  and Miss Pross  were left quite alone  It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall  that Mr  Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there  had struck him a poisoned blow   He had naturally repressed much  and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone  But  it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr  Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs  Mr  Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper  and the starlight ride    he whispered to Miss Pross  after anxious consideration  
 It was easier for Mr  Lorry to look in at Tellson s  than to look out of Tellson s  He was detained two hours  When he came back  he ascended the old staircase alone  having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor s rooms  he was stopped by a low sound of knocking    he said  with a start  
 Miss Pross  with a terrified face  was at his ear   cried she  wringing her hands  
 Mr  Lorry said what he could to calm her  and went himself into the Doctor s room  The bench was turned towards the light  as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before  and his head was bent down  and he was very busy    The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly  half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again   He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat  as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard  faded surface of face had come back to him  He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted   Mr  Lorry glanced at the work in his hand  and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape  He took up another that was lying by him  and asked what it was    he muttered  without looking up  
  He obeyed  in the old mechanically submissive manner  without pausing in his work    Nothing would induce him to speak more  He looked up  for an instant at a time  when he was requested to do so; but  no persuasion would extract a word from him  He worked  and worked  and worked  in silence  and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall  or on the air  The only ray of hope that Mr  Lorry could discover  was  that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked  In that  there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind   Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr  Lorry  as important above all others; the first  that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the second  that it must be kept secret from all who knew him  In conjunction with Miss Pross  he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution  by giving out that the Doctor was not well  and required a few days of complete rest  In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter  Miss Pross was to write  describing his having been called away professionally  and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand  represented to have been addressed to her by the same post   These measures  advisable to be taken in any case  Mr  Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself  If that should happen soon  he kept another course in reserve; which was  to have a certain opinion that he thought the best  on the Doctor s case   In the hope of his recovery  and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable  Mr  Lorry resolved to watch him attentively  with as little appearance as possible of doing so  He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson s for the first time in his life  and took his post by the window in the same room   He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him  since  on being pressed  he became worried  He abandoned that attempt on the first day  and resolved merely to keep himself always before him  as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen  or was falling  He remained  therefore  in his seat near the window  reading and writing  and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of  that it was a free place   Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink  and worked on  that first day  until it was too dark to see--worked on  half an hour after Mr  Lorry could not have seen  for his life  to read or write  When he put his tools aside as useless  until morning  Mr  Lorry rose and said to him:   He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner  looked up in the old manner  and repeated in the old low voice:    He made no effort to say why not  and said not a word more  But  Mr  Lorry thought he saw  as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk  with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands  that he was in some misty way asking himself  business perceived an advantage here  and determined to hold it   Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches  and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room  He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but  when he did finally lay himself down  he fell asleep  In the morning  he was up betimes  and went straight to his bench and to work   On this second day  Mr  Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name  and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them  He returned no reply  but it was evident that he heard what was said  and that he thought about it  however confusedly  This encouraged Mr  Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work  several times during the day; at those times  they quietly spoke of Lucie  and of her father then present  precisely in the usual manner  and as if there were nothing amiss  This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment  not long enough  or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr  Lorry s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener  and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him   When it fell dark again  Mr  Lorry asked him as before:   As before  he repeated    This time  Mr  Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him  and  after remaining absent for an hour  returned  In the meanwhile  the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window  and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but  on Mr  Lorry s return  he slipped away to his bench   The time went very slowly on  and Mr  Lorry s hope darkened  and his heart grew heavier again  and grew yet heavier and heavier every day  The third day came and went  the fourth  the fifth  Five days  six days  seven days  eight days  nine days   With a hope ever darkening  and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier  Mr  Lorry passed through this anxious time  The secret was well kept  and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker  whose hand had been a little out at first  was growing dreadfully skilful  and that he had never been so intent on his work  and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert  as in the dusk of the ninth evening      XIX  An Opinion   Worn out by anxious watching  Mr  Lorry fell asleep at his post  On the tenth morning of his suspense  he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night   He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted  when he had done so  whether he was not still asleep  For  going to the door of the Doctor s room and looking in  he perceived that the shoemaker s bench and tools were put aside again  and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window  He was in his usual morning dress  and his face  which Mr  Lorry could distinctly see   though still very pale  was calmly studious and attentive   Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake  Mr  Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for  did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect  and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range  that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened   It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment  the answer being obvious  If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause  how came he  Jarvis Lorry  there  How came he to have fallen asleep  in his clothes  on the sofa in Doctor Manette s consulting-room  and to be debating these points outside the Doctor s bedroom door in the early morning   Within a few minutes  Miss Pross stood whispering at his side  If he had had any particle of doubt left  her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed  and had none  He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour  and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred  If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind  Mr  Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been  in his anxiety  so anxious to obtain   Miss Pross  submitting herself to his judgment  the scheme was worked out with care  Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette  Mr  Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen  and with his usual neat leg  The Doctor was summoned in the usual way  and came to breakfast   So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr  Lorry felt to be the only safe advance  he at first supposed that his daughter s marriage had taken place yesterday  An incidental allusion  purposely thrown out  to the day of the week  and the day of the month  set him thinking and counting  and evidently made him uneasy  In all other respects  however  he was so composedly himself  that Mr  Lorry determined to have the aid he sought  And that aid was his own   Therefore  when the breakfast was done and cleared away  and he and the Doctor were left together  Mr  Lorry said  feelingly:   Glancing at his hands  which were discoloured by his late work  the Doctor looked troubled  and listened attentively  He had already glanced at his hands more than once   arm    said the Doctor  in a subdued tone  
   said the Doctor  
 Mr  Lorry saw that they understood one another  and proceeded    he paused and took a deep breath--
 The Doctor  in a low voice  asked     glancing at his hands again  
  collectedly  though in the same low voice        The Doctor grasped his hand  and murmured  the two spoke for a little while   considerate and most affectionate way  knowledge  and experience  could put me on the right track  I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected  I can do so little  Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly  and teach me how to be a little more useful I think it probable

extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady  Some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled  I think  It is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind  that those associations would be recalled--say  under certain circumstances--say  on a particular occasion  He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it Would he remember what took place in the relapse

There are two other points 
be instructed  I may go on You cannot do your friend a better service 
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge  to the conducting of experiments  to many things  Now  does he do too much singular need of occupation  That may be  in part  natural to it; in part  the result of affliction  The less it was occupied with healthy things  the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction  He may have observed himself  and made the discovery You are sure that he is not under too great a strain 
I think I am quite sure of it 
My dear Manette  if he were overworked now--
violent stress in one direction  and it needs a counterweight that he  was  overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder I do not think so  I do not think 
association would renew it  I think that  henceforth  nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it  After what has happened  and after his recovery  I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again  I trust  and I almost believe  that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted so happily recovered from will call--Blacksmith s work  Blacksmith s work  We will say  to put a case and for the sake of illustration  that he had been used  in his bad time  to work at a little forge  We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again  Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him He has always kept it by him 
Now  would it not be better that he should let it go 
You do not find it easy to advise me 
understand it to be a nice question  And yet I think--You see 
of this poor man s mind  He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation  and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain so much  by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain  and by substituting  as he became more practised  the ingenuity of the hands  for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach  Even now  when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been  and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence  the idea that he might need that old employment  and not find it  gives him a sudden sense of terror  like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child who only deals with such material objects as guineas  shillings  and bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea  If the thing were gone  my dear Manette  might not the fear go with it  In short  is it not a concession to the misgiving  to keep the forge You see  too

But  although you are the youngest man that ever lived 
I must still suggest to you--
I understand  That I am too old 
disorganised country  a city that may not be even safe for you My dear Charles 
some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away  It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with  As to its being a disorganised city  if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there  who knows the city and the business  of old  and is in Tellson s confidence  As to the uncertain travelling  the long journey  and the winter weather  if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson s  after all these years  who ought to be I wish I were going myself 
Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!
are a wise counsellor thought  which I did not mean to utter here  however  has passed through my mind often  One cannot help thinking  having had some sympathy for the miserable people  and having abandoned something to them and might have the power to persuade to some restraint  Only last night  after you had left us  when I was talking to Lucie--When you were talking to Lucie 
are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!However  I am not going 
more to the purpose that you say you are And I am  in plain reality  The truth is  my dear Charles 
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted  and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved  The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people  if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they might be  at any time  you know  for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day  or sacked to-morrow! Now  a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay  and the burying of them  or otherwise getting of them out of harm s way  is within the power  without loss of precious time  of scarcely any one but myself  if any one  And shall I hang back  when Tellson s knows this and says this--Tellson s  whose bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about the joints  Why  I am a boy  sir  to half a dozen old codgers here!How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit  Mr  Lorry 
Tut! Nonsense  sir!--And  my dear Charles 
Paris at this present time  no matter what things  is next to an impossibility  Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here  I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it  even to you   by the strangest bearers you can imagine  every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers  At another time  our parcels would come and go  as easily as in business-like Old England; but now  everything is stopped And do you really go to-night

I think  to everybody now here  and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found polished Marquis who was murdered knew him A craven who abandoned his post 
some years ago 
Infected with the new doctrines 
Marquis  abandoned the estates when he inherited them  and left them to the ruffian herd  They will recompense him now  I hope  as he deserves Hey 
fellow  Let us look at his infamous name  D--n the fellow!I know the fellow 
Do you  by Jupiter 
I am sorry for it 
Why 
times But I do ask why 
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions  Here is a fellow  who  infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known  abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale  and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him  Well  but I ll answer you  I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel  That s why You may not understand the gentleman 
I understand how to put  you  in a corner  Mr  Darnay 
understand him  You may tell him so  with my compliments  You may also tell him  from me  that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob  I wonder he is not at the head of them  But  no  gentlemen find a fellow like this fellow  trusting himself to the mercies of such precious  protégés   No  gentlemen; he ll always show  em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle  and sneak away Will you take charge of the letter 
deliver it I do 
addressed here  on the chance of our knowing where to forward it  and that it has been here some time I will do so  Do you start for Paris from here 
From here  at eight 
I will come back  to see you off 
  and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal  and shall lose my life  without your so generous help   is  they tell me  treason against the majesty of the people  in that I have acted against them for an emigrant  It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them  and not against  according to your commands  It is in vain I represent that  before the sequestration of emigrant property  I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process  The only response is  that I have acted for an emigrant  and where is that emigrant   your noble name  I supplicate you  Monsieur heretofore the Marquis  to succour and release me  My fault is  that I have been true to you  Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis  I pray you be you true to me!     The latent uneasiness in Darnay s mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter  The peril of an old servant and a good one  whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family  stared him so reproachfully in the face  that  as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do  he almost hid his face from the passersby   He knew very well  that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house  in his resentful suspicions of his uncle  and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold  he had acted imperfectly  He knew very well  that in his love for Lucie  his renunciation of his social place  though by no means new to his own mind  had been hurried and incomplete  He knew that he ought to have systematically worked it out and supervised it  and that he had meant to do it  and that it had never been done   The happiness of his own chosen English home  the necessity of being always actively employed  the swift changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast  that the events of this week annihilated the immature plans of last week  and the events of the week following made all new again; he knew very well  that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet  but still without continuous and accumulating resistance  That he had watched the times for a time of action  and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by  and the nobility were trooping from France by every highway and byway  and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction  and their very names were blotting out  was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that might impeach him for it   But  he had oppressed no man  he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues  that he had relinquished them of his own will  thrown himself on a world with no favour in it  won his own private place there  and earned his own bread  Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions  to spare the people  to give them what little there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter  and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof  for his own safety  so that it could not but appear now   This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make  that he would go to Paris   Yes  Like the mariner in the old story  the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock  and it was drawing him to itself  and he must go  Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on  faster and faster  more and more steadily  to the terrible attraction  His latent uneasiness had been  that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments  and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they  was not there  trying to do something to stay bloodshed  and assert the claims of mercy and humanity  With this uneasiness half stifled  and half reproaching him  he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison  injurious to himself  had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur  which had stung him bitterly  and those of Stryver  which above all were coarse and galling  for old reasons  Upon those  had followed Gabelle s letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner  in danger of death  to his justice  honour  and good name   His resolution was made  He must go to Paris   Yes  The Loadstone Rock was drawing him  and he must sail on  until he struck  He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger  The intention with which he had done what he had done  even although he had left it incomplete  presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it  Then  that glorious vision of doing good  which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds  arose before him  and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild   As he walked to and fro with his resolution made  he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone  Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father  always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old  should come to the knowledge of the step  as a step taken  and not in the balance of suspense and doubt  How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father  through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind  he did not discuss with himself  But  that circumstance too  had had its influence in his course   He walked to and fro  with thoughts very busy  until it was time to return to Tellson s and take leave of Mr  Lorry  As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend  but he must say nothing of his intention now   A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door  and Jerry was booted and equipped    said Charles Darnay to Mr  Lorry  
  said Mr  Lorry  
  hand          He helped Mr  Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks  and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank  into the misty air of Fleet-street  Mr  Lorry at parting  Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled  as the carriage rolled away   That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late  and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie  explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris  and showing her  at length  the reasons that he had  for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor  confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care  and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances  To both  he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety  immediately after his arrival   It was a hard day  that day of being among them  with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind  It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious  But  an affectionate glance at his wife  so happy and busy  made him resolute not to tell her what impended  he had been half moved to do it  so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid   and the day passed quickly  Early in the evening he embraced her  and her scarcely less dear namesake  pretending that he would return by-and-bye  an imaginary engagement took him out  and he had secreted a valise of clothes ready   and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets  with a heavier heart   The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself  now  and all the tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it  He left his two letters with a trusty porter  to be delivered half an hour before midnight  and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey  his sinking heart  as he left all that was dear on earth behind him  and floated away for the Loadstone Rock    The end of the second book       Book the Third--the Track of a Storm     I  In Secret   The traveller fared slowly on his way  who fared towards Paris from England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two  More than enough of bad roads  bad equipages  and bad horses  he would have encountered to delay him  though the fallen and unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory; but  the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these  Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots  with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness  who stopped all comers and goers  cross-questioned them  inspected their papers  looked for their names in lists of their own  turned them back  or sent them on  or stopped them and laid them in hold  as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and Indivisible  of Liberty  Equality  Fraternity  or Death   A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished  when Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen at Paris  Whatever might befall now  he must on to his journey s end  Not a mean village closed upon him  not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him  but he knew it to be another iron door in the series that was barred between him and England  The universal watchfulness so encompassed him  that if he had been taken in a net  or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage  he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone   This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty times in a stage  but retarded his progress twenty times in a day  by riding after him and taking him back  riding before him and stopping him by anticipation  riding with him and keeping him in charge  He had been days upon his journey in France alone  when he went to bed tired out  in a little town on the high road  still a long way from Paris   Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle s letter from his prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far  His difficulty at the guard-house in this small place had been such  that he felt his journey to have come to a crisis  And he was  therefore  as little surprised as a man could be  to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he had been remitted until morning  in the middle of the night   Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths  who sat down on the bed    said the functionary  
  of his musket    observed the timid functionary  
   cried the same scowling red-cap  
  observed the functionary  
 Darnay complied  and was taken back to the guard-house  where other patriots in rough red caps were smoking  drinking  and sleeping  by a watch-fire  Here he paid a heavy price for his escort  and hence he started with it on the wet  wet roads at three o clock in the morning   The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured cockades  armed with national muskets and sabres  who rode one on either side of him   The escorted governed his own horse  but a loose line was attached to his bridle  the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his wrist  In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement  and out upon the mire-deep roads  In this state they traversed without change  except of horses and pace  all the mire-deep leagues that lay between them and the capital   They travelled in the night  halting an hour or two after daybreak  and lying by until the twilight fell  The escort were so wretchedly clothed  that they twisted straw round their bare legs  and thatched their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off  Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended  and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk  and carrying his musket very recklessly  Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for  he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated  and of representations  confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye  that were not yet made   But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide  when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming  An ominous crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard  and many voices called out loudly   He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle  and  resuming it as his safest place  said:   furious manner through the press  hammer in hand;  The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider s bridle  at which he was evidently making   and soothingly said    repeated the farrier  swinging his hammer  
 Checking the postmaster  who was for turning his horse s head to the yard  the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on  with the line round his wrist   Darnay said  as soon as he could make his voice heard:    cried the smith  
 At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd  which another instant would have brought upon him  the postmaster turned his horse into the yard  the escort rode in close upon his horse s flanks  and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates  The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer  and the crowd groaned; but  no more was done   postmaster  when he had thanked him  and stood beside him in the yard          said the postmaster  shrugging his shoulders; 
 They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night  and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep  Among the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride unreal  not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep  After long and lonely spurring over dreary roads  they would come to a cluster of poor cottages  not steeped in darkness  but all glittering with lights  and would find the people  in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night  circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty  or all drawn up together singing a Liberty song  Happily  however  there was sleep in Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet  among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that year  diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses  and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade  and sharp reining up across their way  of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads   Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris  The barrier was closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it   in authority  who was summoned out by the guard   Naturally struck by the disagreeable word  Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen  in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him  and which he had paid for   whatever   The drunken patriot had them in his cap  and produced them  Casting his eyes over Gabelle s letter  the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise  and looked at Darnay with a close attention   He left escort and escorted without saying a word  however  and went into the guard-room; meanwhile  they sat upon their horses outside the gate  Looking about him while in this state of suspense  Charles Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and patriots  the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress into the city for peasants  carts bringing in supplies  and for similar traffic and traffickers  was easy enough  egress  even for the homeliest people  was very difficult  A numerous medley of men and women  not to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts  was waiting to issue forth; but  the previous identification was so strict  that they filtered through the barrier very slowly  Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off  that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke  while others talked together  or loitered about  The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal  both among men and women   When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour  taking note of these things  Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority  who directed the guard to open the barrier  Then he delivered to the escort  drunk and sober  a receipt for the escorted  and requested him to dismount  He did so  and the two patriots  leading his tired horse  turned and rode away without entering the city   He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room  smelling of common wine and tobacco  where certain soldiers and patriots  asleep and awake  drunk and sober  and in various neutral states between sleeping and waking  drunkenness and sobriety  were standing and lying about  The light in the guard-house  half derived from the waning oil-lamps of the night  and half from the overcast day  was in a correspondingly uncertain condition  Some registers were lying open on a desk  and an officer of a coarse  dark aspect  presided over these   paper to write on              exclaimed Darnay  
 The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment   said it with a hard smile  and went on writing    wrote until he had finished  read over to himself what he had written  sanded it  and handed it to Defarge  with the words  Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him  The prisoner obeyed  and a guard of two armed patriots attended them   guardhouse steps and turned into Paris      The word with sudden impatience    looking straight before him            Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer  and walked on in a steady and set silence  The deeper he sank into this silence  the fainter hope there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree  He  therefore  made haste to say:    Defarge doggedly rejoined  
 Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further  and his pride was touched besides  As they walked on in silence  he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the streets  The very children scarcely noticed him  A few passers turned their heads  and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise  that a man in good clothes should be going to prison  was no more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to work  In one narrow  dark  and dirty street through which they passed  an excited orator  mounted on a stool  was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people  of the king and the royal family  The few words that he caught from this man s lips  first made it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison  and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris  On the road  except at Beauvais  he had heard absolutely nothing  The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him   That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had developed themselves when he left England  he of course knew now  That perils had thickened about him fast  and might thicken faster and faster yet  he of course knew now  He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey  if he could have foreseen the events of a few days  And yet his misgivings were not so dark as  imagined by the light of this later time  they would appear  Troubled as the future was  it was the unknown future  and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope  The horrible massacre  days and nights long  which  within a few rounds of the clock  was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed garnering time of harvest  was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away  The of people  by name  The frightful deeds that were to be soon done  were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers  How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind   Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship  and in cruel separation from his wife and child  he foreshadowed the likelihood  or the certainty; but  beyond this  he dreaded nothing distinctly  With this on his mind  which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard  he arrived at the prison of La Force   A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket  to whom Defarge presented  bloated face   Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation  and withdrew  with his two fellow-patriots    The gaoler s wife  being provided with no answer to the question  merely replied  responsive to a bell she rang  echoed the sentiment  and one added  conclusion   The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison  dark and filthy  and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it  Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep  becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for!   grumbled the gaoler  looking at the written paper  
 He stuck the paper on a file  in an ill-humour  and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes  pacing to and fro in the strong arched room: sometimes  resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates    said the chief  at length taking up his keys  
 Through the dismal prison twilight  his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase  many doors clanging and locking behind them  until they came into a large  low  vaulted chamber  crowded with prisoners of both sexes  The women were seated at a long table  reading and writing  knitting  sewing  and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs  or lingering up and down the room   In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and disgrace  the new-comer recoiled from this company  But the crowning unreality of his long unreal ride  was  their all at once rising to receive him  with every refinement of manner known to the time  and with all the engaging graces and courtesies of life   So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and gloom  so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and misery through which they were seen  that Charles Darnay seemed to stand in a company of the dead  Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty  the ghost of stateliness  the ghost of elegance  the ghost of pride  the ghost of frivolity  the ghost of wit  the ghost of youth  the ghost of age  all waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore  all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there   It struck him motionless  The gaoler standing at his side  and the other gaolers moving about  who would have been well enough as to appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions  looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there--with the apparitions of the coquette  the young beauty  and the mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented  was heightened to its utmost  Surely  ghosts all  Surely  the long unreal ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!  gentleman of courtly appearance and address  coming forward   Charles Darnay roused himself  and gave the required information  in words as suitable as he could find   eyes  who moved across the room     Then he added  raising his voice  
 There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him  and many voices--among which  the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave him good wishes and encouragement  He turned at the grated door  to render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler s hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight forever   The wicket opened on a stone staircase  leading upward  When they had ascended forty steps  the prisoner of half an hour already counted them   the gaoler opened a low black door  and they passed into a solitary cell  It struck cold and damp  but was not dark        There were in the cell  a chair  a table  and a straw mattress  As the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects  and of the four walls  before going out  a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him  that this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated  both in face and person  as to look like a man who had been drowned and filled with water  When the gaoler was gone  he thought in the same wandering way  with a sick feeling  and thought   counting its measurement  and the roar of the city arose like muffled drums with a wild swell of voices added to them  paced faster  to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition  his mind  the prisoner walked faster and faster  obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it still rolled in like muffled drums  but with the wail of voices that he knew  in the swell that rose above them      II  The Grindstone   Tellson s Bank  established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris  was in a wing of a large house  approached by a courtyard and shut off from the street by a high wall and a strong gate  The house belonged to a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles  in his own cook s dress  and got across the borders  A mere beast of the chase flying from hunters  he was still in his metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur  the preparation of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question   Monseigneur gone  and the three strong men absolving themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages  by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and indivisible of Liberty  Equality  Fraternity  or Death  Monseigneur s house had been first sequestrated  and then confiscated  For  all things moved so fast  and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation  that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September  patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur s house  and had marked it with the tri-colour  and were drinking brandy in its state apartments   A place of business in London like Tellson s place of business in Paris  would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette  For  what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard  and even to a Cupid over the counter  Yet such things were  Tellson s had whitewashed the Cupid  but he was still to be seen on the ceiling  in the coolest linen  aiming  as he very often does  at money from morning to night  Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan  in Lombard-street  London  and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy  and also of a looking-glass let into the wall  and also of clerks not at all old  who danced in public on the slightest provocation  Yet  a French Tellson s could get on with these things exceedingly well  and  as long as the times held together  no man had taken fright at them  and drawn out his money   What money would be drawn out of Tellson s henceforth  and what would lie there  lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson s hiding-places  while the depositors rusted in prisons  and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellson s never to be balanced in this world  must be carried over into the next; no man could have said  that night  any more than Mr  Jarvis Lorry could  though he thought heavily of these questions  He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire  the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold   and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw  or any object in the room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror   He occupied rooms in the Bank  in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part  like strong root-ivy  It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building  but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that  All such circumstances were indifferent to him  so that he did his duty  On the opposite side of the courtyard  under a colonnade  was extensive standing--for carriages--where  indeed  some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood  Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux  and in the light of these  standing out in the open air  was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy  or other workshop  Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects  Mr  Lorry shivered  and retired to his seat by the fire  He had opened  not only the glass window  but the lattice blind outside it  and he had closed both again  and he shivered through his frame   From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate  there came the usual night hum of the city  with now and then an indescribable ring in it  weird and unearthly  as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible nature were going up to Heaven    said Mr  Lorry  clasping his hands  
 Soon afterwards  the bell at the great gate sounded  and he thought  irruption into the courtyard  as he had expected  and he heard the gate clash again  and all was quiet   The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague uneasiness respecting the Bank  which a great change would naturally awaken  with such feelings roused  It was well guarded  and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it  when his door suddenly opened  and two figures rushed in  at sight of which he fell back in amazement   Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him  and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified  that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life    cried Mr  Lorry  breathless and confused  
 With the look fixed upon him  in her paleness and wildness  she panted out in his arms  imploringly      Here  in Paris 
collect my thoughts  An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier  and sent to prison What is that noise 
Don t look!
don t touch the blind!a Bastille prisoner  There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris  In France--who  knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille  would touch me  except to overwhelm me with embraces  or carry me in triumph  My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier  and gained us news of Charles there  and brought us here  I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so --What is that noise Don t look!
dear  nor you!terrified  my love  I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place  What prison is he in La Force!
your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now  to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think  or I can say  There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out  I say this  because what I must bid you to do for Charles s sake  is the hardest thing to do of all  You must instantly be obedient  still  and quiet  You must let me put you in a room at the back here  You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes  and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay nothing else than this  I know you are true They are

surprise  yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well  or unless I could be useful; I present myself here  to beg a little talk with your brother  I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr  Barsad  I wish for your sake Mr  Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons I ll tell you 
of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls  an hour or more ago  You have a face to be remembered  and I remember faces well  Made curious by seeing you in that connection  and having a reason  to which you are no stranger  for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate  I walked in your direction  I walked into the wine-shop here  close after you  and sat near you  I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation  and the rumour openly going about among your admirers  the nature of your calling  And gradually  what I had done at random  seemed to shape itself into a purpose  Mr  Barsad What purpose 
street  Could you favour me  in confidence  with some minutes of your company--at the office of Tellson s Bank  for instance Under a threat 
Oh! Did I say that 
Then  why should I go there 
Really  Mr  Barsad  I can t say  if you can t 
Do you mean that you won t say  sir 
You apprehend me very clearly  Mr  Barsad  I won t 
Now  I told you so 
if any trouble comes of this  it s your doing 
Come  come  Mr  Barsad!
But for my great respect for your sister  I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction  Do you go with me to the Bank I ll hear what you have got to say  Yes  I ll go with you 
own street  Let me take your arm  Miss Pross  This is not a good city  at this time  for you to be out in  unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr  Barsad  I will invite him to Mr  Lorry s with us  Are we ready  Come then!Miss Pross s brother  sir 
Mr  Barsad 
Barsad 
with the name--and with the face I told you you had a remarkable face  Mr  Barsad 
Pray sit down 
Witness at that trial 
brother you have heard of relationship  I pass to worse news  Darnay has been arrested again tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours  and am about to return to him!Arrested for all that  When was it done  Mr  Barsad 
Just now  if at all 
Mr  Barsad is the best authority possible  sir 
have it from Mr  Barsad s communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine  that the arrest has taken place  He left the messengers at the gate  and saw them admitted by the porter  There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken Now  I trust 
Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow  Mr  Barsad --Yes; I believe so 
to you  I am shaken  Mr  Lorry  by Doctor Manette s not having had the power to prevent this arrest He may not have known of it beforehand 
identified he is with his son-in-law That s true 
In short 
are played for desperate stakes  Let the Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one  No man s life here is worth purchase  Any one carried home by the people to-day  may be condemned tomorrow  Now  the stake I have resolved to play for  in case of the worst  is a friend in the Conciergerie  And the friend I purpose to myself to win  is Mr  Barsad You need have good cards  sir 
brute I am; I wish you d give me a little brandy Mr  Barsad 
committees  now turnkey  now prisoner  always spy and secret informer  so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman  represents himself to his employers under a false name  That s a very good card  Mr  Barsad  now in the employ of the republican French government  was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government  the enemy of France and freedom  That s an excellent card  Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion  that Mr  Barsad  still in the pay of the aristocratic English government  is the spy of Pitt  the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom  the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find  That s a card not to be beaten  Have you followed my hand  Mr  Barsad Not to understand your play 
Committee  Look over your hand  Mr  Barsad  and see what you have  Don t hurry Look over your hand carefully  Mr  Barsad  Take time 
You scarcely seem to like your hand 
Do you play 
I think  sir 
put it to this other gentleman  so much your junior  whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of which he has spoken  I admit that  I  am a spy  and that it is considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by somebody; but this gentleman is no spy  and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one I play my Ace  Mr  Barsad 
without any scruple  in a very few minutes 
I should have hoped  gentlemen both 
that your respect for my sister--
relieving her of her brother You think not  sir 
I have thoroughly made up my mind about it 
have another good card here  not yet enumerated  That friend and fellow-Sheep  who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons; who was he French  You don t know him 
French  eh 
Well; he may be 
Is  I assure you

had that man before us at the Old Bailey Now  there you are hasty  sir 
me an advantage over you  Cly  who I will unreservedly admit  at this distance of time  was a partner of mine  has been dead several years  I attended him in his last illness  He was buried in London  at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields  His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains  but I helped to lay him in his coffin Let us be reasonable 
how mistaken you are  and what an unfounded assumption yours is  I will lay before you a certificate of Cly s burial  which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book it in your hand; it s no forgery That there Roger Cly  master 
So  you  put him in his coffin 
I did 
Who took him out of it 
What do you mean 
I mean 
I ll have my head took off  if he was ever in it I tell you 
that there coffin  Don t go and tell me that you buried Cly  It was a take in  Me and two more knows it How do you know it 
What s that to you  Ecod!
old grudge again  is it  with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen! I d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea At another time  sir 
ill-conwenient for explainin   What I stand to  is  that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin  Let him say he was  in so much as a word of one syllable  and I ll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;or I ll out and announce him 
Humph! I see one thing 
Impossible  here in raging Paris  with Suspicion filling the air  for you to outlive denunciation  when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself  who  moreover  has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again! A plot in the prisons  of the foreigner against the Republic  A strong card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play No!
with the outrageous mob  that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death  and that Cly was so ferreted up and down  that he never would have got away at all but for that sham  Though how this man knows it was a sham  is a wonder of wonders to me Never you trouble your head about this man 
that gentleman  And look here! Once more!guinea can t overstay my time  You told me you had a proposal; what is it  Now  it is of no use asking too much of me  Ask me to do anything in my office  putting my head in great extra danger  and I had better trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent  In short  I should make that choice  You talk of desperation  We are all desperate here  Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper  and I can swear my way through stone walls  and so can others  Now  what do you want with me Not very much  You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie 
I tell you once for all  there is no such thing as an escape possible 
Conciergerie I am sometimes 
You can be when you choose 
I can pass in and out when I choose 
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me  Come into the dark room here  and let us have one final word alone Jerry 
Come here 
What have you been  besides a messenger 
character My mind misgives me much 
as a blind  and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description  If you have  don t expect me to befriend you when you get back to England  If you have  don t expect me to keep your secret  Tellson s shall not be imposed upon I hope  sir 
yourself wot I ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I m grey at it  would think twice about harming of me  even if it wos so--I don t say it is  but even if it wos  And which it is to be took into account that if it wos  it wouldn t  even then  be all o  one side  There d be two sides to it  There might be medical doctors at the present hour  a picking up their guineas where a honest tradesman don t pick up his fardens--fardens! no  nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no  nor yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson s  and a cocking their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly  a going in and going out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke  if not more so  Well  that  ud be imposing  too  on Tellson s  For you cannot sarse the goose and not the gander  And here s Mrs  Cruncher  or leastways wos in the Old England times  and would be to-morrow  if cause given  a floppin  again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors  wives don t flop--catch  em at it! Or  if they flop  their floppings goes in favour of more patients  and how can you rightly have one without t other  Then  wot with undertakers  and wot with parish clerks  and wot with sextons  and wot with private watchmen  all awaricious and all in it   a man wouldn t get much by it  even if it wos so  And wot little a man did get  would never prosper with him  Mr  Lorry  He d never have no good of it; he d want all along to be out of the line  if he  could see his way out  being once in--even if it wos so Ugh!
the sight of you Now  what I would humbly offer to you  sir 
even if it wos so  which I don t say it is--
Don t prevaricate 
No  I will  not   sir 
would humbly offer to you  sir  would be this  Upon that there stool  at that there Bar  sets that there boy of mine  brought up and growed up to be a man  wot will errand you  message you  general-light-job you  till your heels is where your head is  if such should be your wishes  If it wos so  which I still don t say it is  for I will not prewaricate to you  sir   let that there boy keep his father s place  and take care of his mother; don t blow upon that boy s father--do not do it  sir--and let that father go into the line of the reg lar diggin   and make amends for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin  of  em in with a will  and with conwictions respectin  the futur  keepin  of  em safe  That  Mr  Lorry see all this here a goin  on dreadful round him  in the way of Subjects without heads  dear me  plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that  without havin  his serious thoughts of things  And these here would be mine  if it wos so  entreatin  of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now  I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep  it back That at least is true 
that I shall yet stand your friend  if you deserve it  and repent in action--not in words  I want no more words Adieu  Mr  Barsad 
arrangement thus made  you have nothing to fear from me to him  once It is all I could do 
to put this man s head under the axe  and  as he himself said  nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced  It was obviously the weakness of the position  There is no help for it But access to him

physician  originally an expert surgeon  who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris    so fortunate as to find you there  and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction  we followed  in the hope of overtaking you  Will you please to enter the carriage    the honour to seek my assistance  and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned    entered after me--the last springing in  after putting up the steps  The carriage turned about  and drove on at its former speed   emerged upon the country road  At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time  but afterwards when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue  and presently stopped at a solitary house  We all three alighted  and walked  by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed  to the door of the house  It was not opened immediately  in answer to the ringing of the bell  and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it  with his heavy riding glove  across the face   locked  and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us  and had relocked   I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber  I was conducted to this chamber straight  the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs  and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain  lying on a bed   for  in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed  had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth  and was in danger of suffocation  My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside  the embroidery in the corner caught my sight       useless I am  as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming to see  I could have come provided  As it is  time must be lost  There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place    lips  If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were poisons in themselves  I would not have administered any of those   more   the side of the bed for half an hour  with the two brothers looking on  before the elder said:   was a species of loft over a stable  There was a low plastered ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open  to the ridge of the tiled roof  and there were beams across  Hay and straw were stored in that portion of the place  fagots for firing  and a heap of apples in sand  I had to pass through that part  to get at the other  My memory is circumstantial and unshaken  I try it with these details  and I see them all  in this my cell in the Bastille  near the close of the tenth year of my captivity  as I saw them all that night    The wound was a sword-thrust  received from twenty to twenty-four hours before  but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay  He was then dying fast  As I turned my eyes to the elder brother  I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out  as if he were a wounded bird  or hare  or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature   and has fallen by my brother s sword--like a gentleman    slowly moved to me   distance  He referred to them  as if she were lying in our presence   Nobles  in the modesty and virtue of our sisters  many years  but we have had good girls among us  I know it  and have heard my father say so  She was a good girl  She was betrothed to a good young man  too: a tenant of his  We were all tenants of his--that man s who stands there  The other is his brother  the worst of a bad race    are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy  obliged to work for him without pay  obliged to grind our corn at his mill  obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops  and forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own  pillaged and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat  we ate it in fear  with the door barred and the shutters closed  that his people should not see it and take it from us--I say  we were so robbed  and hunted  and were made so poor  that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world  and that what we should most pray for  was  that our women might be barren and our miserable race die out!   poor fellow  and she married her lover  that she might tend and comfort him in our cottage--our dog-hut  as that man would call it  She had not been married many weeks  when that man s brother saw her and admired her  and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among us! He was willing enough  but my sister was good and virtuous  and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine  What did the two then  to persuade her husband to use his influence with her  to make her willing    harness us common dogs to carts  and drive us  They so harnessed him and drove him  You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their grounds all night  quieting the frogs  in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed  They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at night  and ordered him back into his harness in the day  But he was not persuaded  No! Taken out of harness one day at noon  to feed--if he could find food--he sobbed twelve times  once for every stroke of the bell  and died on her bosom    brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his brother--and what that is  will not be long unknown to you  Doctor  if it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion  for a little while  I saw her pass me on the road  When I took the tidings home  our father s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that filled it  I took my young sister  for I have another  to a place beyond the reach of this man  and where  at least  she will never be  his  vassal  Then  I tracked the brother here  and last night climbed in--a common dog  but sword in hand --Where is the loft window  It was somewhere here    dead  He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck at me with a whip  But I  though a common dog  so struck at him as to make him draw  Let him break into as many pieces as he will  the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust at me with all his skill for his life     man who was here  Turn my face to him    his right hand raised   in the days when all these things are to be answered for  I summon you and yours  to the last of your bad race  to answer for them  I mark this cross of blood upon you  as a sign that I do it  In the days when all these things are to be answered for  I summon your brother  the worst of the bad race  to answer for them separately  I mark this cross of blood upon him  as a sign that I do it    in precisely the same order of continuity  I knew that this might last for many hours  and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave   come and gone twice  and was again sitting by her  when she began to falter  I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity  and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy  and lay like the dead   elder brother  coming booted into the room from his horse   at her with some curiosity   chair with his foot near to mine  ordered the woman away  and said in a subdued voice    are always received in confidence   I was guarded in my answer  for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen   fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness  that I must abridge this narrative  There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall  and could detail  every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers   brothers she was sinking fast  and could not live another day  Until then  though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself  one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there  But when it came to that  they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too   answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her  I was alone with her  when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side  and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended      have written with this gaunt hand   night  I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it  It was the last day of the year  The letter was lying before me just completed  when I was told that a lady waited  who wished to see me           *****  life  She was in great agitation  She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St  Evremonde  I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother  with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf  and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately   her greatest desire was  to help that sister  I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister; beyond that  I knew nothing  Her inducement to come to me  relying on my confidence  had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode  Whereas  to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both           *****  could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her  and his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him  and in dread of her husband too  When I handed her down to the door  there was a child  a pretty boy from two to three years old  in her carriage   sake  Thou wilt be faithful  little Charles   The child answered her bravely   Yes!  I kissed her hand  and she took him in her arms  and went away caressing him  I never saw her more   a black dress rang at my gate  demanded to see me  and softly followed my servant  Ernest Defarge  a youth  up-stairs  When my servant came into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife  beloved of my heart! My fair young English wife!--we saw the man  who was supposed to be at the gate  standing silent behind him   house  a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind  and my arms were pinioned  The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner  and identified me with a single gesture  The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written  showed it me  burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held  and extinguished the ashes with his foot  Not a word was spoken  I was brought here  I was brought to my living grave    A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done  A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood  The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time  and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it   Little need  in presence of that tribunal and that auditory  to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public  with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession  and had kept it  biding their time  Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine  and was wrought into the fatal register  The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day  against such denunciation   And all the worse for the doomed man  that the denouncer was a well-known citizen  his own attached friend  the father of his wife  One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was  for imitations of the questionable public virtues of antiquity  and for sacrifices and self-immolations on the people s altar  Therefore when the President said  else had his own head quivered on his shoulders   that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats  and would doubtless feel a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an orphan  there was wild excitement  patriotic fervour  not a touch of human sympathy   smiling to The Vengeance   At every juryman s vote  there was a roar  Another and another  Roar and roar   Unanimously voted  At heart and by descent an Aristocrat  an enemy of the Republic  a notorious oppressor of the People  Back to the Conciergerie  and Death within four-and-twenty hours!     XI  Dusk   The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die  fell under the sentence  as if she had been mortally stricken  But  she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her  representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it  that it quickly raised her  even from that shock   The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors  the Tribunal adjourned  The quick noise and movement of the court s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased  when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband  with nothing in her face but love and consolation    There was but a gaoler left  along with two of the four men who had taken him last night  and Barsad  The people had all poured out to the show in the streets  Barsad proposed to the rest  passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place  where he  by leaning over the dock  could fold her in his arms    They were her husband s words  as he held her to his bosom      Her father had followed her  and would have fallen on his knees to both of them  but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him  crying:   Her father s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair  and wring them with a shriek of anguish    said the prisoner  
 As he was drawn away  his wife released him  and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer  and with a radiant look upon her face  in which there was even a comforting smile  As he went out at the prisoners  door  she turned  laid her head lovingly on her father s breast  tried to speak to him  and fell at his feet   Then  issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved  Sydney Carton came and took her up  Only her father and Mr  Lorry were with her  His arm trembled as it raised her  and supported her head  Yet  there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a flush of pride in it    He carried her lightly to the door  and laid her tenderly down in a coach  Her father and their old friend got into it  and he took his seat beside the driver   When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not many hours before  to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of the street her feet had trodden  he lifted her again  and carried her up the staircase to their rooms  There  he laid her down on a couch  where her child and Miss Pross wept over her    he said  softly  to the latter  
 throwing her arms passionately round him  in a burst of grief   He bent over the child  and laid her blooming cheek against his face  He put her gently from him  and looked at her unconscious mother    he said  and paused--
 It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips  he murmured some words  The child  who was nearest to him  told them afterwards  and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady  that she heard him say   When he had gone out into the next room  he turned suddenly on Mr  Lorry and her father  who were following  and said to the latter:   answer in great trouble  and very slowly      he added  with a smile and a sigh together  
  said Doctor Manette  
      Mr  Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door  and  touching him on the shoulder as he was going away  caused him to turn       Mr  Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post  and bowed his face upon it    said Carton  very gently; 
  returned Mr  Lorry  drying his eyes  
  And walked with a settled step  down-stairs      XII  Darkness   Sydney Carton paused in the street  not quite decided where to go   he said  with a musing face  
 Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object  he took a turn or two in the already darkening street  and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences  His first impression was confirmed   he said  finally resolved  
towards Saint Antoine   Defarge had described himself  that day  as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb  It was not difficult for one who knew the city well  to find his house without asking any question  Having ascertained its situation  Carton came out of those closer streets again  and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner  For the first time in many years  he had no strong drink  Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine  and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr  Lorry s hearth like a man who had done with it   It was as late as seven o clock when he awoke refreshed  and went out into the streets again  As he passed along towards Saint Antoine  he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror  and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat  and his coat-collar  and his wild hair  This done  he went on direct to Defarge s  and went in   There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three  of the restless fingers and the croaking voice  This man  whom he had seen upon the Jury  stood drinking at the little counter  in conversation with the Defarges  man and wife  The Vengeance assisted in the conversation  like a regular member of the establishment   As Carton walked in  took his seat and asked  in very indifferent French  for a small measure of wine  Madame Defarge cast a careless glance at him  and then a keener  and then a keener  and then advanced to him herself  and asked him what it was he had ordered   He repeated what he had already said   eyebrows   After looking at her  as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him  he answered  in his former strong foreign accent   Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine  and  as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning  he heard her say   Defarge brought him the wine  and gave him Good Evening      filling his glass  
 Defarge went back to the counter  and said  Madame sternly retorted  pacifically remarked  The amiable Vengeance added  with a laugh   Carton followed the lines and words of his paper  with a slow forefinger  and with a studious and absorbed face  They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together  speaking low  After a silence of a few moments  during which they all looked towards him without disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor  they resumed their conversation    observed Jacques Three  
  reasoned Defarge  
  approved   troubled;     repeated madame; 
his paper   and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her  as if the axe had dropped      pursued madame  implacably  addressing her husband  
  protested Defarge  
  said Madame Defarge  wrathfully; 
         returned madame; 
 Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was  without seeing her--and both highly commended it  Defarge  a weak minority  interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply   Customers entered  and the group was broken up  The English customer paid for what he had had  perplexedly counted his change  and asked  as a stranger  to be directed towards the National Palace  Madame Defarge took him to the door  and put her arm on his  in pointing out the road  The English customer was not without his reflections then  that it might be a good deed to seize that arm  lift it  and strike under it sharp and deep   But  he went his way  and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall  At the appointed hour  he emerged from it to present himself in Mr  Lorry s room again  where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety  He said he had been with Lucie until just now  and had only left her for a few minutes  to come and keep his appointment  Her father had not been seen  since he quitted the banking-house towards four o clock  She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles  but they were very slight  He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be   Mr  Lorry waited until ten; but  Doctor Manette not returning  and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer  it was arranged that he should go back to her  and come to the banking-house again at midnight  In the meanwhile  Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor   He waited and waited  and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back  Mr  Lorry returned  and found no tidings of him  and brought none  Where could he be   They were discussing this question  and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence  when they heard him on the stairs  The instant he entered the room  it was plain that all was lost   Whether he had really been to any one  or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets  was never known  As he stood staring at them  they asked him no question  for his face told them everything    said he  
 His head and throat were bare  and  as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around  he took his coat off  and let it drop on the floor    They looked at one another  and their hearts died within them    said he  in a whimpering miserable way; 
 Receiving no answer  he tore his hair  and beat his feet upon the ground  like a distracted child   cry;  Lost  utterly lost!  It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him  or try to restore him  that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder  and soothed him to sit down before the fire  with a promise that he should have his work presently  He sank into the chair  and brooded over the embers  and shed tears  As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy  or a dream  Mr  Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping   Affected  and impressed with terror as they both were  by this spectacle of ruin  it was not a time to yield to such emotions  His lonely daughter  bereft of her final hope and reliance  appealed to them both too strongly  Again  as if by agreement  they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces  Carton was the first to speak:    answered Mr  Lorry  
 The figure in the chair between them  was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro  and moaning  They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night   Carton stooped to pick up the coat  which lay almost entangling his feet  As he did so  a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day s duties  fell lightly on the floor  Carton took it up  and there was a folded paper in it  exclaimed    his coat  and took another paper from it   Mr  Lorry held it open in his hand  gazing in his earnest face         name--    touching the back of the Doctor s chair  
   His manner was so fervent and inspiring  that Mr  Lorry caught the flame  and was as quick as youth   on as before       hand        Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness  and though he even put the old man s hand to his lips  he did not part from him then  He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers  as to get a cloak and hat put upon it  and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have  He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it--outwatched the awful night  He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone  looking up at the light in the window of her room  Before he went away  he breathed a blessing towards it  and a Farewell      XIII  Fifty-two   In the black prison of the Conciergerie  the doomed of the day awaited their fate  They were in number as the weeks of the year  Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea  Before their cells were quit of them  new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday  the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart   Two score and twelve were told off  From the farmer-general of seventy  whose riches could not buy his life  to the seamstress of twenty  whose poverty and obscurity could not save her  Physical diseases  engendered in the vices and neglects of men  will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder  born of unspeakable suffering  intolerable oppression  and heartless indifference  smote equally without distinction   Charles Darnay  alone in a cell  had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal  In every line of the narrative he had heard  he had heard his condemnation  He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him  that he was virtually sentenced by the millions  and that units could avail him nothing   Nevertheless  it was not easy  with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him  to compose his mind to what it must bear  His hold on life was strong  and it was very  very hard  to loosen; by gradual efforts and degrees unclosed a little here  it clenched the tighter there; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded  this was closed again  There was a hurry  too  in all his thoughts  a turbulent and heated working of his heart  that contended against resignation  If  for a moment  he did feel resigned  then his wife and child who had to live after him  seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing   But  all this was at first  Before long  the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet  and that numbers went the same road wrongfully  and trod it firmly every day  sprang up to stimulate him  Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind enjoyable by the dear ones  depended on his quiet fortitude  So  by degrees he calmed into the better state  when he could raise his thoughts much higher  and draw comfort down   Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation  he had travelled thus far on his last way  Being allowed to purchase the means of writing  and a light  he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished   He wrote a long letter to Lucie  showing her that he had known nothing of her father s imprisonment  until he had heard of it from herself  and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father s and uncle s responsibility for that misery  until the paper had been read  He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished  was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal  and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage  He entreated her  for her father s sake  never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper  or had had it recalled to him  for the moment  or for good   by the story of the Tower  on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden  If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it  there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille  when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there  and which had been described to all the world  He besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console her father  by impressing him through every tender means she could think of  with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself  but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes  Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing  and her overcoming of her sorrow  to devote herself to their dear child  he adjured her  as they would meet in Heaven  to comfort her father   To her father himself  he wrote in the same strain; but  he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care  And he told him this  very strongly  with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be tending   To Mr  Lorry  he commended them all  and explained his worldly affairs  That done  with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm attachment  all was done  He never thought of Carton  His mind was so full of the others  that he never once thought of him   He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out  When he lay down on his straw bed  he thought he had done with this world   But  it beckoned him back in his sleep  and showed itself in shining forms  Free and happy  back in the old house in Soho  though it had nothing in it like the real house   unaccountably released and light of heart  he was with Lucie again  and she told him it was all a dream  and he had never gone away  A pause of forgetfulness  and then he had even suffered  and had come back to her  dead and at peace  and yet there was no difference in him  Another pause of oblivion  and he awoke in the sombre morning  unconscious where he was or what had happened  until it flashed upon his mind   Thus  had he come through the hours  to the day when the fifty-two heads were to fall  And now  while he was composed  and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism  a new action began in his waking thoughts  which was very difficult to master   He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life  How high it was from the ground  how many steps it had  where he would be stood  how he would be touched  whether the touching hands would be dyed red  which way his face would be turned  whether he would be the first  or might be the last: these and many similar questions  in nowise directed by his will  obtruded themselves over and over again  countless times  Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no fear  Rather  they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like the wondering of some other spirit within his  than his own   The hours went on as he walked to and fro  and the clocks struck the numbers he would never hear again  Nine gone for ever  ten gone for ever  eleven gone for ever  twelve coming on to pass away  After a hard contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed him  he had got the better of it  He walked up and down  softly repeating their names to himself  The worst of the strife was over  He could walk up and down  free from distracting fancies  praying for himself and for them   Twelve gone for ever   He had been apprised that the final hour was Three  and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier  inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily and slowly through the streets  Therefore  he resolved to keep Two before his mind  as the hour  and so to strengthen himself in the interval that he might be able  after that time  to strengthen others   Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast  a very different man from the prisoner  who had walked to and fro at La Force  he heard One struck away from him  without surprise  The hour had measured like most other hours  Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession  he thought  turned to walk again   Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door  He stopped   The key was put in the lock  and turned  Before the door was opened  or as it opened  a man said in a low voice  in English:  The door was quickly opened and closed  and there stood before him face to face  quiet  intent upon him  with the light of a smile on his features  and a cautionary finger on his lip  Sydney Carton   There was something so bright and remarkable in his look  that  for the first moment  the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own imagining  But  he spoke  and it was his voice; he took the prisoner s hand  and it was his real grasp    --the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--
  The prisoner wrung his hand      The prisoner turned his face partly aside    There was a chair against the wall of the cell  behind the prisoner  Carton  pressing forward  had already  with the speed of lightning  got him down into it  and stood over him  barefoot      With wonderful quickness  and with a strength both of will and action  that appeared quite supernatural  he forced all these changes upon him  The prisoner was like a young child in his hands       Pressing his hand to his bewildered head  Darnay sat down at the table  Carton  with his right hand in his breast  stood close beside him        The prisoner looked up  at each question  Carton  standing over him with his hand in his breast  looked down    said Carton  dictating  
 He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote  the hand stopped  closing upon something       dictated again  words with his eyes fixed on the writer  his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer s face   The pen dropped from Darnay s fingers on the table  and he looked about him vacantly       As if his memory were impaired  or his faculties disordered  the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention  As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing  Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him    The prisoner bent over the paper  once more   softly stealing down;  the hand was at the prisoner s face; 
unintelligible signs   Carton s hand moved back to his breast no more  The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look  but Carton s hand was close and firm at his nostrils  and Carton s left arm caught him round the waist  For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but  within a minute or so  he was stretched insensible on the ground   Quickly  but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was  Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside  combed back his hair  and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn  Then  he softly called   insensible figure  putting the paper in the breast:   the Spy answered  with a timid snap of his fingers  
        last moment    returned Carton  stamping his foot; 
 The Spy withdrew  and Carton seated himself at the table  resting his forehead on his hands  The Spy returned immediately  with two men    said one of them  contemplating the fallen figure  
  said the other  
 They raised the unconscious figure  placed it on a litter they had brought to the door  and bent to carry it away     answered Carton  
  said Barsad  
 The door closed  and Carton was left alone  Straining his powers of listening to the utmost  he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm  There was none  Keys turned  doors clashed  footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised  or hurry made  that seemed unusual  Breathing more freely in a little while  he sat down at the table  and listened again until the clock struck Two   Sounds that he was not afraid of  for he divined their meaning  then began to be audible  Several doors were opened in succession  and finally his own  A gaoler  with a list in his hand  looked in  merely saying  at a distance  It was a dark winter day  and what with the shadows within  and what with the shadows without  he could but dimly discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound  Some were standing; some seated  Some were lamenting  and in restless motion; but  these were few  The great majority were silent and still  looking fixedly at the ground   As he stood by the wall in a dim corner  while some of the fifty-two were brought in after him  one man stopped in passing  to embrace him  as having a knowledge of him  It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on  A very few moments after that  a young woman  with a slight girlish form  a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour  and large widely opened patient eyes  rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting  and came to speak to him    she said  touching him with her cold hand  
 He murmured for answer:   The forlorn smile with which she said it  so touched him  that tears started from his eyes    As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to  it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl      As the patient eyes were lifted to his face  he saw a sudden doubt in them  and then astonishment  He pressed the work-worn  hunger-worn young fingers  and touched his lips               *****  The same shadows that are falling on the prison  are falling  in that same hour of the early afternoon  on the Barrier with the crowd about it  when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined    The papers are handed out  and read    This is he; this helpless  inarticulately murmuring  wandering old man pointed out    Greatly too much for him    This is she    It is    She and no other    He lies here  in this corner of the carriage  He  too  is pointed out    It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air  It is represented that he is not in strong health  and has separated sadly from a friend who is under the displeasure of the Republic     It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions  It is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door  replying to a group of officials  They leisurely walk round the carriage and leisurely mount the box  to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about  press nearer to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child  carried by its mother  has its short arm held out for it  that it may touch the wife of an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine       These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry  as he clasps his hands  and looks upward  There is terror in the carriage  there is weeping  there is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller   asks Lucie  clinging to the old man      Houses in twos and threes pass by us  solitary farms  ruinous buildings  dye-works  tanneries  and the like  open country  avenues of leafless trees  The hard uneven pavement is under us  the soft deep mud is on either side  Sometimes  we strike into the skirting mud  to avoid the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes  we stick in ruts and sloughs there  The agony of our impatience is then so great  that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing anything but stopping   Out of the open country  in again among ruinous buildings  solitary farms  dye-works  tanneries  and the like  cottages in twos and threes  avenues of leafless trees  Have these men deceived us  and taken us back by another road  Is not this the same place twice over  Thank Heaven  no  A village  Look back  look back  and see if we are pursued! Hush! the posting-house   Leisurely  our four horses are taken out; leisurely  the coach stands in the little street  bereft of horses  and with no likelihood upon it of ever moving again; leisurely  the new horses come into visible existence  one by one; leisurely  the new postilions follow  sucking and plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely  the old postilions count their money  make wrong additions  and arrive at dissatisfied results  All the time  our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled   At length the new postilions are in their saddles  and the old are left behind  We are through the village  up the hill  and down the hill  and on the low watery grounds  Suddenly  the postilions exchange speech with animated gesticulation  and the horses are pulled up  almost on their haunches  We are pursued          The night comes on dark  He moves more; he is beginning to revive  and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him  by his name  what he has in his hand  O pity us  kind Heaven  and help us! Look out  look out  and see if we are pursued   The wind is rushing after us  and the clouds are flying after us  and the moon is plunging after us  and the whole wild night is in pursuit of us; but  so far  we are pursued by nothing else      XIV  The Knitting Done   In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury  Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers  but in the shed of the wood-sawyer  erst a mender of roads  The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference  but abided at a little distance  like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required  or to offer an opinion until invited    said Jacques Three  
 notes   a slight frown on her lieutenant s lips   with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth;   said madame  
  croaked Jacques Three  
 Madame Defarge cast down her eyes  and reflected a little   of his words     croaked Jacques Three; 
  Madame Defarge went on  
 The wood-sawyer  who held her in the respect  and himself in the submission  of mortal fear  advanced with his hand to his red cap     cried the sawyer  
 He made all manner of gestures while he spoke  as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen    said Jacques Three  
 eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile     said Madame Defarge  pondering again  
   argued Madame Defarge; 
 The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses  The little citizen  not to be outdone  declared her to be a celestial witness    said Madame Defarge  
 The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer  who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans  and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans  if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber  He was so very demonstrative herein  that he might have been suspected  perhaps was  by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge s head  of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety  every hour in the day    said madame  
 The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness  The citizeness looking at him  he became embarrassed  evaded her glance as a small dog would have done  retreated among his wood  and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw   Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door  and there expounded her further views to them thus:   Three  rapturously  embraced her   lieutenant s hands   alacrity  and kissing her cheek    The Vengeance  calling after her  for she had already turned into the street   Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand  to imply that she heard  and might be relied upon to arrive in good time  and so went through the mud  and round the corner of the prison wall  The Vengeance and the Juryman  looking after her as she walked away  were highly appreciative of her fine figure  and her superb moral endowments   There were many women at that time  upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but  there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman  now taking her way along the streets  Of a strong and fearless character  of shrewd sense and readiness  of great determination  of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity  but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up  under any circumstances  But  imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong  and an inveterate hatred of a class  opportunity had developed her into a tigress  She was absolutely without pity  If she had ever had the virtue in her  it had quite gone out of her   It was nothing to her  that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw  not him  but them  It was nothing to her  that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment  because they were her natural enemies and her prey  and as such had no right to live  To appeal to her  was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity  even for herself  If she had been laid low in the streets  in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged  she would not have pitied herself; nor  if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow  would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there   Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe  Carelessly worn  it was a becoming robe enough  in a certain weird way  and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap  Lying hidden in her bosom  was a loaded pistol  Lying hidden at her waist  was a sharpened dagger  Thus accoutred  and walking with the confident tread of such a character  and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood  bare-foot and bare-legged  on the brown sea-sand  Madame Defarge took her way along the streets   Now  when the journey of the travelling coach  at that very moment waiting for the completion of its load  had been planned out last night  the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr  Lorry s attention  It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach  but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining it and its passengers  should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there  Finally  he had proposed  after anxious consideration  that Miss Pross and Jerry  who were at liberty to leave the city  should leave it at three o clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period  Unencumbered with luggage  they would soon overtake the coach  and  passing it and preceding it on the road  would order its horses in advance  and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night  when delay was the most to be dreaded   Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency  Miss Pross hailed it with joy  She and Jerry had beheld the coach start  had known who it was that Solomon brought  had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense  and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach  even as Madame Defarge  taking her way through the streets  now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation   was so great that she could hardly speak  or stand  or move  or live:   returned Mr  Cruncher  
 Miss Pross  wildly crying    returned Mr  Cruncher  
  cried Miss Pross  still wildly crying  
 an ashy and solemn visage    returned Miss Pross  
  returned Jerry  
 striving to dry her eyes and compose herself   most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit-- Miss Pross   additional slowness  and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out  conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one   And still Madame Defarge  pursuing her way along the streets  came nearer and nearer    said Miss Pross  
 Still  Madame Defarge  pursuing her way along the streets  came nearer and nearer    said Miss Pross  
 Mr  Cruncher thought it might be best    Mr  Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar  Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away  and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed    said Miss Pross  
   said Miss Pross  
   returned Miss Pross  
 This exordium  and Miss Pross s two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his  decided Mr  Cruncher  With an encouraging nod or two  he immediately went out to alter the arrangements  and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed   The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution  was a great relief to Miss Pross  The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets  was another relief  She looked at her watch  and it was twenty minutes past two  She had no time to lose  but must get ready at once   Afraid  in her extreme perturbation  of the loneliness of the deserted rooms  and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them  Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes  which were swollen and red  Haunted by her feverish apprehensions  she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water  but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her  In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out  for she saw a figure standing in the room   The basin fell to the ground broken  and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge  By strange stern ways  and through much staining blood  those feet had come to meet that water   Madame Defarge looked coldly at her  and said   It flashed upon Miss Pross s mind that the doors were all standing open  and would suggest the flight  Her first act was to shut them  There were four in the room  and she shut them all  She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied   Madame Defarge s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement  and rested on her when it was finished  Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness  or softened the grimness  of her appearance; but  she too was a determined woman in her different way  and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes  every inch   Pross  in her breathing   Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully  but still with something of Miss Pross s own perception that they two were at bay  She saw a tight  hard  wiry woman before her  as Mr  Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand  in the years gone by  She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family s malevolent enemy   her hand towards the fatal spot    said Miss Pross  
 Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other s words; both were very watchful  and intent to deduce from look and manner  what the unintelligible words meant    said Madame Defarge  
  returned Miss Pross  
 Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but  she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught    said Madame Defarge  frowning  
This  with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm    said Miss Pross  
 Neither of them for a single moment released the other s eyes  Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her; but  she now advanced one step    said Miss Pross  
 Thus Miss Pross  with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence  and every rapid sentence a whole breath  Thus Miss Pross  who had never struck a blow in her life   But  her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes  This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness  laughed   Then she raised her voice and called out  
 Perhaps the following silence  perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross s face  perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion  whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone  Three of the doors she opened swiftly  and looked in    Madame Defarge understood the answer     said Miss Pross to herself; 
 Madame Defarge    Madame Defarge made at the door  Miss Pross  on the instinct of the moment  seized her round the waist in both her arms  and held her tight  It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross  with the vigorous tenacity of love  always so much stronger than hate  clasped her tight  and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had  The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but  Miss Pross  with her head down  held her round the waist  and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman   Soon  Madame Defarge s hands ceased to strike  and felt at her encircled waist   said Miss Pross  in smothered tones  
 Madame Defarge s hands were at her bosom  Miss Pross looked up  saw what it was  struck at it  struck out a flash and a crash  and stood alone--blinded with smoke   All this was in a second  As the smoke cleared  leaving an awful stillness  it passed out on the air  like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground   In the first fright and horror of her situation  Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she could  and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help  Happily  she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did  in time to check herself and go back  It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but  she did go in  and even went near it  to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear  These she put on  out on the staircase  first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key  She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry  and then got up and hurried away   By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet  or she could hardly have gone along the streets without being stopped  By good fortune  too  she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman  She needed both advantages  for the marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face  and her hair was torn  and her dress  hastily composed with unsteady hands  was clutched and dragged a hundred ways   In crossing the bridge  she dropped the door key in the river  Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort  and waiting there  she thought  what if the key were already taken in a net  what if it were identified  what if the door were opened and the remains discovered  what if she were stopped at the gate  sent to prison  and charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts  the escort appeared  took her in  and took her away    question and by her aspect    said Miss Pross  
 It was in vain for Mr  Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him   thought Mr  Cruncher  amazed  
 presently   Again Mr  Cruncher nodded his head    much disturbed;   said Miss Pross  
 more disturbed    said Miss Pross  seeing that he spoke to her  
  said Mr  Cruncher  glancing over his shoulder  
 And indeed she never did      XV  The Footsteps Die Out For Ever   Along the Paris streets  the death-carts rumble  hollow and harsh  Six tumbrils carry the day s wine to La Guillotine  All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself  are fused in the one realisation  Guillotine  And yet there is not in France  with its rich variety of soil and climate  a blade  a leaf  a root  a sprig  a peppercorn  which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror  Crush humanity out of shape once more  under similar hammers  and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms  Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again  and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind   Six tumbrils roll along the streets  Change these back again to what they were  thou powerful enchanter  Time  and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs  the equipages of feudal nobles  the toilettes of flaring Jezebels  the churches that are not my father s house but dens of thieves  the huts of millions of starving peasants! No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator  never reverses his transformations  the wise Arabian stories  Changeless and hopeless  the tumbrils roll along   As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round  they seem to plough up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  Ridges of faces are thrown to this side and to that  and the ploughs go steadily onward  So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle  that in many windows there are no people  and in some the occupation of the hands is not so much as suspended  while the eyes survey the faces in the tumbrils  Here and there  the inmate has visitors to see the sight; then he points his finger  with something of the complacency of a curator or authorised exponent  to this cart and to this  and seems to tell who sat here yesterday  and who there the day before   Of the riders in the tumbrils  some observe these things  and all things on their last roadside  with an impassive stare; others  with a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  Some  seated with drooping heads  are sunk in silent despair; again  there are some so heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have seen in theatres  and in pictures  Several close their eyes  and think  or try to get their straying thoughts together  Only one  and he a miserable creature  of a crazed aspect  is so shattered and made drunk by horror  that he sings  and tries to dance  Not one of the whole number appeals by look or gesture  to the pity of the people   There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils  and faces are often turned up to some of them  and they are asked some question  It would seem to be always the same question  for  it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart  The horsemen abreast of that cart  frequently point out one man in it with their swords  The leading curiosity is  to know which is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down  to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart  and holds his hand  He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him  and always speaks to the girl  Here and there in the long street of St  Honore  cries are raised against him  If they move him at all  it is only to a quiet smile  as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face  He cannot easily touch his face  his arms being bound   On the steps of a church  awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils  stands the Spy and prison-sheep  He looks into the first of them: not there  He looks into the second: not there  He already asks himself       The man cries      But the man continuing to exclaim  Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  Evremonde then sees the Spy  and looks attentively at him  and goes his way   The clocks are on the stroke of three  and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round  to come on into the place of execution  and end  The ridges thrown to this side and to that  now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on  for all are following to the Guillotine  In front of it  seated in chairs  as in a garden of public diversion  are a number of women  busily knitting  On one of the fore-most chairs  stands The Vengeance  looking about for her friend    she cries  in her shrill tones  
   cries The Vengeance  petulantly  
  Ay! Louder  Vengeance  much louder  and still she will scarcely hear thee  Louder yet  Vengeance  with a little oath or so added  and yet it will hardly bring her  Send other women up and down to seek her  lingering somewhere; and yet  although the messengers have done dread deeds  it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far enough to find her!   cries The Vengeance  stamping her foot in the chair  
 As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it  the tumbrils begin to discharge their loads  The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are robed and ready  Crash!--A head is held up  and the knitting-women who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could think and speak  count One   The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up  Crash!--And the knitting-women  never faltering or pausing in their Work  count Two   The supposed Evremonde descends  and the seamstress is lifted out next after him  He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out  but still holds it as he promised  He gently places her with her back to the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls  and she looks into his face and thanks him     says Sydney Carton  
   The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims  but they speak as if they were alone  Eye to eye  voice to voice  hand to hand  heart to heart  these two children of the Universal Mother  else so wide apart and differing  have come together on the dark highway  to repair home together  and to rest in her bosom         endurance  fill with tears  and the lips part a little more and tremble:     She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other  The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than a sweet  bright constancy is in the patient face  She goes next before him--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two    The murmuring of many voices  the upturning of many faces  the pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd  so that it swells forward in a mass  like one great heave of water  all flashes away  Twenty-Three           *****  They said of him  about the city that night  that it was the peacefullest man s face ever beheld there  Many added that he looked sublime and prophetic   One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked at the foot of the same scaffold  not long before  to be allowed to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  If he had given any utterance to his  and they were prophetic  they would have been these:  prosperous and happy  in that England which I shall see no more  I see Her with a child upon her bosom  who bears my name  I see her father  aged and bent  but otherwise restored  and faithful to all men in his healing office  and at peace  I see the good old man  so long their friend  in ten years  time enriching them with all he has  and passing tranquilly to his reward   winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  I see him winning it so well  that my name is made illustrious there by the light of his  I see the blots I threw upon it  faded away  I see him  fore-most of just judges and honoured men  bringing a boy of my name  with a forehead that I know and golden hair  to this place--then fair to look upon  with not a trace of this day s disfigurement--and I hear him tell the child my story  with a tender and a faltering voice

you believe in me or not I do 
walk the earth  and why do they come to me It is required of every man 
his fellowmen  and travel far and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life  it is condemned to do so after death  It is doomed to wander through the world--oh  woe is me!--and witness what it cannot share  but might have shared on earth  and turned to happiness!You are fettered 
me why I wear the chain I forged in life 
it on of my own free will  and of my own free will I wore it  Is its pattern strange to you Or would you know

Slow!
Seven years dead

On the wings of the wind

Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!Jacob Business!
welfare was my business; charity  mercy  forbearance  and benevolence  were  all  my business  The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!At this time of the rolling year 
fellow-beings with my eyes turned down  and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me!Hear me!

that when Tom s wife died  he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the children s having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning   Good Lord!  says he   Camilla  what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black   So like Matthew! The idea!Good points in him  good points in him 
forbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had  and he never will have  any sense of the proprieties You know I was obliged 
said   It WILL NOT DO  for the credit of the family   I told him that  without deep trimmings  the family was disgraced  I cried about it from breakfast till dinner  I injured my digestion  And at last he flung out in his violent way  and said  with a D   Then do as you like   Thank Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things He paid for them  did he not 
It s not the question  my dear child  who paid for them

I can t guess what it is  ma am 
It s a great cake  A bride-cake  Mine!
Walk me  walk me!Slower!
Call Estella!
Dear Miss Havisham 
How well you look!
I do not 
I am yellow skin and bone 
soul! Certainly not to be expected to look well  poor thing  The idea!And how are you 
Thank you  Miss Havisham 
expected Why  what s the matter with you 
Nothing worth mentioning 
display of my feelings  but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to Then don t think of me 
Very easily said!
witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night  Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs  Chokings and nervous jerkings  however  are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love  If I could be less affectionate and sensitive  I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves  I am sure I wish it could be so  But as to not thinking of you in the night--The idea!is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other I am not aware 
person  my dear No  indeed  my dear  Hem!
Thinking is easy enough 
What is easier  you know 
Oh  yes  yes!
to be so affectionate  but I can t help it  No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise  still I wouldn t change my disposition if I could  It s the cause of much suffering  but it s a consolation to know I posses it  when I wake up in the night There s Matthew!
never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut  and have lain there hours insensible  with my head over the side  and my hair all down  and my feet I don t know where--Much higher than your head  my love 
Matthew s strange and inexplicable conduct  and nobody has thanked me Really I must say I should think not!
You see  my dear 
thank you  my love Without expecting any thanks  or anything of the sort 
is a witness of the extent to which I have choked  and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been  and I have been heard at the piano-forte tuner s across the street  where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance --and now to be told--Matthew will come and see me at last 
when I am laid on that table  That will be his place --there 
husband s there! And Sarah Pocket s there! And Georgiana s there! Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me  And now go!Walk me  walk me!
I suppose there s nothing to be done 
and depart  It s something to have seen the object of one s love and duty for even so short a time  I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night  I wish Matthew could have that comfort  but he sets it at defiance  I am determined not to make a display of my feelings  but it s very hard to be told one wants to feast on one s relations --as if one was a Giant --and to be told to go  The bare idea!Havisham dear!This is my birthday  Pip 
just now  or any one to speak of it  They come here on the day  but they dare not refer to it decay together  The mice have gnawed at it  and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me When the ruin is complete 
they lay me dead  in my bride s dress on the bride s table --which shall be done  and which will be the finished curse upon him --so much the better if it is done on this day!you not begun Halloa!

Joe 
don t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit 
Well  Pip 
What for 
What for  Joe  What is any visit made for 
There is some wisits p r aps 
the question  Pip  But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham  She might think you wanted something --expected something of her Don t you think I might say that I did not  Joe 
You might  old chap 
mightn t You see  Pip 
Havisham done the handsome thing by you  When Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you  she called me back to say to me as that were all Yes  Joe  I heard her 
ALL 
Yes  Joe  I tell you  I heard her 
end on it!--As you was!--Me to the North  and you to the South!--Keep in sunders!But  Joe 
Yes  old chap 
of my being bound  I have never thanked Miss Havisham  or asked after her  or shown that I remember her all four round --and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present  in a total wacancy of hoofs--I don t mean that sort of remembrance  Joe; I don t mean a present 
Or even 
for the front door --or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for general use --or some light fancy article  such as a toasting-fork when she took her muffins --or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like--I don t mean any present at all  Joe 
Well 
what s a door-chain when she s got one always up  And shark-headers is open to misrepresentations  And if it was a toasting-fork  you d go into brass and do yourself no credit  And the oncommonest workman can t show himself oncommon in a gridiron --for a gridiron IS a gridiron a gridiron it will come out  either by your leave or again your leave  and you can t help yourself--My dear Joe 
go on in that way  I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present No  Pip 
and what I say to you is  you are right  Pip 
just now  if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow  I think I would go uptown and make a call on Miss Est--Havisham Which her name 
have been rechris ened Joe Pip has a half-holiday  do as much for Old Orlick Why  what ll you do with a half-holiday  if you get it 
him As to Pip  he s going up town 
Well then  as to Old Orlick  he s a going up town 
   growled Orlick  
 The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper  Orlick plunged at the furnace  drew out a red-hot bar  made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body  whisked it round my head  laid it on the anvil  hammered it out --as if it were I  I thought  and the sparks were my spirting blood --and finally said  when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold  and he again leaned on his hammer --     Joe   My sister had been standing silent in the yard  within hearing --she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener --and she instantly looked in at one of the windows    said she to Joe  
 ill-favored grin     beginning to work herself into a mighty rage    growled the journeyman  
    cried my sister  beginning to scream  
a shriek; and I must remark of my sister  what is equally true of all the violent women I have ever seen  that passion was no excuse for her  because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion  she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it  and became blindly furious by regular stages;   growled the journeyman  between his teeth  
   scream together --which was her next stage  and screamings  beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees  and threw her cap off  and pulled her hair down --which were the last stages on her road to frenzy  Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete success  she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked   What could the wretched Joe do now  after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions  but stand up to his journeyman  and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs  Joe; and further whether he was man enough to come on  Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on  and was on his defence straightway; so  without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons  they went at one another  like two giants  But  if any man in that neighborhood could stand uplong against Joe  I never saw the man  Orlick  as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman  was very soon among the coal-dust  and in no hurry to come out of it  Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister  who had dropped insensible at the window  but who had seen the fight first  I think   and who was carried into the house and laid down  and who was recommended to revive  and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joe s hair  Then  came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and then  with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such a lull --namely  that it was Sunday  and somebody was dead --I went upstairs to dress myself   When I came down again  I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up  without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick s nostrils  which was neither expressive nor ornamental  A pot of beer had appeared from the Jolly Bargemen  and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner  The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Joe  who followed me out into the road to say  as a parting observation that might do me good   With what absurd emotions  for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy  I found myself again going to Miss Havisham s  matters little here  Nor  how I passed and repassed the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring  Nor  how I debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor  how I should undoubtedly have gone  if my time had been my own  to come back   Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate  No Estella    said Miss Pocket  
 When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was  Sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business  But unwilling to hazard the responsibility  she let me in  and presently brought the sharp message that I was to  Everything was unchanged  and Miss Havisham was alone    said she  fixing her eyes upon me  
   with the old restless fingers  
chair towards me   I had been looking round --in fact  for Estella --and I stammered that I hoped she was well    said Miss Havisham; 
 There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words  and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh  that I was at a loss what to say  She spared me the trouble of considering  by dismissing me  When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance  I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by that motion   As I was loitering along the High Street  looking in disconsolately at the shop windows  and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman  who should come out of the bookshop but Mr  Wopsle  Mr  Wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell  in which he had that moment invested sixpence  with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of Pumblechook  with whom he was going to drink tea  No sooner did he see me  than he appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a  prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me  and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor  As I knew it would be miserable at home  and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary  and almost any companionship on the road was better than none  I made no great resistance; consequently  we turned into Pumblechook s just as the street and the shops were lighting up   As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell  I don t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it took until half-past nine o  clock that night  and that when Mr  Wopsle got into Newgate  I thought he never would go to the scaffold  he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career  I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all  as if he had not been running to seed  leaf after leaf  ever since his course began  This  however  was a mere question of length and wearisomeness  What stung me  was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self  When Barnwell began to go wrong  I declare that I felt positively apologetic  Pumblechook s indignant stare so taxed me with it  Wopsle  too  took pains to present me in the worst light  At once ferocious and maudlin  I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument  on every occasion; it became sheer monomania in my master s daughter to care a button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning  is  that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character  Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book  Pumblechook sat staring at me  and shaking his head  and saying  murdering a near relation  provided I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor   It was a very dark night when it was all over  and when I set out with Mr  Wopsle on the walk home  Beyond town  we found a heavy mist out  and it fell wet and thick  The turnpike lamp was a blur  quite out of the lamp s usual place apparently  and its rays looked solid substance on the fog  We were noticing this  and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes  when we came upon a man  slouching under the lee of the turnpike house    we said  stopping  
  he answered  slouching out  
  Orlick not unnaturally answered    said Mr  Wopsle  exalted with his late performance --
 Old Orlick growled  as if he had nothing to say about that  and we all went on together  I asked him presently whether he had been spending his half-holiday up and down town    said he  
   In effect  we had not walked many yards further  when the well-remembered boom came towards us  deadened by the mist  and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river  as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives    said Orlick  
 The subject was a suggestive one to me  and I thought about it in silence  Mr  Wopsle  as the ill-requited uncle of the evening s tragedy  fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell  Orlick  with his hands in his pockets  slouched heavily at my side  It was very dark  very wet  very muddy  and so we splashed along  Now and then  the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again  and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river  I kept myself to myself and my thoughts  Mr  Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell  and exceedingly game on Bosworth Field  and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury  Orlick sometimes growled   Thus  we came to the village  The way by which we approached it took us past the Three Jolly Bargemen  which we were surprised to find--it being eleven o clock--in a state of commotion  with the door wide open  and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about  Mr  Wopsle dropped into ask what was the matter  surmising that a convict had been taken   but came running out in a great hurry    said he  without stopping  
   We were running too fast to admit of more being said  and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen  It was full of people; the whole village was there  or in the yard; and there was a surgeon  and there was Joe  and there were a group of women  all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen  The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me  and so I became aware of my sister --lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head  dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the fire --destined never to be on the Rampage again  while she was the wife of Joe      Chapter XVI  With my head full of George Barnwell  I was at first disposed to believe that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister  or at all events that as her near relation  popularly known to be under obligations to her  I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else  But when  in the clearer light of next morning  I began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides  I took another view of the case  which was more reasonable   Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen  smoking his pipe  from a quarter after eight o clock to a quarter before ten  While he was there  my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door  and had exchanged Good Night with a farm-laborer going home  The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her  he got into dense confusion when he tried to be   than that it must have been before nine  When Joe went home at five minutes before ten  he found her struck down on the floor  and promptly called in assistance  The fire had not then burnt unusually low  nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the candle  however  had been blown out   Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house  Neither  beyond the blowing out of the candle --which stood on a table between the door and my sister  and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck --was there any disarrangement of the kitchen  excepting such as she herself had made  in falling and bleeding  But  there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot  She had been struck with something blunt and heavy  on the head and spine; after the blows were dealt  something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence  as she lay on her face  And on the ground beside her  when Joe picked her up  was a convict s leg-iron which had been filed asunder   Now  Joe  examining this iron with a smith s eye  declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago  The hue and cry going off to the Hulks  and people coming thence to examine the iron  Joe s opinion was corroborated  They did not undertake to say when it had left the prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night  Further  one of those two was already retaken  and had not freed himself of his iron   Knowing what I knew  I set up an inference of my own here  I believed the iron to be my convict s iron --the iron I had seen and heard him filing at  on the marshes --but my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use  For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it  and to have turned it to this cruel account  Either Orlick  or the strange man who had shown me the file   Now  as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike  he had been seen about town all the evening  he had been in divers companies in several public-houses  and he had come back with myself and Mr  Wopsle  There was nothing against him  save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him  and with everybody else about her  ten thousand times  As to the strange man; if he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute about them  because my sister was fully prepared to restore them  Besides  there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly  that she had been felled before she could look round   It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon  however undesignedly  but I could hardly think otherwise  I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story  For months afterwards  I every day settled the question finally in the negative  and reopened and reargued it next morning  The contention came  after all  to this;--the secret was such an old one now  had so grown into me and become a part of myself  that I could not tear it away  In addition to the dread that  having led up to so much mischief  it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he believed it  I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it  but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a monstrous invention  However  I temporized with myself  of course--for  was I not wavering between right and wrong  when the thing is always done --and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant   The Constables and the Bow Street men from London--for  this happened in the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police--were about the house for a week or two  and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases  They took up several obviously wrong people  and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas  and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas  instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances  Also  they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen  with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink  that was almost as good as taking the culprit  But not quite  for they never did it   Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed  my sister lay very ill in bed  Her sight was disturbed  so that she saw objects multiplied  and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her speech was unintelligible  When  at last  she came round so far as to be helped downstairs  it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her  that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech  As she was  very bad handwriting apart  a more than indifferent speller  and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader  extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve  The administration of mutton instead of medicine  the substitution of Tea for Joe  and the baker for bacon  were among the mildest of my own mistakes   However  her temper was greatly improved  and she was patient  A tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state  and afterwards  at intervals of two or three months  she would often put her hands to her head  and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind  We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her  until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us  Mr  Wopsle s great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen  and Biddy became a part of our establishment   It may have been about a month after my sister s reappearance in the kitchen  when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects  and became a blessing to the household  Above all  she was a blessing to Joe  for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife  and had been accustomed  while attending on her of an evening  to turn to me every now and then and say  with his blue eyes moistened  cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life  and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did him good  It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe  though he never knew it   and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered   Biddy s first triumph in her new office  was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me  I had tried hard at it  but had made nothing of it  Thus it was:--  Again and again and again  my sister had traced upon the slate  a character that looked like a curious T  and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted  I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T  from tar to toast and tub  At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer  and on my lustily calling that word in my sister s ear  she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent  Thereupon  I had brought in all our hammers  one after another  but without avail  Then I bethought me of a crutch  the shape being much the same  and I borrowed one in the village  and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence  But she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it  that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck   When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her  this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate  Biddy looked thoughtfully at it  heard my explanation  looked thoughtfully at my sister  looked thoughtfully at Joe  who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter   and ran into the forge  followed by Joe and me    cried Biddy  with an exultant face  
 Orlick  without a doubt! She had lost his name  and could only signify him by his hammer  We told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen  and he slowly laid down his hammer  wiped his brow with his arm  took another wipe at it with his apron  and came slouching out  with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him   I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him  and that I was disappointed by the different result  She manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him  was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced  and motioned that she would have him given something to drink  She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception  she showed every possible desire to conciliate him  and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did  such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master  After that day  a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate  and without Orlick s slouching in and standing doggedly before her  as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it      Chapter XVII  I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life  which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes  by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to Miss Havisham  I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty at the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her  and she spoke of Estella in the very same way  if not in the very same words  The interview lasted but a few minutes  and she gave me a guinea when I was going  and told me to come again on my next birthday  I may mention at once that this became an annual custom  I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion  but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily  if I expected more  Then  and after that  I took it   So unchanging was the dull old house  the yellow light in the darkened room  the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass  that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place  and  while I and everything else outside it grew older  it stood still  Daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it  any more than as to the actual fact  It bewildered me  and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home   Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy  however  Her shoes came up at the heel  her hair grew bright and neat  her hands were always clean  She was not beautiful --she was common  and could not be like Estella --but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered  She had not been with us more than a year  I remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me   when I observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that were very pretty and very good   It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at--writing some passages from a book  to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem--and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about  I laid down my pen  and Biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down    said I  
  She managed our whole domestic life  and wonderfully too; but I did not mean that  though that made what I did mean more surprising    said I  
my knowledge  for I spent my birthday guineas on it  and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no doubt  now  that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price    said Biddy  
  on with her sewing   Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair  and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side  I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl  For I called to mind now  that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade  and the names of our different sorts of work  and our various tools  In short  whatever I knew  Biddy knew  Theoretically  she was already as good a blacksmith as I  or better    said I  
 Biddy looked at me for an instant  and went on with her sewing    I exclaimed  in amazement  
  said Biddy  looking up and laughing  
 What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work  I sat silent  recalling what a drudge she had been until Mr  Wopsle s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living  so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people  I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school  with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered  I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing  for  in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help  as a matter of course  Biddy sat quietly sewing  shedding no more tears  and while I looked at her and thought about it all  it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy  I might have been too reserved  and should have patronized her more  though I did not use that precise word in my meditations  with my confidence    I observed  when I had done turning it over  
 transfer the remark to my sister  and to get up and be busy about her  making her more comfortable;   said I  
 My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that Sunday afternoon  and Biddy and I went out together  It was summer-time  and lovely weather  When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard  and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on  I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect  in my usual way  When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank  with the water rippling at our feet  making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound  I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence    said I  after binding her to secrecy  
  she returned  
  said I  with some severity  
   I exclaimed  impatiently  
  said Biddy  quietly raising her eyebrows; 
   Now  I too had so often thought it a pity  that  in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on  I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own  I told her she was right  and I knew it was much to be regretted  but still it was not to be helped   grass within reach  much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall -- Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on  and returned for answer  but I knew she meant well   two   Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine  and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships   remarked  directing her eyes to the ships again   I was disconcerted  for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to  It was not to be shuffled off now  however  and I answered  I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river  as if I had some thoughts of following it   quietly asked me  after a pause     Biddy pursued  
 Exactly what I myself had thought  many times  Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment  But how could I  a poor dazed village lad  avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day    said I to Biddy  
 In short  I turned over on my face when I came to that  and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head  and wrenched it well  All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced  that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right  if I had lifted it up by my hair  and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot   Biddy was the wisest of girls  and she tried to reason no more with me  She put her hand  which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work  upon my hands  one after another  and gently took them out of my hair  Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way  while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a little --exactly as I had done in the brewery yard --and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by somebody  or by everybody; I can t say which    said Biddy  
and said  with a fresh and pleasant change of voice   her a kiss     And then repeated  with her former pleasant change   I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther  and we did so  and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening  and it was very beautiful  I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated  after all  in these circumstances  than playing beggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks  and being despised by Estella  I thought it would be very good for me if I could get her out of my head  with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies  and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do  and stick to it  and make the best of it  I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy  she would make me miserable  I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty  and I said to myself   We talked a good deal as we walked  and all that Biddy said seemed right  Biddy was never insulting  or capricious  or Biddy to-day and somebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain  and no pleasure  from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine  How could it be  then  that I did not like her much the better of the two    said I  when we were walking homeward  
    said Biddy  
   It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening  as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before  I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that  But Biddy said she was  and she said it decisively  In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet I took it rather ill  too  that she should be so positive on the point   When we came near the churchyard  we had to cross an embankment  and get over a stile near a sluice-gate  There started up  from the gate  or from the rushes  or from the ooze  which was quite in his stagnant way   Old Orlick    he growled  
   said he  
 This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of his  He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of  but used it  like his own pretended Christian name  to affront mankind  and convey an idea of something savagely damaging  When I was younger  I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally  he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook   Biddy was much against his going with us  and said to me in a whisper  I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him  but we didn t want seeing home  He received that piece of information with a yell of laughter  and dropped back  but came slouching after us at a little distance   Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account  I asked her why she did not like him      said Biddy  glancing over her shoulder again  
 However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment  I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation  I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlick s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself      said Biddy  
  said I; 
 I kept an eye on Orlick after that night  and  whenever circumstances were favorable to his dancing at Biddy  got before him to obscure that demonstration  He had struck root in Joe s establishment  by reason of my sister s sudden fancy for him  or I should have tried to get him dismissed  He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions  as I had reason to know thereafter   And now  because my mind was not confused enough before  I complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold  by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella  and that the plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of  but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness  At those times  I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone  and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy --when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile  and scatter my wits again  Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often before I had got them well together  they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought  that perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out   If my time had run out  it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities  I dare say  It never did run out  however  but was brought to a premature end  as I proceed to relate      Chapter XVIII  It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe  and it was a Saturday night  There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargemen  attentive to Mr  Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud  Of that group I was one   A highly popular murder had been committed  and Mr  Wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows  He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description  and identified himself with every witness at the Inquest  He faintly moaned  barbarously bellowed  medical testimony  in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and he piped and shook  as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows  to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness  The coroner  in Mr  Wopsle s hands  became Timon of Athens; the beadle  Coriolanus  He enjoyed himself thoroughly  and we all enjoyed ourselves  and were delightfully comfortable  In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder   Then  and not sooner  I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me  looking on  There was an expression of contempt on his face  and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces    said the stranger to Mr  Wopsle  when the reading was done  
 Everybody started and looked up  as if it were the murderer  He looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically    said he  
  returned Mr  Wopsle  
in a confirmatory murmur    said the stranger; 
  Mr  Wopsle began to reply  
  said the stranger  biting his forefinger at him  
 He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side  in a bullying  interrogative manner  and he threw his forefinger at Mr  Wopsle --as it were to mark him out--before biting it again    said he  
  had a right to him -- Mr  Wopsle was beginning  him    Throwing his finger at him again  
 Mr  Wopsle hesitated  and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him    said the stranger  
  manner      subterfuge      Mr  Wopsle answered    repeated the gentleman bitterly  
  with his right hand extended towards the witness  Wopsle   We all began to suspect that Mr  Wopsle was not the man we had thought him  and that he was beginning to be found out   finger at Mr  Wopsle heavily -- We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far  and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time   The strange gentleman  with an air of authority not to be disputed  and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it  left the back of the settle  and came into the space between the two settles  in front of the fire  where he remained standing  his left hand in his pocket  and he biting the forefinger of his right   all quailed before him    The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place  and Joe went    pursued the stranger  
  The stranger did not recognize me  but I recognized him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs  on the occasion of my second visit to Miss Havisham  I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle  and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder  I checked off again in detail his large head  his dark complexion  his deep-set eyes  his bushy black eyebrows  his large watch-chain  his strong black dots of beard and whisker  and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand   surveyed me at his leisure   Amidst a wondering silence  we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen  and in a wondering silence walked home  While going along  the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me  and occasionally bit the side of his finger  As we neared home  Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one  went on ahead to open the front door  Our conference was held in the state parlor  which was feebly lighted by one candle   It began with the strange gentleman s sitting down at the table  drawing the candle to him  and looking over some entries in his pocket-book  He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside  after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me  to ascertain which was which    he said  
 Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat  he got up  and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus having one foot on the seat of the chair  and one foot on the ground    said Joe  staring   Jaggers    returned Joe  sternly  
 I thought Mr  Jaggers glanced at Joe  as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness  But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise  to be sure of it    said Mr  Jaggers  
    and nodding his head at Joe  as if he were forgiving him something   Joe and I gasped  and looked at one another   his finger at me sideways   My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale    pursued the lawyer  
 My heart was beating so fast  and there was such a singing in my ears  that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection    Once more  I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection   Though he called me Mr  Pip  and began rather to make up to me  he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke  as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement  if he only chose to mention them   for I was going to thank him  
 I said I had always longed for it    I stammered yes  that was it    I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr  Wopsle s great-aunt; so  I replied in the negative    said Mr  Jaggers  
 Ah! I caught at the name directly  Miss Havisham s relation  The Matthew whom Mr  and Mrs  Camilla had spoken of  The Matthew whose place was to be at Miss Havisham s head  when she lay dead  in her bride s dress on the bride s table   shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer   My answer was  that I had heard of the name    said he  
 I said  or tried to say  that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation--  slowly   Not recollecting myself  I began again that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation--  smiling both at once -- Correcting myself  I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention of Mr  Matthew Pocket--  gladly try that gentleman    I said  glancing at Joe  who stood looking on  motionless   that I supposed I could come directly    said Mr  Jaggers  
 He produced a long purse  with the greatest coolness  and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me  This was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair  He sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over  and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe       said Joe  
  said Mr  Jaggers  swinging his purse --
   Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman  I have often thought him since  like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or pat an egg-shell  in his combination of strength with gentleness   said Joe  
 O dear good Joe  whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to  I see you again  with your muscular blacksmith s arm before your eyes  and your broad chest heaving  and your voice dying away  O dear good faithful tender Joe  I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm  as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel s wing!  But I encouraged Joe at the time  I was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes  and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together  I begged Joe to be comforted  for  as he said  we had ever been the best of friends  and  as I said  we ever would be so  Joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist  as if he were bent on gouging himself  but said not another word   Mr  Jaggers had looked on at this  as one who recognized in Joe the village idiot  and in me his keeper  When it was over  he said  weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:--  suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose    cried Joe  
 I drew Joe away  and he immediately became placable; merely stating to me  in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern  that he were not a going to be bull-baited and badgered in his own place  Mr  Jaggers had risen when Joe demonstrated  and had backed near the door  Without evincing any inclination to come in again  he there delivered his valedictory remarks  They were these    He was throwing his finger at both of us  and I think would have gone on  but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous  and going off   Something came into my head which induced me to run after him  as he was going down to the Jolly Bargemen  where he had left a hired carriage     said he  facing round  
     said he  
 I thanked him and ran home again  and there I found that Joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor  and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee  gazing intently at the burning coals  I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals  and nothing was said for a long time   My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner  and Biddy sat at her needle-work before the fire  and Joe sat next Biddy  and I sat next Joe in the corner opposite my sister  The more I looked into the glowing coals  the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the silence lasted  the more unable I felt to speak   At length I got out   knees tight  as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere     said Joe  
 Biddy dropped her work  and looked at me  Joe held his knees and looked at me  I looked at both of them  After a pause  they both heartily congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that I rather resented   I took it upon myself to impress Biddy  and through Biddy  Joe  with the grave obligation I considered my friends under  to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune  It would all come out in good time  I observed  and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said  save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron  Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again  and said she would be very particular; and Joe  still detaining his knees  said  congratulated me again  and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that I didn t half like it   Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened  To the best of my belief  those efforts entirely failed  She laughed and nodded her head a great many times  and even repeated after Biddy  the words  and 
they had more meaning in them than an election cry  and I cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind   I never could have believed it without experience  but as Joe and Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again  I became quite gloomy  Dissatisfied with my fortune  of course I could not be; but it is possible that I may have been  without quite knowing it  dissatisfied with myself   Any how  I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand  looking into the fire  as those two talked about my going away  and about what they should do without me  and all that  And whenever I caught one of them looking at me  though never so pleasantly  and they often looked at me --particularly Biddy   I felt offended: as if they were expressing some mistrust of me  Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign   At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night  and stood open on summer evenings to air the room  The very stars to which I then raised my eyes  I am afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which I had passed my life   and beer      it  in the palm of his left hand  and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices     said Joe  
 Biddy asked me here  as she sat holding my sister s plate    I returned with some resentment  
    Biddy said no more  Handsomely forgiving her  I soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and Joe  and went up to bed  When I got into my little room  I sat down and took a long look at it  as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above  for ever  It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too  and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going  as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham s  and Biddy and Estella   The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic  and the room was warm  As I put the window open and stood looking out  I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door  below  and take a turn or two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come  and bring him a pipe and light it for him  He never smoked so late  and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting  for some reason or other   He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me  smoking his pipe  and Biddy stood there too  quietly talking to him  and I knew that they talked of me  for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once  I would not have listened for more  if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window  and sat down in my one chair by the bedside  feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever known   Looking towards the open window  I saw light wreaths from Joe s pipe floating there  and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe --not obtruded on me or paraded before me  but pervading the air we shared together  I put my light out  and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy bed now  and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more      Chapter XIX  Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life  and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same  What lay heaviest on my mind was  the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile  and that  when I got there  it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone   Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did  After breakfast  Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlor  and we put them in the fire  and I felt that I was free  With all the novelty of my emancipation on me  I went to church with Joe  and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn t have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven  if he had known all   After our early dinner  I strolled out alone  purposing to finish off the marshes at once  and get them done with  As I passed the church  I felt  as I had felt during service in the morning  a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there  Sunday after Sunday  all their lives through  and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds  I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days  and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding  a pint of ale  and a gallon of condescension  upon everybody in the village   If I had often thought before  with something allied to shame  of my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those graves  what were my thoughts on this Sunday  when the place recalled the wretch  ragged and shivering  with his felon iron and badge! My comfort was  that it happened a long time ago  and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off  and that he was dead to me  and might be veritably dead into the bargain   No more low  wet grounds  no more dikes and sluices  no more of these grazing cattle --though they seemed  in their dull manner  to wear a more respectful air now  and to face round  in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations --farewell  monotonous acquaintances of my childhood  henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith s work in general  and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery  and  lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella  fell asleep   When I awoke  I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me  smoking his pipe  He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes  and said --      I went on  after we had shaken hands  
  said Joe  in a comfortable tone  
 Somehow  I was not best pleased with Joe s being so mightily secure of me  I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion  or to have said  no remark on Joe s first head; merely saying as to his second  that the tidings had indeed come suddenly  but that I had always wanted to be a gentleman  and had often and often speculated on what I would do  if I were one    said Joe  
  said I  
  returned Joe  
 What I had meant was  that when I came into my property and was able to do something for Joe  it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station  He was so perfectly innocent of my meaning  however  that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference   So  when we had walked home and had had tea  I took Biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane  and  after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits  that I should never forget her  said I had a favor to ask of her    said I  
   Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke  and although she opened her eyes very wide when I had spoken  she did not look at me   black-currant leaf    leaf in her hand     It was such a very provoking question  for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me   that I said  snappishly --   Biddy  having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands --and the smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane --said    shaking her head;    resumed Biddy  
  said I  
  returned Biddy  
 and superior tone;  I repeated  
  returned poor Biddy  
 I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature  in which sentiment  waiving its application  I have since seen reason to think I was right   and I walked down the little path away from Biddy  and Biddy went into the house  and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this  the second night of my bright fortunes  should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first   But  morning once more brightened my view  and I extended my clemency to Biddy  and we dropped the subject  Putting on the best clothes I had  I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open  and presented myself before Mr  Trabb  the tailor  who was having his breakfast in the parlor behind his shop  and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me  but called me into him    said Mr  Trabb  in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way  
 Mr  Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds  and was slipping butter in between the blankets  and covering it up  He was a prosperous old bachelor  and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard  and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace  and I did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags    said I  
 A change passed over Mr  Trabb  He forgot the butter in bed  got up from the bedside  and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth  exclaiming   guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; thought he might only pretend to make them   his arms  and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow   Mr  Trabb s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side  When I had entered he was sweeping the shop  and he had sweetened his labors by sweeping over me  He was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with Mr  Trabb  and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles  to express  as I understood it  equality with any blacksmith  alive or dead    said Mr  Trabb  with the greatest sternness  
said Mr  Trabb  taking down a roll of cloth  and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter  preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss  dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant s brushing me with it  or making some other sign of familiarity    Mr  Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again  Then he commanded him to bring number five  and number eight   said Mr  Trabb  
 Mr  Trabb then bent over number four  and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear  an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry  an article that it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellow-townsman s  if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman  having worn  Trabb to the boy after that   I selected the materials for a suit  with the assistance of Mr  Trabb s judgment  and re-entered the parlor to be measured  For although Mr  Trabb had my measure already  and had previously been quite contented with it  he said apologetically that it calculated me in the parlor  as if I were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor  and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains  When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mr  Pumblechook s on the Thursday evening  he said  with his hand upon the parlor lock   The last word was flung at the boy  who had not the least notion what it meant  But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands  and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was  that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb s boy   After this memorable event  I went to the hatter s  and the bootmaker s  and the hosier s  and felt rather like Mother Hubbard s dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades  I also went to the coach-office and took my place for seven o clock on Saturday morning  It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect  it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the High Street  and concentrated his mind upon me  When I had ordered everything I wanted  I directed my steps towards Pumblechook s  and  as I approached that gentleman s place of business  I saw him standing at his door   He was waiting for me with great impatience  He had been out early with the chaise-cart  and had called at the forge and heard the news  He had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor  and he too ordered his shopman to  he and I and the collation were alone   This was coming to the point  and I thought it a sensible way of expressing himself   some moments   I begged Mr  Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted  on that point    said Mr  Pumblechook; 
 I murmured and communicated a movement to his waistcoat  which had an emotional appearance  though it was rather low down  compassionate adjuration  head and tapped it  expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph    said Mr  Pumblechook  
down   This May I  meant might he shake hands  I consented  and he was fervent  and then sat down again    said Mr  Pumblechook  
 said Mr  Pumblechook  getting up again  
 I said he might  and he shook hands with me again  and emptied his glass and turned it upside down  I did the same; and if I had turned myself upside down before drinking  the wine could not have gone more direct to my head   Mr  Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing  and to the best slice of tongue  none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now   and took  comparatively speaking  no care of himself at all  fowl in the dish  getting up again   It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might  so he did it at once  How he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife  I don t know    he resumed  after a little steady eating  
 I saw he was about to come at me again  and I stopped him    with admiration  who Sir was  but he certainly was not I  and there was no third person present ; his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again   When he had done it  he resumed his seat and drank to my sister   said Mr  Pumblechook  
 At about this time  I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face; as to myself  I felt all face  steeped in wine and smarting   I mentioned to Mr  Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to his house  and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him  I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village  and he lauded it to the skies  There was nobody but himself  he intimated  worthy of my confidence  and--in short  might he  Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums  and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice  and  in effect  how he had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend  If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had  I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me  and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea  Yet for all that  I remember feeling convinced that I had been much mistaken in him  and that he was a sensible  practical  good-hearted prime fellow   By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me  as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs  He mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises  if enlarged  such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighborhood  What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune  he considered to be More Capital  Those were the two little words  more capital  Now it appeared to him  Pumblechook  that if that capital were got into the business  through a sleeping partner  sir --which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in  by self or deputy  whenever he pleased  and examine the books --and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket  to the tune of fifty per cent --it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property  which would be worthy of his attention  But what did I think  He had great confidence in my opinion  and what did I think  I gave it as my opinion  this view so struck him  that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me  but said he really must --and did   We drank all the wine  and Mr  Pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep Joseph up to the mark  I don t know what mark   and to render me efficient and constant service  I don t know what service   He also made known to me for the first time in my life  and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well  that he had always said of me  think of now  and I said so too  Finally  I went out into the air  with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine  and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road   There  I was roused by Mr  Pumblechook s hailing me  He was a long way down the sunny street  and was making expressive gestures for me to stop  I stopped  and he came up breathless    We shook hands for the hundredth time at least  and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation  Then  he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home   I had scant luggage to take with me to London  for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station  But I began packing that same afternoon  and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next morning  in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost   So  Tuesday  Wednesday  and Thursday  passed; and on Friday morning I went to Mr  Pumblechook s  to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss Havisham  Mr  Pumblechook s own room was given up to me to dress in  and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event  My clothes were rather a disappointment  of course  Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in  fell a trifle short of the wearer s expectation  But after I had had my new suit on some half an hour  and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr  Pumblechook s very limited dressing-glass  in the futile endeavor to see my legs  it seemed to fit me better  It being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off  Mr  Pumblechook was not at home  I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave  and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing  This was all as it should be  and I went out in my new array  fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman  and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage  something like Joe s in his Sunday suit   I went circuitously to Miss Havisham s by all the back ways  and rang at the bell constrainedly  on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves  Sarah Pocket came to the gate  and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow    said she  
  said I  
 I was not expected  for she left me locked in the yard  while she went to ask if I were to be admitted  After a very short delay  she returned and took me up  staring at me all the way   Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table  leaning on her crutch stick  The room was lighted as of yore  and at the sound of our entrance  she stopped and turned  She was then just abreast of the rotted bride-cake    she said  
 careful what I said   round me  as if she  the fairy godmother who had changed me  were bestowing the finishing gift    I murmured  
 delight          She quite gloated on these questions and answers  so keen was her enjoyment of Sarah Pocket s jealous dismay   she went on; 
Sarah s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile     She stretched out her hand  and I went down on my knee and put it to my lips  I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came naturally to me at the moment to do this  She looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes  and so I left my fairy godmother  with both her hands on her crutch stick  standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs   Sarah Pocket conducted me down  as if I were a ghost who must be seen out  She could not get over my appearance  and was in the last degree confounded  I said did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken  Clear of the house  I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook s  took off my new clothes  made them into a bundle  and went back home in my older dress  carrying it--to speak the truth--much more at my ease too  though I had the bundle to carry   And now  those six days which were to have run out so slowly  had run out fast and were gone  and to-morrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it  As the six evenings had dwindled away  to five  to four  to three  to two  I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy  On this last evening  I dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight  and sat in my splendor until bedtime  We had a hot supper on the occasion  graced by the inevitable roast fowl  and we had some flip to finish with  We were all very low  and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits   I was to leave our village at five in the morning  carrying my little hand-portmanteau  and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone  I am afraid--sore afraid--that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe  if we went to the coach together  I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on this last night  I felt compelled to admit that it might be so  and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning  I did not   All night there were coaches in my broken sleep  going to wrong places instead of to London  and having in the traces  now dogs  now cats  now pigs  now men --never horses  Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing  Then  I got up and partly dressed  and sat at the window to take a last look out  and in taking it fell asleep   Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast  that  although I did not sleep at the window an hour  I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon  But long after that  and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready  I wanted the resolution to go downstairs  After all  I remained up there  repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again  until Biddy called to me that I was late   It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it  I got up from the meal  saying with a sort of briskness  as if it had only just occurred to me  laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair  and kissed Biddy  and threw my arms around Joe s neck  Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out  The last I saw of them was  when I presently heard a scuffle behind me  and looking back  saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe  I stopped then  to wave my hat  and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head  crying huskily  I walked away at a good pace  thinking it was easier to go than I had supposed it would be  and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach  in sight of all the High Street  I whistled and made nothing of going  But the village was very peaceful and quiet  and the light mists were solemnly rising  as if to show me the world  and I had been so innocent and little there  and all beyond was so unknown and great  that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears  It was by the finger-post at the end of the village  and I laid my hand upon it  and said   Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears  for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth  overlying our hard hearts  I was better after I had cried than before --more sorry  more aware of my own ingratitude  more gentle  If I had cried before  I should have had Joe with me then   So subdued I was by those tears  and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk  that when I was on the coach  and it was clear of the town  I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back  and have another evening at home  and a better parting  We changed  and I had not made up my mind  and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back  when we changed again  And while I was occupied with these deliberations  I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us  and my heart would beat high --As if he could possibly be there!  We changed again  and yet again  and it was now too late and too far to go back  and I went on  And the mists had all solemnly risen now  and the world lay spread before me   This is the end of the first stage of Pip s expectations   Chapter XX  The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours  It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by which I was a passenger  got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys  Wood Street  Cheapside  London   We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise  while I was scared by the immensity of London  I think I might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly  crooked  narrow  and dirty   Mr  Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was  Little Britain  and he had written after it on his card  as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old  packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps  as if he were going to take me fifty miles  His getting on his box  which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags  was quite a work of time  It was a wonderful equipage  with six great coronets outside  and ragged things behind for I don t know how many footmen to hold on by  and a harrow below them  to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation   I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw-yard it was  and yet how like a rag-shop  and to wonder why the horses  nose-bags were kept inside  when I observed the coachman beginning to get down  as if we were going to stop presently  And stop we presently did  in a gloomy street  at certain offices with an open door  whereon was painted MR  JAGGERS    The coachman answered   I naturally said I had no wish to make it more    observed the coachman  
name  and shook his head   When he had got his shilling  and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box  and had got away  which appeared to relieve his mind   I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked  Was Mr  Jaggers at home    returned the clerk  
 I signified that he was addressing Mr  Pip    With those words  the clerk opened a door  and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back  Here  we found a gentleman with one eye  in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches  who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper    I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting  when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used  and tossing his fur cap out after him  left me alone   Mr  Jaggers s room was lighted by a skylight only  and was a most dismal place; the skylight  eccentrically pitched like a broken head  and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it  There were not so many papers about  as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about  that I should not have expected to see --such as an old rusty pistol  a sword in a scabbard  several strange-looking boxes and packages  and two dreadful casts on a shelf  of faces peculiarly swollen  and twitchy about the nose  Mr  Jaggers s own high-backed chair was of deadly black horsehair  with rows of brass nails round it  like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it  and bit his forefinger at the clients  The room was but small  and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the wall  especially opposite to Mr  Jaggers s chair  being greasy with shoulders  I recalled  too  that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out   I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr  Jaggers s chair  and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place  I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else s disadvantage  as his master had  I wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs  and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures  I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room  and how it came there  I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr  Jaggers s family  and  if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations  why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on  instead of giving them a place at home  Of course I had no experience of a London summer day  and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air  and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything  But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr  Jaggers s close room  until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr  Jaggers s chair  and got up and went out   When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited  he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield  So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place  being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam  seemed to stick to me  So  I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul s bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison  Following the wall of the jail  I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this  and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer  I inferred that the trials were on   While I looked about me here  an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown  whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his wig and robes --mentioning that awful personage like waxwork  and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence  As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment  he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept  and also where people were publicly whipped  and then he showed me the Debtors  Door  out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the morning  to be killed in a row  This was horrible  and gave me a sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice s proprietor wore  from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket-handkerchief inclusive  mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally  and which I took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner  Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling   I dropped into the office to ask if Mr  Jaggers had come in yet  and I found he had not  and I strolled out again  This time  I made the tour of Little Britain  and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr  Jaggers  as well as I  There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close  and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together  one of whom said to the other when they first passed me  that There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner  and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl  and the other comforted her by saying  as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders  little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there  in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand; and while the messenger was gone  I remarked this Jew  who was of a highly excitable temperament  performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and accompanying himself  in a kind of frenzy  with the words  These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me  and I admired and wondered more than ever   At length  as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain  I saw Mr  Jaggers coming across the road towards me  All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time  and there was quite a rush at him  Mr  Jaggers  putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me  addressed himself to his followers   First  he took the two secret men   finger at them   submissively  while the other perused Mr  Jaggers s face     waving his hand at them to put them behind him     said Mr  Jaggers  
 The two men looked at one another as Mr  Jaggers waved them behind again  and humbly fell back and were heard no more   the two women with the shawls  from whom the three men had meekly separated --   retorted Mr  Jaggers  
  exclaimed both women together  
  said Mr  Jaggers  
   said Mr  Jaggers  
   This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately  No one remained now but the excitable Jew  who had already raised the skirts of Mr  Jaggers s coat to his lips several times   strain:    said Mr  Jaggers  
 The suitor  kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it  replied    said Mr  Jaggers  
 turning white    said Mr  Jaggers  
  My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference  and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot  Without further interruption  we reached the front office  where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap   approaching Mr  Jaggers confidentially   hair in the middle of his forehead  like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bell-rope;  constitutional cold;   time;  Mr  Jaggers suddenly became most irate  he  throwing his forefinger at the terrified client   The client looked scared  but bewildered too  as if he were unconscious what he had done   elbow    Mike looked hard at my guardian  as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face  and slowly replied    Mike looked at his cap  and looked at the floor  and looked at the ceiling  and looked at the clerk  and even looked at me  before beginning to reply in a nervous manner  when my guardian blustered out --     After some helpless casting about  Mike brightened and began again:--     said Mike  
  The window indicated was the office window  We all three went to it  behind the wire blind  and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner  with a murderous-looking tall individual  in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap  This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober  and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery  which was painted over   clerk  in extreme disgust   My guardian then took me into his own room  and while he lunched  standing  from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry  he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it   informed me what arrangements he had made for me  I was to go to rooms  where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to remain with young Mr  Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with him to his father s house on a visit  that I might try how I liked it  Also  I was told what my allowance was to be --it was a very liberal one --and had handed to me from one of my guardian s drawers  the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes  and such other things as I could in reason want  like a whole caskful  as he hastily refreshed himself   After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment  I asked Mr  Jaggers if I could send for a coach  He said it was not worth while  I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me  if I pleased   I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room  Another clerk was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out  and I accompanied him into the street  after shaking hands with my guardian  We found a new set of people lingering outside  but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively  and went on side by side      Chapter XXI  Casting my eyes on Mr  Wemmick as we went along  to see what he was like in the light of day  I found him to be a dry man  rather short in stature  with a square wooden face  whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel  There were some marks in it that might have been dimples  if the material had been softer and the instrument finer  but which  as it was  were only dints  The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose  but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off  I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen  and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for he wore at least four mourning rings  besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it  I noticed  too  that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain  as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends  He had glittering eyes --small  keen  and black --and thin wide mottled lips  He had had them  to the best of my belief  from forty to fifty years      said Mr  Wemmick  
   said Mr  Wemmick  
 something than for information    little    returned Mr  Wemmick; 
   returned Mr  Wemmick  
 He wore his hat on the back of his head  and looked straight before him: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention  His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling  We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance  and that he was not smiling at all     said he  nodding in the direction  
    with an approving air   There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text  when he said here we were at Barnard s Inn  My depression was not alleviated by the announcement  for  I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr  Barnard  to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere public-house  Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit  or a fiction  and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom-cats   We entered this haven through a wicket-gate  and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying-ground  I thought it had the most dismal trees in it  and the most dismal sparrows  and the most dismal cats  and the most dismal houses  in number half a dozen or so   that I had ever seen  I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain  crippled flower-pot  cracked glass  dusty decay  and miserable makeshift; while To Let  To Let  To Let  glared at me from empty rooms  as if no new wretches ever came there  and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel  A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard  and it had strewn ashes on its head  and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole  Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar --rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell  and moaned   So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations  that I looked in dismay at Mr  Wemmick   He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs --which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust  so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down --to a set of chambers on the top floor  MR  POCKET  JUN   was painted on the door  and there was a label on the letter-box    Mr  Wemmick explained  
   Mr  Wemmick observed  
  I put out my hand  and Mr  Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought I wanted something  Then he looked at me  and said  correcting himself --   I was rather confused  thinking it must be out of the London fashion  but said yes    said Mr  Wemmick --
 When we had shaken hands and he was gone  I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself  for  the lines had rotted away  and it came down like the guillotine  Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out  After this escape  I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window s encrusting dirt  and to stand dolefully looking out  saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated   Mr  Pocket  Junior s  idea of Shortly was not mine  for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour  and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window  before I heard footsteps on the stairs  Gradually there arose before me the hat  head  neckcloth  waistcoat  trousers  boots  of a member of society of about my own standing  He had a paper-bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand  and was out of breath      he exclaimed  
 For a reason that I had  I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head  I acknowledged his attention incoherently  and began to think this was a dream    said Mr  Pocket  Junior  
 As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper-bags were under his arms  I begged him to allow me to hold them  He relinquished them with an agreeable smile  and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast  It yielded so suddenly at last  that he staggered back upon me  and I staggered back upon the opposite door  and we both laughed  But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head  and as if this must be a dream    said Mr  Pocket  Junior  
 As I stood opposite to Mr  Pocket  Junior  delivering him the bags  One  Two  I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to be in mine  and he said  falling back --    said I  
    Chapter XXII  The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard s Inn  until we both burst out laughing   said he  
contemplated one another afresh  and laughed again  pale young gentleman  reaching out his hand good-humoredly   I derived from this speech that Mr  Herbert Pocket  for Herbert was the pale young gentleman s name  still rather confounded his intention with his execution  But I made a modest reply  and we shook hands warmly   Pocket     he acquiesced: 
   I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that    said Herbert  laughing  
  He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked  which divided his attention  and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word   he explained  still busy with the fruit  
   said he  
     said he  
   said he  
   I told him  and he was attentive until I had finished  and then burst out laughing again  and asked me if I was sore afterwards  I didn t ask him if he was  for my conviction on that point was perfectly established      This was bringing me  I felt  towards dangerous ground  I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise  that I had seen Mr  Jaggers in Miss Havisham s house on the very day of our combat  but never at any other time  and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there    Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking  I had never seen any one then  and I have never seen any one since  who more strongly expressed to me  in every look and tone  a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean  There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air  and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich  I don t know how this was  I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner  but I cannot define by what means   He was still a pale young gentleman  and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness  that did not seem indicative of natural strength  He had not a handsome face  but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful  His figure was a little ungainly  as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it  but it looked as if it would always be light and young  Whether Mr  Trabb s local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me  may be a question; but I am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit   As he was so communicative  I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years  I therefore told him my small story  and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was  I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place  and knew very little of the ways of politeness  I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong    said he  
 I thanked him and said I would  I informed him in exchange that my Christian name was Philip    said he  smiling  
  I answered  
    This I would not hear of  so he took the top  and I faced him  It was a nice little dinner --seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor s Feast --and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances  with no old people by  and with London all around us  This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off; for while the table was  as Mr  Pumblechook might have said  the lap of luxury --being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house --the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor  where he fell over them   the melted butter in the arm-chair  the bread on the bookshelves  the cheese in the coal-scuttle  and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room --where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night  All this made the feast delightful  and when the waiter was not there to watch me  my pleasure was without alloy   We had made some progress in the dinner  when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham    he replied  
 He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way  that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed    he pursued  
   returned Herbert; 
     I had been doing this  in an excess of attention to his recital  I thanked him  and apologized  He said    Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler  I am wholly unable to say  I only know that I found myself  with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause  making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits  Again I thanked him and apologized  and again he said in the cheerfullest manner    I thought of her having said  was so inveterate against her    said he  
  I struck in  
  said Herbert  nodding  
     said Herbert  
 subject       Herbert shrugged his shoulders  he  finally throwing off the story as it were    I retorted  
  In truth  he said this with so much delicacy  that I felt the subject done with  even though I should be under his father s roof for years and years to come  Yet he said it with so much meaning  too  that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress  as I understood the fact myself   It had not occurred to me before  that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it  that I now perceived this to be the case  We were very gay and sociable  and I asked him  in the course of conversation  what he was  He replied  of some tokens of Shipping  or capital  for he added   I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City  and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on his back  blackened his enterprising eye  and cut his responsible head open  But again there came upon me  for my relief  that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich    said he  leaning back in his chair  
   I wavered again  and began to think here were greater expectations than my own   waist-coat pockets     Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions  I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present    he replied  
 Somehow  that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard s Inn  I said  in a tone of conviction        reckoning up and striking a balance   This certainly had not a profitable appearance  and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income    said Herbert Pocket  
 It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn t be out of a counting-house  you know  and look about you; but I silently deferred to his experience    said Herbert  
 This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden; very like  His manner of bearing his poverty  too  exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat  It seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then  It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries  for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else   Yet  having already made his fortune in his own mind  he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up  It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways  and we got on famously  In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets  and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey  and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there  and wished Joe did   On a moderate computation  it was many months  that Sunday  since I had left Joe and Biddy  The space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion  and our marshes were any distance off  That I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes  on the very last Sunday that ever was  seemed a combination of impossibilities  geographical and social  solar and lunar  Yet in the London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening  there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night  the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard s Inn  under pretence of watching it  fell hollow on my heart   On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine  Herbert went to the counting-house to report himself --to look about him  too  I suppose --and I bore him company  He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith  and I was to wait about for him  It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat  like the eggs of ostriches  judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning  Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted  show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard  of a grimy presence in all particulars  and with a look into another back second floor  rather than a look out   I waited about until it was noon  and I went upon  Change  and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping  whom I took to be great merchants  though I couldn t understand why they should all be out of spirits  When Herbert came  we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated  but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe  and where I could not help noticing  even then  that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters  clothes  than in the steaks  This collation disposed of at a moderate price  considering the grease  which was not charged for   we went back to Barnard s Inn and got my little portmanteau  and then took coach for Hammersmith  We arrived there at two or three o clock in the afternoon  and had very little way to walk to Mr  Pocket s house  Lifting the latch of a gate  we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river  where Mr  Pocket s children were playing about  And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned  I saw that Mr  and Mrs  Pocket s children were not growing up or being brought up  but were tumbling up   Mrs  Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree  reading  with her legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs  Pocket s two nurse-maids were looking about them while the children played  Herbert  with an appearance of amiable dignity   children   At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs  Pocket s handkerchief  and said  Mrs  Pocket laughed and said  in one chair only  resumed her book  Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week  but before she could have read half a dozen lines  she fixed her eyes upon me  and said  inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments  when the nurse came to my rescue    she cried  picking up the pocket-handkerchief  
Pocket received her property  at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before  and then with a laugh of recognition  and said  reading   I found  now I had leisure to count them  that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present  in various stages of tumbling up  I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard  as in the region of air  wailing dolefully   surprising   Millers  who was the other nurse  retired into the house  and by degrees the child s wailing was hushed and stopped  as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth  Mrs  Pocket read all the time  and I was curious to know what the book could be   We were waiting  I supposed  for Mr  Pocket to come out to us; at any rate we waited there  and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs  Pocket in their play  they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her --always very much to her momentary astonishment  and their own more enduring lamentation  I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance  and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it  until by and by Millers came down with the baby  which baby was handed to Flopson  which Flopson was handing it to Mrs  Pocket  when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs  Pocket  baby and all  and was caught by Herbert and myself   moment      cried Flopson  
 Mrs  Pocket acted on the advice  and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap  while the other children played about it  This had lasted but a very short time  when Mrs  Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap  Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion  that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down   Under these circumstances  when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house  like a little flock of sheep  and Mr  Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance  I was not much surprised to find that Mr  Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face  and with his very gray hair disordered on his head  as if he didn t quite see his way to putting anything straight      Chapter XXIII  Mr  Pocket said he was glad to see me  and he hoped I was not sorry to see him  his perplexities and his very gray hair  and his manner seemed quite natural  I use the word natural  in the sense of its being unaffected; there was something comic in his distraught way  as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so  When he had talked with me a little  he said to Mrs  Pocket  with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows  which were black and handsome  looked up from her book  and said  absent state of mind  and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water  As the question had no bearing  near or remote  on any foregone or subsequent transaction  I consider it to have been thrown out  like her previous approaches  in general conversational condescension   I found out within a few hours  and may mention at once  that Mrs  Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight  who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody s determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives --I forget whose  if I ever knew --the Sovereign s  the Prime Minister s  the Lord Chancellor s  the Archbishop of Canterbury s  anybody s --and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact  I believe he had been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the point of the pen  in a desperate address engrossed on vellum  on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other  and for handing some Royal Personage either the trowel or the mortar  Be that as it may  he had directed Mrs  Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title  and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge   So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent  that she had grown up highly ornamental  but perfectly helpless and useless  With her character thus happily formed  in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr  Pocket: who was also in the first bloom of youth  and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack  or to roof himself in with a mitre  As his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time  he and Mrs  Pocket had taken Time by the forelock  when  to judge from its length  it would seem to have wanted cutting   and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent  The judicious parent  having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing  had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle  and had informed Mr  Pocket that his wife was in the ways of the world ever since  and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest  Still  Mrs  Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity  because she had not married a title; while Mr  Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach  because he had never got one   Mr  Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a pleasant one  and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sitting-room  He then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms  and introduced me to their occupants  by name Drummle and Startop  Drummle  an old-looking young man of a heavy order of architecture  was whistling  Startop  younger in years and appearance  was reading and holding his head  as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge   Both Mr  and Mrs  Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else s hands  that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there  until I found this unknown power to be the servants  It was a smooth way of going on  perhaps  in respect of saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive  for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking  and to keep a deal of company downstairs  They allowed a very liberal table to Mr  and Mrs  Pocket  yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen --always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence  for  before I had been there a week  a neighboring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted  wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby  This greatly distressed Mrs  Pocket  who burst into tears on receiving the note  and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbors couldn t mind their own business   By degrees I learnt  and chiefly from Herbert  that Mr  Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge  where he had distinguished himself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs  Pocket very early in life  he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder  After grinding a number of dull blades --of whom it was remarkable that their fathers  when influential  were always going to help him to preferment  but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone --he had wearied of that poor work and had come to London  Here  after gradually failing in loftier hopes  he had with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them  and had refurbished divers others for special occasions  and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction  and on such means  added to some very moderate private resources  still maintained the house I saw   Mr  and Mrs  Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody  blessed everybody  and shed smiles and tears on everybody  according to circumstances  This lady s name was Mrs  Coiler  and I had the honor of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation  She gave me to understand on the stairs  that it was a blow to dear Mrs  Pocket that dear Mr  Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him  That did not extend to me  she told me in a gush of love and confidence  at that time  I had known her something less than five minutes ; if they were all like Me  it would be quite another thing    said Mrs  Coiler  
 cry      said Mrs  Coiler  
 I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher s time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs  Pocket; but I said nothing  and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners   It came to my knowledge  through what passed between Mrs  Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork  spoon  glasses  and other instruments of self-destruction  that Drummle  whose Christian name was Bentley  was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy  It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs  Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles  and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book  if he ever had come at all  Drummle didn t say much  but in his limited way  he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow  he spoke as one of the elect  and recognized Mrs  Pocket as a woman and a sister  No one but themselves and Mrs  Coiler the toady neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation  and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last a long time  when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction  It was  in effect  that the cook had mislaid the beef  To my unutterable amazement  I now  for the first time  saw Mr  Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary  but which made no impression on anybody else  and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest  He laid down the carving-knife and fork --being engaged in carving  at the moment --put his two hands into his disturbed hair  and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it  When he had done this  and had not lifted himself up at all  he quietly went on with what he was about   Mrs  Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me  I liked it for a few moments  but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over  She had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left  which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop  who said very little to her   or upon Drummle  who said less   I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table   After dinner the children were introduced  and Mrs  Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes  noses  and legs --a sagacious way of improving their minds  There were four little girls  and two little boys  besides the baby who might have been either  and the baby s next successor who was as yet neither  They were brought in by Flopson and Millers  much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these  while Mrs  Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before  but didn t quite know what to make of them    said Flopson  
 Thus advised  Mrs  Pocket took it the other way  and got its head upon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion    said Flopson; 
 One of the little girls  a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others  stepped out of her place by me  and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying  and laughed  Then  all the children laughed  and Mr  Pocket  who in the meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair  laughed  and we all laughed and were glad   Flopson  by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll  then got it safely into Mrs  Pocket s lap  and gave it the nut-crackers to play with; at the same time recommending Mrs  Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes  and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same  Then  the two nurses left the room  and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner  and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gaming-table   I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs  Pocket s falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies  while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine  and  forgetting all about the baby on her lap  who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers  At length little Jane  perceiving its young brains to be imperilled  softly left her place  and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away  Mrs  Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time  and not approving of this  said to Jane --    lisped the little girl  
  retorted Mrs  Pocket  
 Mrs  Pocket s dignity was so crushing  that I felt quite abashed  as if I myself had done something to rouse it     said Mrs  Pocket  
  majestic glance at that innocent little offender   Mr  Pocket got his hands in his hair again  and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair  exclaimed to the elements  and became silent   We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on  A pause succeeded  during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane  who appeared to me to be the only member of the family  irrespective of servants  with whom it had any decided acquaintance    said Mrs  Pocket  
 The baby was the soul of honor  and protested with all its might  It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs  Pocket s arm  exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face  and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny  And it gained its point after all  for I saw it through the window within a few minutes  being nursed by little Jane   It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner-table  through Flopson s having some private engagement  and their not being anybody else s business  I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr  Pocket  which were exemplified in the following manner  Mr  Pocket  with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled  looked at them for some minutes  as if he couldn t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment  and why they hadn t been billeted by Nature on somebody else  Then  in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain questions --as why little Joe had that hole in his frill  who said  Pa  Flopson was going to mend it when she had time --and how little Fanny came by that whitlow  who said  Pa  Millers was going to poultice it when she didn t forget  Then  he melted into parental tenderness  and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as they went out  with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject   In the evening there was rowing on the river  As Drummle and Startop had each a boat  I resolved to set up mine  and to cut them both out  I was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts  but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames --not to say for other waters --I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs  and to whom I was introduced by my new allies  This practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith  If he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil  I doubt if he would have paid it   There was a supper-tray after we got home at night  and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves  but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence  Mr  Pocket was in good spirits  when a housemaid came in  and said   again    returned the housemaid  
 Hereupon  Mr  Pocket went out of the room  and we made the best of ourselves until he came back   countenance expressive of grief and despair   Mrs  Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion  and said     said Mrs  Pocket  
   said Mrs  Pocket  
 Mr  Pocket uttered a dismal groan   Pocket   There was a sofa where Mr  Pocket stood  and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator  Still in that attitude he said  with a hollow voice  bed and leave him      Chapter XXIV  After two or three days  when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several times  and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen  Mr  Pocket and I had a long talk together  He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself  for he referred to his having been told by Mr  Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession  and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could circumstances  I acquiesced  of course  knowing nothing to the contrary   He advised my attending certain places in London  for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted  and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies  He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me  and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his  Through his way of saying this  and much more to similar purpose  he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his compact with me  that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling mine with him  If he had shown indifference as a master  I have no doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no such excuse  and each of us did the other justice  Nor did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him--or anything but what was serious  honest  and good--in his tutor communication with me   When these points were settled  and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest  it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard s Inn  my life would be agreeably varied  while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert s society  Mr  Pocket did not object to this arrangement  but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it  it must be submitted to my guardian  I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense  so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr  Jaggers    said I  
  said Mr  Jaggers  with a short laugh  
 I said I didn t know how much    retorted Mr  Jaggers  
   This was such a great fall  that I said in discomfiture   his hands in his pockets  his head on one side  and his eyes on the wall behind me;    said Mr  Jaggers  
 I said I thought that would do handsomely   knitting his brows     said Mr  Jaggers; 
  knowing and contradictory toss of his head     said Mr  Jaggers  opening his office door  
 This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me  and that not of an agreeable kind  Mr  Jaggers never laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots  and  in poising himself on these boots  with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together  awaiting an answer  he sometimes caused the boots to creak  as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way  As he happened to go out now  and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative  I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr  Jaggers s manner   I looked surprised   Wemmick was at his desk  lunching--and crunching--on a dry hard biscuit; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth  as if he were posting them    said Wemmick  
 Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life  I said I supposed he was very skilful    said Wemmick  
office floor  to express that Australia was understood  for the purposes of the figure  to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe  paper   Then  I said I supposed he had a fine business  and Wemmick said  replied --   I accepted the offer  When Mr  Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post  and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe  the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat-collar like an iron-pigtail  we went upstairs  The house was dark and shabby  and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr  Jaggers s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years  In the front first floor  a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat-catcher--a large pale  puffed  swollen man--was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance  whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr  Jaggers s coffers   said Mr  Wemmick  as we came out  
room over that  a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair  his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy  was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes  whom Mr  Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling  and who would melt me anything I pleased --and who was in an excessive white-perspiration  as if he had been trying his art on himself  In a back room  a high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel  who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed  was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen  for Mr  Jaggers s own use   This was all the establishment  When we went downstairs again  Wemmick led me into my guardian s room  and said   caught my sight again   the horrible heads before bringing them down   upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve   affectionate apostrophe  by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it  and saying     returned Wemmick  
put down the cast  and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief    I asked  
  said Wemmick; 
Wemmick was again apostrophizing   Before putting his late friend on his shelf again  Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said   While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair  the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources  As he had shown no diffidence on the subject  I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question  when he stood before me  dusting his hands    he returned  
 When I had rendered homage to this light  he went on to say  in a friendly manner:--   I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality    said he; 
   said Wemmick  
   said Wemmick  
 I told him I would do so  with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened  As I was taking my departure  he asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr  Jaggers  For several reasons  and not least because I didn t clearly know what Mr  Jaggers would be found to be We dived into the City  and came up in a crowded police-court  where a blood-relation  in the murderous sense  of the deceased  with the fanciful taste in brooches  was standing at the bar  uncomfortably chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross-examination --I don t know which --and was striking her  and the bench  and everybody present  with awe  If anybody  of whatsoever degree  said a word that he didn t approve of  he instantly required to have it his finger  Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words  and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction  Which side he was on I couldn t make out  for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe  he was not on the side of the bench; for  he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided  quite convulsive under the table  by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day      Chapter XXV  Bentley Drummle  who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury  did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit  Heavy in figure  movement  and comprehension --in the sluggish complexion of his face  and in the large  awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room --he was idle  proud  niggardly  reserved  and suspicious  He came of rich people down in Somersetshire  who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead  Thus  Bentley Drummle had come to Mr  Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman  and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen   Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school  but he was devotedly attached to her  and admired her beyond measure  He had a woman s delicacy of feature  and was--me--him much more kindly than to Drummle  and that  even in the earliest evenings of our boating  he and I should pull homeward abreast of one another  conversing from boat to boat  while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone  under the overhanging banks and among the rushes  He would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature  even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water  when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid-stream   Herbert was my intimate companion and friend  I presented him with a half-share in my boat  which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often took me up to London  We used to walk between the two places at all hours  I have an affection for the road yet  though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then   formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope   When I had been in Mr  Pocket s family a month or two  Mr  and Mrs  Camilla turned up  Camilla was Mr  Pocket s sister  Georgiana  whom I had seen at Miss Havisham s on the same occasion  also turned up  She was a cousin --an indigestive single woman  who called her rigidity religion  and her liver love  These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment  As a matter of course  they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness  Towards Mr  Pocket  as a grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests  they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express  Mrs  Pocket they held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life  because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves   These were the surroundings among which I settled down  and applied myself to my education  I soon contracted expensive habits  and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books  There was no other merit in this  than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies  Between Mr  Pocket and Herbert I got on fast; and  with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted  and clear obstructions out of my road  I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less   I had not seen Mr  Wemmick for some weeks  when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening  He replied that it would give him much pleasure  and that he would expect me at the office at six o clock  Thither I went  and there I found him  putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck     said I  
  was Wemmick s reply  
a good one  old Briton  because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two  we could easily have done it Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop 
 I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl  until he added  politeness required   along     Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates  I answered   the word --the remark followed on the housekeeper understood;    returned Wemmick  
want to see the man who ll rob me why don t you do a stroke of business with me  Come; can t I tempt you    said Wemmick  
  I observed  
  said Wemmick  cutting me short  
 I was falling into meditation on my guardian s greatness  when Wemmick remarked:--     repeated Wemmick  
 At first with such discourse  and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature  did Mr  Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road  until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth   It appeared to be a collection of back lanes  ditches  and little gardens  and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement  Wemmick s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden  and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns    said Wemmick  
 I highly commended it  I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the queerest gothic windows  by far the greater part of them sham   and a gothic door almost too small to get in at    said Wemmick  
 The bridge was a plank  and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep  But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so  with a relish and not merely mechanically    said Wemmick  
 The piece of ordnance referred to  was mounted in a separate fortress  constructed of lattice-work  It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella    said Wemmick  
 I said  decidedly   Wemmick  smiling again  but seriously too  as he shook his head   Then  he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off  but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth  Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake  on whose margin the bower was raised  This piece of water  with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper  was of a circular form  and he had constructed a fountain in it  which  when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe  played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet   acknowledging my compliments   I expressed the readiness I felt  and we went into the castle  There we found  sitting by a fire  a very old man in a flannel coat: clean  cheerful  comfortable  and well cared for  but intensely deaf   and jocose way     said Wemmick  
 nodded as hard as I possibly could   contemplating the old man  with his hard face really softened;  giving him a tremendous one; 
giving him a still more tremendous one;  I tipped him several more  and he was in great spirits  We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls  and we sat down to our punch in the arbor; where Wemmick told me  as he smoked a pipe  that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection     said Wemmick  
   said Wemmick  
 Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request  The punch being very nice  we sat there drinking it and talking  until it was almost nine o clock  Wemmick then  as he laid down his pipe;  Proceeding into the Castle again  we found the Aged heating the poker  with expectant eyes  as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony  Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged  and repair to the battery  He took it  and went out  and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces  and made every glass and teacup in it ring  Upon this  the Aged--who I believe would have been blown out of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows--cried out exultingly  no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him   The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities  They were mostly of a felonious character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed  a distinguished razor or two  some locks of hair  and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation --upon which Mr  Wemmick set particular value as being  to use his own words  of china and glass  various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum  and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged  They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted  and which served  not only as the general sitting-room but as the kitchen too  if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob  and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack   There was a neat little girl in attendance  who looked after the Aged in the day  When she had laid the supper-cloth  the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress  and she withdrew for the night  The supper was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut  and though the pig might have been farther off  I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment  Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom  beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff  that when I lay down on my back in bed  it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night   Wemmick was up early in the morning  and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots  After that  he fell to gardening  and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged  and nodding at him in a most devoted manner  Our breakfast was as good as the supper  and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain  By degrees  Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along  and his mouth tightened into a post-office again  At last  when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar  he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged  had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger      Chapter XXVI  It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would  that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian s establishment with that of his cashier and clerk  My guardian was in his room  washing his hands with his scented soap  when I went into the office from Walworth; and he called me to him  and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive  come to  for I had no idea where he lived   and I believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission  that he replied  of remarking that he washed his clients off  as if he were a surgeon or a dentist  He had a closet in his room  fitted up for the purpose  which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer s shop  It had an unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door  and he would wash his hands  and wipe them and dry them all over this towel  whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room  When I and my friends repaired to him at six o clock next day  he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual  for we found him with his head butted into this closet  not only washing his hands  but laving his face and gargling his throat  And even when he had done all that  and had gone all round the jack-towel  he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on   There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street  who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence  that they gave it up for that day  As we walked along westward  he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets  and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he never otherwise recognized anybody  or took notice that anybody recognized him   He conducted us to Gerrard Street  Soho  to a house on the south side of that street  Rather a stately house of its kind  but dolefully in want of painting  and with dirty windows  He took out his key and opened the door  and we all went into a stone hall  bare  gloomy  and little used  So  up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor  There were carved garlands on the panelled walls  and as he stood among them giving us welcome  I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like   Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his dressing-room; the third  his bedroom  He told us that he held the whole house  but rarely used more of it than we saw  The table was comfortably laid--no silver in the service  of course--and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter  with a variety of bottles and decanters on it  and four dishes of fruit for dessert  I noticed throughout  that he kept everything under his own hand  and distributed everything himself   There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books  that they were about evidence  criminal law  criminal biography  trials  acts of Parliament  and such things  The furniture was all very solid and good  like his watch-chain  It had an official look  however  and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen  In a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too  and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work   As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now --for he and I had walked together --he stood on the hearth-rug  after ringing the bell  and took a searching look at them  To my surprise  he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle   the window      I replied; 
 Not making the least account of returned   He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way  but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him  I was looking at the two  when there came between me and them the housekeeper  with the first dish for the table   She was a woman of about forty  I supposed --but I may have thought her younger than she was  Rather tall  of a lithe nimble figure  extremely pale  with large faded eyes  and a quantity of streaming hair  I cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting  and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre  a night or two before  and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air  like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches  caldron   She set the dish on  touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready  and vanished  We took our seats at the round table  and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him  while Startop sat on the other  It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table  and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards  and then an equally choice bird  Sauces  wines  all the accessories we wanted  and all of the best  were given out by our host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the table  he always put them back again  Similarly  he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks  for each course  and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair  No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared  She set on every dish; and I always saw in her face  a face rising out of the caldron  Years afterwards  I made a dreadful likeness of that woman  by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room   Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper  both by her own striking appearance and by Wemmick s preparation  I observed that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian  and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him  hesitatingly  as if she dreaded his calling her back  and wanted him to speak when she was nigh  if he had anything to say  I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this  and a purpose of always holding her in suspense   Dinner went off gayly  and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects  I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us  For myself  I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure  and to patronize Herbert  and to boast of my great prospects  before I quite knew that I had opened my lips  It was so with all of us  but with no one more than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest  was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off   It was not then  but when we had got to the cheese  that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats  and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his  Drummle upon this  informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company  and that as to skill he was more than our master  and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff  By some invisible agency  my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was  and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner   Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian  taking no heed of her  but with the side of his face turned from her  was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle  that  to me  was quite inexplicable  Suddenly  he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper s  like a trap  as she stretched it across the table  So suddenly and smartly did he do this  that we all stopped in our foolish contention    said Mr  Jaggers  
 Her entrapped hand was on the table  but she had already put her other hand behind her waist  attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him   determination to show it    she again murmured  
 at the opposite side of the room   He took his hand from hers  and turned that wrist up on the table  She brought her other hand from behind her  and held the two out side by side  The last wrist was much disfigured --deeply scarred and scarred across and across  When she held her hands out she took her eyes from Mr  Jaggers  and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession   with his forefinger   While he said these words in a leisurely  critical style  she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat  The moment he ceased  she looked at him again  Jaggers  giving her a slight nod; putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter  filled his glass and passed round the wine    said he  
 If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more  it perfectly succeeded  In a sulky triumph  Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us  in a more and more offensive degree  until he became downright intolerable  Through all his stages  Mr  Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest  He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr  Jaggers s wine   In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink  and I know we talked too much  We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle s  to the effect that we were too free with our money  It led to my remarking  with more zeal than discretion  that it came with a bad grace from him  to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before    retorted Drummle; 
  said I  
  retorted Drummle  
  I went on  meaning to be very severe  
  said Drummle  
   repeated Drummle  
 This was so very aggravating--the more especially as I found myself making no way against his surly obtuseness--that I said  disregarding Herbert s efforts to check me --   growled Drummle  And I think he added in a lower growl  that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves    said I  
 Drummle laughed outright  and sat laughing in our faces  with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that it was quite true  and that he despised us as asses all   Hereupon Startop took him in hand  though with a much better grace than I had shown  and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable  Startop  being a lively  bright young fellow  and Drummle being the exact opposite  the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront  He now retorted in a coarse  lumpish way  and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh  Resenting this little success more than anything  Drummle  without any threat or warning  pulled his hands out of his pockets  dropped his round shoulders  swore  took up a large glass  and would have flung it at his adversary s head  but for our entertainer s dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose   hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain   On this hint we all rose to depart  Before we got to the street door  Startop was cheerily calling Drummle happened  But the old boy was so far from responding  that he would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I  who remained in town  saw them going down the street on opposite sides; Startop leading  and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses  much as he was wont to follow in his boat   As the door was not yet shut  I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment  and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian  I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots  already hard at it  washing his hands of us   I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred  and that I hoped he would not blame me much   water-drops;  He had turned towards me now  and was shaking his head  and blowing  and towelling himself    said I--
  my guardian assented; 
 Looking out of the towel  he caught my eye   festoon of towel  and towelling away at his two ears    In about a month after that  the Spider s time with Mr  Pocket was up for good  and  to the great relief of all the house but Mrs  Pocket  he went home to the family hole      Chapter XXVII   is going to London in company with Mr  Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you  He would call at Barnard s Hotel Tuesday morning at nine o clock  when if not agreeable please leave word  Your poor sister is much the same as when you left  We talk of you in the kitchen every night  and wonder what you are saying and doing  If now considered in the light of a liberty  excuse it for the love of poor old days  No more  dear Mr  Pip  from your ever obliged  and affectionate servant     I received this letter by the post on Monday morning  and therefore its appointment was for next day  Let me confess exactly with what feelings I looked forward to Joe s coming   Not with pleasure  though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with considerable disturbance  some mortification  and a keen sense of incongruity  If I could have kept him away by paying money  I certainly would have paid money  My greatest reassurance was that he was coming to Barnard s Inn  not to Hammersmith  and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummle s way  I had little objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father  for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle  whom I held in contempt  So  throughout life  our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise   I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other  and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard proved to be  By this time  the rooms were vastly different from what I had found them  and I enjoyed the honor of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring upholsterer  I had got on so fast of late  that I had even started a boy in boots --top boots --in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said to pass my days  For  after I had made the monster  out of the refuse of my washerwoman s family   and had clothed him with a blue coat  canary waistcoat  white cravat  creamy breeches  and the boots already mentioned  I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence   This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in the hall   it was two feet square  as charged for floorcloth   and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought Joe would like  While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate  I had an odd half-provoked sense of suspicion upon me  that if Joe had been coming to see him  he wouldn t have been quite so brisk about it   However  I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe  and I got up early in the morning  and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance  Unfortunately the morning was drizzly  and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window  like some weak giant of a Sweep   As the time approached I should have liked to run away  but the Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall  and presently I heard Joe on the staircase  I knew it was Joe  by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs  --his state boots being always too big for him --and by the time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his ascent  When at last he stopped outside our door  I could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name  and I afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole  Finally he gave a faint single rap  and Pepper--such was the compromising name of the avenging boy--announced done wiping his feet  and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat  but at last he came in     With his good honest face all glowing and shining  and his hat put down on the floor between us  he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down  as if I had been the last-patented Pump    But Joe  taking it up carefully with both hands  like a bird s-nest with eggs in it  wouldn t hear of parting with that piece of property  and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way    said Joe  
   said Joe  
 All this time  still with both hands taking great care of the bird s-nest   Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room  and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown     said Joe  lowering his voice  
bird s-nest under his left arm for the moment  and groping in it for an egg with his right;  I took what Joe gave me  and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a small metropolitan theatre  announcing the first appearance  in that very week  of      said Joe  
Amen!
Joe  lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone   A ghost-seeing effect in Joe s own countenance informed me that Herbert had entered the room  So  I presented Joe to Herbert  who held out his hand; but Joe backed from it  and held on by the bird s-nest    said Joe  
eye fell on the Avenger  who was putting some toast on table  and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family  that I frowned it down and confused him more--said Joe  confidentially   Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling-place  and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat --as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting place --and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimney-piece  from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals   presided of a morning    said Joe  stiff from head to foot  
    Here Joe s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece  and he started out of his chair and picked it up  and fitted it to the same exact spot  As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon    as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came  appearance of mingled wisdom  relief  and strict impartiality      said Joe  
an explanatory manner   I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word  mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know  into a perfect Chorus  but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat  which was toppling  Indeed  it demanded from him a constant attention  and a quickness of eye and hand  very like that exacted by wicket-keeping  He made extraordinary play with it  and showed the greatest skill; now  rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now  merely stopping it midway  beating it up  and humoring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall  before he felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the slop-basin  where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it   As to his shirt-collar  and his coat-collar  they were perplexing to reflect upon --insoluble mysteries both  Why should a man scrape himself to that extent  before he could consider himself full dressed  Why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes  Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation  with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table  and dropped so much more than he ate  and pretended that he hadn t dropped it; that I was heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City   I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault  and that if I had been easier with Joe  Joe would have been easier with me  I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head     I interrupted  pettishly  
 Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach  Utterly preposterous as his cravat was  and as his collars were  I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look    resumed Joe  
 said Joe  with his old air of lucid exposition  
 I was so unwilling to see the look again  that I made no remonstrance against this tone    pursued Joe  
Pip  and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; said Joe  going down a new track    his head    rolled his eyes at the ceiling      he were making his will   I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe  I hope one remote cause of its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his errand  I should have given him more encouragement    pursued Joe  
     Our eyes met  and all the me his hand    I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him  The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven  He touched me gently on the forehead  and went out  As soon as I could recover myself sufficiently  I hurried out after him and looked for him in the neighboring streets; but he was gone      Chapter XXVIII  It was clear that I must repair to our town next day  and in the first flow of my repentance  it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe s  But  when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow s coach  and had been down to Mr  Pocket s and back  I was not by any means convinced on the last point  and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar  I should be an inconvenience at Joe s; I was not expected  and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss Havisham s  and she was exacting and mightn t like it  All other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers  and with such pretences did I cheat myself  Surely a curious thing  That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else s manufacture is reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money! An obliging stranger  under pretence of compactly folding up my bank-notes for security s sake  abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine  when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!  Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar  my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger  It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the Blue Boar s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor s shop  and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb s boy  On the other hand  Trabb s boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or  reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he could be  might hoot him in the High Street  My patroness  too  might hear of him  and not approve  On the whole  I resolved to leave the Avenger behind   It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place  and  as winter had now come round  I should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark  Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was two o clock  I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare  attended by the Avenger --if I may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it   At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards by stage-coach  As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers  and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof  I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert  meeting me in the yard  came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me  But I had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word       said Herbert  
 They had been treating their guard  I suppose  for they had a gaoler with them  and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands  The two convicts were handcuffed together  and had irons on their legs --irons of a pattern that I knew well  They wore the dress that I likewise knew well  Their keeper had a brace of pistols  and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good understanding with them  and stood with them beside him  looking on at the putting-to of the horses  rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment  and he the Curator  One was a taller and stouter man than the other  and appeared as a matter of course  according to the mysterious ways of the world  both convict and free  to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes  His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes  and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his half-closed eye at one glance  There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night  and who had brought me down with his invisible gun!  It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life  He looked across at me  and his eye appraised my watch-chain  and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict  and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle  and looked at something else  The great numbers on their backs  as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface  as if they were lower animals; their ironed legs  apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them  as Herbert had said  a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle   But this was not the worst of it  It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London  and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman  Hereupon  a choleric gentleman  who had taken the fourth place on that seat  flew into a most violent passion  and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company  and that it was poisonous  and pernicious  and infamous  and shameful  and I don t know what else  At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient  and we were all preparing to get up  and the prisoners had come over with their keeper --bringing with them that curious flavor of bread-poultice  baize  rope-yarn  and hearthstone  which attends the convict presence   passenger;   growled the convict I had recognized  
  said the other  gruffly  
nuts  and spitting the shells about --As I really think I should have liked to do myself  if I had been in their place and so despised   At length  it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman  and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind  So he got into his place  still making complaints  and the keeper got into the place next him  and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could  and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head   blessed fortune it was  that he had found another name for me than Pip   It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict s breathing  not only on the back of my head  but all along my spine  The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid  it set my very teeth on edge  He seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man  and to make more noise in doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side  in my shrinking endeavors to fend him off   The weather was miserably raw  and the two cursed the cold  It made us all lethargic before we had gone far  and when we had left the Half-way House behind  we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent  I dozed off  myself  in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him  and how it could best be done  In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses  I woke in a fright and took the question up again   But I must have lost it longer than I had thought  since  although I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps  I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us  Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind  the convicts were closer to me than before  The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious  were the words of my own thought     returned the other  
  said the other  with a bitter curse upon the cold  
    resumed the convict I had recognized --
  growled the other  
      They both execrated the place in very strong language  and gradually growled themselves out  and had nothing left to say   After overhearing this dialogue  I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway  but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity  Indeed  I was not only so changed in the course of nature  but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced  that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help  Still  the coincidence of our being together on the coach  was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me  in his hearing  with my name  For this reason  I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town  and put myself out of his hearing  This device I executed successfully  My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before me  got down after it  and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement  As to the convicts  they went their way with the coach  and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river  In my fancy  I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed stairs --again heard the gruff like and order to dogs --again saw the wicked Noah s Ark lying out on the black water   I could not have said what I was afraid of  for my fear was altogether undefined and vague  but there was great fear upon me  As I walked on to the hotel  I felt that a dread  much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition  made me tremble  I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape  and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood   The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty  and I had not only ordered my dinner there  but had sat down to it  before the waiter knew me  As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory  he asked me if he should send Boots for Mr  Pumblechook    said I  
 The waiter  it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the Commercials  on the day when I was bound  appeared surprised  and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way  that I took it up and read this paragraph:--  Our readers will learn  not altogether without interest  in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighborhood  what a theme  by the way  for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY  the poet of our columns!  that the youth s earliest patron  companion  and friend  was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade  and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street  It is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor of our young Telemachus  for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter s fortunes  Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes  We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp  VERB  SAP   I entertain a conviction  based upon large experience  that if in the days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole  I should have met somebody there  wandering Esquimaux or civilized man  who would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes      Chapter XXIX  Betimes in the morning I was up and out  It was too early yet to go to Miss Havisham s  so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham s side of town --which was not Joe s side; I could go there to-morrow --thinking about my patroness  and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me   She had adopted Estella  she had as good as adopted me  and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together  She reserved it for me to restore the desolate house  admit the sunshine into the dark rooms  set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing  tear down the cobwebs  destroy the vermin --in short  do all the shining deeds of the young Knight of romance  and marry the Princess  I had stopped to look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls  blocked windows  and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons  as if with sinewy old arms  had made up a rich attractive mystery  of which I was the hero  Estella was the inspiration of it  and the heart of it  of course  But  though she had taken such strong possession of me  though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her  though her influence on my boyish life and character had been all-powerful  I did not  even that romantic morning  invest her with any attributes save those she possessed  I mention this in this place  of a fixed purpose  because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth  According to my experience  the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true  The unqualified truth is  that when I loved Estella with the love of a man  I loved her simply because I found her irresistible  Once for all; I knew to my sorrow  often and often  if not always  that I loved her against reason  against promise  against peace  against hope  against happiness  against all discouragement that could be  Once for all; I loved her none the less because I knew it  and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection   I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time  When I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand  I turned my back upon the gate  while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet  I heard the side-door open  and steps come across the courtyard; but I pretended not to hear  even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges   Being at last touched on the shoulder  I started and turned  I started much more naturally then  to find myself confronted by a man in a sober gray dress  The last man I should have expected to see in that place of porter at Miss Havisham s door     I entered and he swung it  and locked it  and took the key out  said he  facing round  after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house     he retorted  
   I was not so sure of that  I had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind  while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement  up my legs and arms  to my face    round him with an air of injury   I asked him how long he had left Gargery s forge    he replied  
   said he  dryly  
 By this time we had come to the house  where I found his room to be one just within the side-door  with a little window in it looking on the courtyard  In its small proportions  it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris  Certain keys were hanging on the wall  to which he now added the gate key; and his patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess  The whole had a slovenly  confined  and sleepy look  like a cage for a human dormouse; while he  looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window  looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up --as indeed he was    I remarked; 
  said he; 
 My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the chimney-piece  and his eye had followed mine    said I  not desirous of more conversation  
 shaking himself;    Upon that  I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in my thick boots  and he made his bell sound  At the end of the passage  while the bell was still reverberating  I found Sarah Pocket  who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me    said she  
   said Sarah  with a dismal shake of the head; 
 Tolerably  for I had gone up the staircase in the dark  many a time  I ascended it now  in lighter boots than of yore  and tapped in my old way at the door of Miss Havisham s room  immediately;  She was in her chair near the old table  in the old dress  with her two hands crossed on her stick  her chin resting on them  and her eyes on the fire  Sitting near her  with the white shoe  that had never been worn  in her hand  and her head bent as she looked at it  was an elegant lady whom I had never seen   or up;  She looked up at me suddenly  only moving her eyes  and repeated in a grimly playful manner --    said I  rather at a loss  
  The lady whom I had never seen before  lifted up her eyes and looked archly at me  and then I saw that the eyes were Estella s eyes  But she was so much changed  was so much more beautiful  so much more womanly  in all things winning admiration  had made such wonderful advance  that I seemed to have made none  I fancied  as I looked at her  that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again  O the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me  and the inaccessibility that came about her!  She gave me her hand  I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in seeing her again  and about my having looked forward to it  for a long  long time   greedy look  and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between them  as a sign to me to sit down there    interrupted   I said confusedly that that was long ago  and that I knew no better then  and the like  Estella smiled with perfect composure  and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right  and of her having been very disagreeable     hair   Estella laughed  and looked at the shoe in her hand  and laughed again  and looked at me  and put the shoe down  She treated me as a boy still  but she lured me on   We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me  and I learnt that she had but just come home from France  and that she was going to London  Proud and wilful as of old  she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of nature--or I thought so--to separate them from her beauty  Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood --from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and Joe --from all those visions that had raised her face in the glowing fire  struck it out of the iron on the anvil  extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge  and flit away  In a word  it was impossible for me to separate her  in the past or in the present  from the innermost life of my life   It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day  and return to the hotel at night  and to London to-morrow  When we had conversed for a while  Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden: on our coming in by and by  she said  I should wheel her about a little  as in times of yore   So  Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman  now Herbert; I  trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she  quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine  As we drew near to the place of encounter  she stopped and said --     she replied  in an incidental and forgetful way  
    I made the admission with reluctance  for it seemed to have a boyish look  and she already treated me more than enough like a boy      she added  in a haughty tone; 
 In my conscience  I doubt very much whether I had any lingering intention left of going to see Joe; but if I had  this observation put it to flight   Estella  with a slight wave of her hand  signifying in the fighting times    The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side  and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hers  made a contrast that I strongly felt  It would have rankled in me more than it did  if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her   The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease  and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice  we came out again into the brewery yard  I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her walking on the casks  that first old day  and she said  with a cold and careless look in that direction  come out of the house and given me my meat and drink  and she said   
 said I  
she  and shook her head and looked about her  I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least  made me cry again  inwardly --and that is the sharpest crying of all   beautiful woman might   I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of doubting that  That I knew better  That there could be no such beauty without it   Estella   What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me  Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham  No  In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children  from grown person with whom they have been much associated and secluded  and which  when childhood is passed  will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite different  And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham  I looked again  and though she was still looking at me  the suggestion was gone   What was it   smooth  as with a darkening of her face; me as I opened my lips   In another moment we were in the brewery  so long disused  and she pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same first day  and told me she remembered to have been up there  and to have seen me standing scared below  As my eyes followed her white hand  again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me  My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm  Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone   What was it    asked Estella  
 it off    Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground  She held it in one hand now  and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked  We walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more  and it was all in bloom for me  If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew  it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance   There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me; we were of nearly the same age  though of course the age told for more in her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her beauty and her manner gave her  tormented me in the midst of my delight  and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another  Wretched boy!  At last we went back into the house  and there I heard  with surprise  that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business  and would come back to dinner  The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out  and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me   It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past  when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast  But  in the funereal room  with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her  Estella looked more bright and beautiful than before  and I was under stronger enchantment   The time so melted away  that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand  and Estella left us to prepare herself  We had stopped near the centre of the long table  and Miss Havisham  with one of her withered arms stretched out of the chair  rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth  As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door  Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her  with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful   Then  Estella being gone and we two left alone  she turned to me  and said in a whisper --    She drew an arm round my neck  and drew my head close down to hers as she sat in the chair   Before I could answer  if I could have answered so difficult a question at all  she repeated   Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these words  I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her    She said the word often enough  and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of love--despair--revenge--dire death--it could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse    said she  in the same hurried passionate whisper  
 When she came to that  and to a wild cry that followed that  I caught her round the waist  For she rose up in the chair  in her shroud of a dress  and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead   All this passed in a few seconds  As I drew her down into her chair  I was conscious of a scent that I knew  and turning  saw my guardian in the room   He always carried  I have not yet mentioned it  I think  a pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions  which was of great value to him in his profession  I have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose  and then pausing  as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself  that the self-committal has followed directly  quite as a matter of course  When I saw him in the room he had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands  and was looking at us  On meeting my eye  he said plainly  by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude  its right use with wonderful effect   Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I  and was  like everybody else  afraid of him  She made a strong attempt to compose herself  and stammered that he was as punctual as ever    he repeated  coming up to us  
 I told him when I had arrived  and how Miss Havisham had wished me to come and see Estella  To which he replied  Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him  with one of his large hands  and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets   he came to a stop        interposed Miss Havisham  much to my relief  
 He complied  and we groped our way down the dark stairs together  While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back  he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat and drink; offering me a breadth of choice  as usual  between a hundred times and once   I considered  and said    he retorted  with a frowning smile  
  said I  
  said he  
     This brought us to the dinner-table  where she and Sarah Pocket awaited us  Mr  Jaggers presided  Estella sat opposite to him  I faced my green and yellow friend  We dined very well  and were waited on by a maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings  but who  for anything I know  had been in that mysterious house the whole time  After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian  he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage   and the two ladies left us   Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr  Jaggers under that roof I never saw elsewhere  even in him  He kept his very looks to himself  and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella s face once during dinner  When she spoke to him  he listened  and in due course answered  but never looked at her  that I could see  On the other hand  she often looked at him  with interest and curiosity  if not distrust  but his face never showed the least consciousness  Throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower  by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here  again  he showed no consciousness  and even made it appear that he extorted--and even did extort  though I don t know how--those references out of my innocent self   And when he and I were left alone together  he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed  that really was too much for me  He cross-examined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand  He held it between himself and the candle  tasted the port  rolled it in his mouth  swallowed it  looked at his glass again  smelt the port  tried it  drank it  filled again  and cross-examined the glass again  until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage  Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything  he looked at me with his glass in his hand  and rolling his wine about in his mouth  as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use  for he couldn t answer   I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness  and perhaps tearing off her cap --which was a very hideous one  in the nature of a muslin mop --and strewing the ground with her hair --which assuredly had never grown on her head  She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss Havisham s room  and we four played at whist  In the interval  Miss Havisham  in a fantastic way  had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing-table into Estella s hair  and about her bosom and arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows  and raise them a little  when her loveliness was before him  with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it   Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody  and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands  before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased  I say nothing; nor  of the feeling that I had  respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago  What I suffered from  was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella  It was not that I knew I could never bear to speak to him about her  that I knew I could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her  that I knew I could never bear to see him wash his hands of her; it was  that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him --it was  that my feelings should be in the same place with him --that  was the agonizing circumstance   We played until nine o clock  and then it was arranged that when Estella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her  and touched her and left her   My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine  Far into the night  Miss Havisham s words  my ears  I adapted them for my own repetition  and said to my pillow  gratitude came upon me  that she should be destined for me  once the blacksmith s boy  Then I thought if she were  as I feared  by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet  when would she begin to be interested in me  When should I awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now   Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions  But I never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe  because I knew she would be contemptuous of him  It was but a day gone  and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried  God forgive me! soon dried      Chapter XXX  After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar in the morning  I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick s being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham s  comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head  quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man  and he listened in a satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick   he observed  when I had concluded  
for a little delay  and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with  pocket-handkerchief-point  with perfect confidence;  As we were going back together to London by the midday coach  and as I breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my cup  this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk  and that I would go on along the London road while Mr  Jaggers was occupied  if he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when overtaken  I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast  By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook s premises  I got round into the High Street again  a little beyond that pitfall  and felt myself in comparative security   It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more  and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after  One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me  that they might turn  as if they had forgotten something  and pass me face to face --on which occasions I don t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing it  or I of not seeing it  Still my position was a distinguished one  and I was not at all dissatisfied with it  until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant  Trabb s boy   Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress  I beheld Trabb s boy approaching  lashing himself with an empty blue bag  Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me  and would be most likely to quell his evil mind  I advanced with that expression of countenance  and was rather congratulating myself on my success  when suddenly the knees of Trabb s boy smote together  his hair uprose  his cap fell off  he trembled violently in every limb  staggered out into the road  and crying to the populace  contrition  occasioned by the dignity of my appearance  As I passed him  his teeth loudly chattered in his head  and with every mark of extreme humiliation  he prostrated himself in the dust   This was a hard thing to bear  but this was nothing  I had not advanced another two hundred yards when  to my inexpressible terror  amazement  and indignation  I again beheld Trabb s boy approaching  He was coming round a narrow corner  His blue bag was slung over his shoulder  honest industry beamed in his eyes  a determination to proceed to Trabb s with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait  With a shock he became aware of me  and was severely visited as before; but this time his motion was rotatory  and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted  and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy  His sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators  and I felt utterly confounded   I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office  when I again beheld Trabb s boy shooting round by a back way  This time  he was entirely changed  He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat  and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street  attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed  with a wave of his hand  Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb s boy  when passing abreast of me  he pulled up his shirt-collar  twined his side-hair  stuck an arm akimbo  and smirked extravagantly by  wriggling his elbows and body  and drawling to his attendants  to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows  as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith  culminated the disgrace with which I left the town  and was  so to speak  ejected by it into the open country   But unless I had taken the life of Trabb s boy on that occasion  I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure  To have struggled with him in the street  or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart s best blood  would have been futile and degrading  Moreover  he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an invulnerable and dodging serpent who  when chased into a corner  flew out again between his captor s legs  scornfully yelping  I wrote  however  to Mr  Trabb by next day s post  to say that Mr  Pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society  as to employ a boy who excited Loathing in every respectable mind   The coach  with Mr  Jaggers inside  came up in due time  and I took my box-seat again  and arrived in London safe --but not sound  for my heart was gone  As soon as I arrived  I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe  as reparation for not having gone myself   and then went on to Barnard s Inn   I found Herbert dining on cold meat  and delighted to welcome me back  Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the dinner  I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum  As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the hall  which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole  I sent him to the Play  A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded  than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him employment  So mean is extremity  that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park corner to see what o clock it was   Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender  I said to Herbert    he returned  
  said I  
 Herbert crossed his feet  looked at the fire with his head on one side  and having looked at it in vain for some time  looked at me because I didn t go on    said I  laying my hand upon his knee  
 Instead of being transfixed  Herbert replied in an easy matter-of-course way     said Herbert  
     light    said Herbert  
 I shook my head gloomily  said I     I returned  
 and clapping his hand on the back of mine-- I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character  On the whole  I by no means recognized the analysis  but thought it not worth disputing    I went on  
  fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him    there  more or less  though no doubt most since yesterday    Herbert replied  in his gay  hopeful way  
 I said I could not deny that this was a strong point  I said it  people often do so  in such cases  like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice;--as if I wanted to deny it!   said Herbert  
 cheery ways    said Herbert  
Jaggers would not be in it    said he  
very much in earnest --   I turned my head aside  for  with a rush and a sweep  like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea  a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when I left the forge  when the mists were solemnly rising  and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post  smote upon my heart again  There was silence between us for a little while   instead of silent    said I  with my head still turned away  
     been asleep  and stirring the fire   So he went round the room and shook the curtains out  put the chairs in their places  tidied the books and so forth that were lying about  looked into the hall  peeped into the letter-box  shut the door  and came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down  nursing his left leg in both arms      This was such a singular question  that I asked him in return    said Herbert  
   said Herbert; 
 I assured him of my keeping the secret  and begged to be favored with further particulars  He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength      curiously crestfallen and meek  since we entered on the interesting theme      for I had intended my question to apply to his means  then laughing heartily  Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner     returned Herbert  
 When he had once more laughed heartily  he became meek again  and told me that the moment he began to realize Capital  it was his intention to marry this young lady  He added as a self-evident proposition  engendering low spirits   As we contemplated the fire  and as I thought what a difficult vision to realize this same Capital sometimes was  I put my hands in my pockets  A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention  I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe  relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown   I involuntarily added aloud  
 This changed the subject in an instant  and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play  So  when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means  and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented to her  and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence  we blew out our candles  made up our fire  locked our door  and issued forth in quest of Mr  Wopsle and Denmark      Chapter XXXI  On our arrival in Denmark  we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table  holding a Court  The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor  a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life  and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs  and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance  My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart  with folded arms  and I could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable   Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded  The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease  but to have taken it with him to the tomb  and to have brought it back  The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon  to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring  and that too  with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality  It was this  I conceive  which led to the Shade s being advised by the gallery to extremely ill  It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit  that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance  it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall  This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively  The Queen of Denmark  a very buxom lady  though no doubt historically brazen  was considered by the public to have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal  as if she had a gorgeous toothache   her waist being encircled by another  and each of her arms by another  so that she was openly mentioned as inconsistent  representing himself  as it were in one breath  as an able seaman  a strolling actor  a grave-digger  a clergyman  and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match  on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged  This gradually led to a want of toleration for him  and even--on his being detected in holy orders  and declining to perform the funeral service--to the general indignation taking the form of nuts  Lastly  Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness  that when  in course of time  she had taken off her white muslin scarf  folded it up  and buried it  a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery  growled  keeping   Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect  Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or state a doubt  the public helped him out with it  As for example; on the question whether  twas nobler in the mind to suffer  some roared yes  and some no  and some inclining to both opinions said fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven  he was encouraged with loud cries of disordered  its disorder expressed  according to usage  by one very neat fold in the top  which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron   a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg  and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him  On his taking the recorders --very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door --he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia  When he recommended the player not to saw the air thus  the sulky man said  peals of laughter greeted Mr  Wopsle on every one of these occasions   But his greatest trials were in the churchyard  which had the appearance of a primeval forest  with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house on one side  and a turnpike gate on the other  Mr  Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak  being descried entering at the turnpike  the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way  I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr  Wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull  after moralizing over it  without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast; but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment  black box with the lid tumbling open   was the signal for a general joy  which was much enhanced by the discovery  among the bearers  of an individual obnoxious to identification  The joy attended Mr  Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave  and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen-table  and had died by inches from the ankles upward   We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr  Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in  Therefore we had sat  feeling keenly for him  but laughing  nevertheless  from ear to ear  I laughed in spite of myself all the time  the whole thing was so droll; and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in Mr  Wopsle s elocution --not for old associations  sake  I am afraid  but because it was very slow  very dreary  very uphill and downhill  and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything  When the tragedy was over  and he had been called for and hooted  I said to Herbert   We made all the haste we could downstairs  but we were not quick enough either  Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow  who caught my eyes as we advanced  and said  when we came up with him --   Identity of Mr  Pip and friend confessed    said the man  
  I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear  
  said I  
 asked   I don t know what he had looked like  except a funeral; with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon  that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office  But I said he had looked very nice    said our conductor  
 I modestly assented  and we all fell through a little dirty swing door  into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it  Here Mr  Wopsle was divesting himself of his Danish garments  and here there was just room for us to look at him over one another s shoulders  by keeping the packing-case door  or lid  wide open    said Mr  Wopsle  
 Meanwhile  Mr  Waldengarver  in a frightful perspiration  was trying to get himself out of his princely sables   property   With that  he went upon his knees  and began to flay his victim; who  on the first stocking coming off  would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair  but for there being no room to fall anyhow   I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play  But then  Mr  Waldengarver looked up at us complacently  and said --   Herbert said from behind  at the same time poking me   said  Waldengarver  almost  if not quite  with patronage   Herbert said from behind  again poking me   said boldly  as if I had originated it  and must beg to insist upon it   with an air of dignity  in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time  and holding on by the seat of the chair   his knees  wafers! Mr  Waldengarver smiled at me  as much as to say  and then said aloud  
 Herbert and I said together  O  no doubt they would improve    said Mr  Waldengarver  
 We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man  I added    said Mr  Wopsle  
  Mr  Wopsle shut his eyes  and opened them again; performing both ceremonies very slowly   Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr  Wopsle if he had been in despair  I was so sorry for him as it was  that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put on --which jostled us out at the doorway --to ask Herbert what he thought of having him home to supper  Herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so; therefore I invited him  and he went to Barnard s with us  wrapped up to the eyes  and we did our best for him  and he sat until two o clock in the morning  reviewing his success and developing his plans  I forget in detail what they were  but I have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama  and to end with crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope   Miserably I went to bed after all  and miserably thought of Estella  and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled  and that I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert s Clara  or play Hamlet to Miss Havisham s Ghost  before twenty thousand people  without knowing twenty words of it      Chapter XXXII  One day when I was busy with my books and Mr  Pocket  I received a note by the post  the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter; for  though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed  I divined whose hand it was  It had no set beginning  as Dear Mr  Pip  or Dear Pip  or Dear Sir  or Dear Anything  but ran thus:--  Yours  ESTELLA 
Halloa  Mr  Pip 
this was your beat Both flourishing thankye 
He s in wonderful feather  He ll be eighty-two next birthday  I have a notion of firing eighty-two times  if the neighborhood shouldn t complain  and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure  However  this is not London talk  Where do you think I am going to To the office

Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder  Is he going to make it manslaughter  or what s he going to make of it Why don t you ask him 
O yes  I dare say!
Now  that s the way with them here  Mr  Pip

thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high  He s always so high  His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities  That Colonel durst no more take leave of him  than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case  Then  between his height and them  he slips in his subordinate --don t you see --and so he has  em  soul and body I am going to Richmond 
two Richmonds  one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire  and that mine is the Surrey Richmond  The distance is ten miles  I am to have a carriage  and you are to take me  This is my purse  and you are to pay my charges out of it  O  you must take the purse! We have no choice  you and I  but to obey our instructions  We are not free to follow our own devices  you and I little are to take care of me the while Some tea for the lady 
Where are you going to  at Richmond 
I am going to live 
who has the power--or says she has--of taking me about  and introducing me  and showing people to me and showing me to people I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration 
Yes  I suppose so 
you were some one else Where did you learn how I speak of others  Come  come 
must talk in my own way  How do you thrive with Mr  Pocket I live quite pleasantly there; at least--
At least 
As pleasantly as I could anywhere  away from you 
You silly boy 
nonsense  Your friend Mr  Matthew  I believe  is superior to the rest of his family Very superior indeed  He is nobody s enemy--
Don t add but his own 
man  But he really is disinterested  and above small jealousy and spite  I have heard I am sure I have every reason to say so 
You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people 
insinuations to your disadvantage  They watch you  misrepresent you  write letters about you  anonymous sometimes   and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives  You can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for you They do me no harm  I hope 
harm No  no you may be sure of that 
I laugh because they fail  O  those people with Miss Havisham  and the tortures they undergo!It is not easy for even you 
it gives me to see those people thwarted  or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous  For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby  I was  You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you  suppressed and defenceless  under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing  I had  You did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night  I did Two things I can tell you 
proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone  you may set your mind at rest that these people never will--never would  in hundred years--impair your ground with Miss Havisham  in any particular  great or small  Second  I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain  and there is my hand upon it You ridiculous boy

care that I have some tea  and you are to take me to Richmond What place is that 
Wretches!
Mr  Jaggers 
than any man in London He is more in the secrets of every place  I think 
You have been accustomed to see him often  I suppose 
I can remember  But I know him no better now  than I did before I could speak plainly  What is your own experience of him  Do you advance with him Once habituated to his distrustful manner 
well Are you intimate 
I have dined with him at his private house 
I fancy 
that must be a curious place 
It is a curious place 
God forbid!
are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned some station  though not averse to increasing her income I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon 
It is a part of Miss Havisham s plans for me  Pip 
her regularly and report how I go on --I and the jewels --for they are nearly all mine now ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove go to Lloyd s
For

My dear Herbert  we are getting on badly 
My dear Handel

let us look into our affairs 
Memorandum of Pip s debts

I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now  Biddy dear 
Oh! I can t do so  Mr  Pip 
going to her to-morrow  I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr  Gargery  together  until he settles down How are you going to live  Biddy  If you want any mo--
How am I going to live 
the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here  I can be well recommended by all the neighbors  and I hope I can be industrious and patient  and teach myself while I teach others  You know  Mr  Pip schools are not like the old  but I learnt a good deal from you after that time  and have had time since then to improve I think you would always improve  Biddy  under any circumstances 
Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature 
I have not heard the particulars of my sister s death  Biddy 
states--though they had got better of late  rather than worse--for four days  when she came out of it in the evening  just at tea-time  and said quite plainly   Joe   As she had never said any word for a long while  I ran and fetched in Mr  Gargery from the forge  She made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her  and wanted me to put her arms round his neck  So I put them round his neck  and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied  And so she presently said  Joe  again  and once  Pardon   and once  Pip   And so she never lifted her head up any more  and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed  because we found she was gone Nothing was ever discovered  Biddy 
Nothing 
Do you know what is become of Orlick

That was not the last time either  Biddy 
no use he is gone Indeed  it would be hard to say too much for him 
we must often speak of these things  for of course I shall be often down here now  I am not going to leave poor Joe alone Biddy  don t you hear me 
Yes  Mr  Pip

O dear me!

and never too often  Pip!
Biddy 
I am not angry  but I am hurt 
No  don t be hurt 
hurt  if I have been ungenerous Well  Pip 
Mr  Pip Take a chair  Mr  Pip 
Now my young friend 
I am going to have a word or two with you 
If you please  sir 
What do you suppose 
do you suppose you are living at the rate of At the rate of  sir 
At 
the--rate--of 
I thought so!
Now  I have asked you a question  my friend 
you anything to ask me questions  sir; but I remember your prohibition Ask one 
Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day 
No  Ask another 
Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon 
Waive that  a moment 
and ask another 
Have-I--anything to receive  sir 
I thought we should come to it!
Now  Mr  Pip 
drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick s cash-book; but you are in debt  of course I am afraid I must say yes  sir 
You know you must say yes; don t you 
Yes  sir 
know  you wouldn t tell me; you would say less  Yes  yes  my friend you would  You ll excuse me  but I know better than you  Now  take this piece of paper in your hand  You have got it  Very good  Now  unfold it and tell me what it is This is a bank-note 
for five hundred pounds 
That is a bank-note 
And a very handsome sum of money too  I think  You consider it so How could I do otherwise!
Ah! But answer the question 
Undoubtedly 
handsome sum of money  Pip  is your own  It is a present to you on this day  in earnest of your expectations  And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum  and at no higher rate  you are to live until the donor of the whole appears  That is to say  you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands  and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter  until you are in communication with the fountain-head  and no longer with the mere agent  As I have told you before  I am the mere agent  I execute my instructions  and I am paid for doing so  I think them injudicious  but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits not paid  Pip to carry your words to any one;
waive for a moment  I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again What is it 
likely you have spoken of  Mr  Jaggers  will soon--Will soon what 
you know Will soon come to London 
or summon me anywhere else 
Now  here 
encountered one another in your village  What did I tell you then  Pip appeared Just so 
that s my answer 
Do you suppose it will still be years hence  Mr  Jaggers 
Come!
question I must not be asked  You ll understand that better  when I tell you it s a question that might compromise me  Come! I ll go a little further with you; I ll say something more When that person discloses 
discloses  my part in this business will cease and determine  When that person discloses  it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it  And that s all I have got to say If that is all you have to say  sir 
left for me to say Mr  Wemmick 
to serve a friend This friend 
but has no money  and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning  Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning With money down 
With some money down 
and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations Mr  Pip 
fingers  if you please  the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea Reach  Let s see; there s London  one; Southwark  two; Blackfriars  three; Waterloo  four; Westminster  five; Vauxhall  six choose from I don t understand you 
Choose your bridge  Mr  Pip 
your bridge  and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your bridge  and you know the end of it  Serve a friend with it  and you may know the end of it too --but it s a less pleasant and profitable end This is very discouraging 
Meant to be so 
Then is it your opinion 
that a man should never--
--Invest portable property in a friend 
he should not  Unless he wants to get rid of the friend --and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him And that 
is your deliberate opinion  Mr  Wemmick 
That 
is my deliberate opinion in this office 
Ah!
but would that be your opinion at Walworth 
Mr  Pip 
office is another  Much as the Aged is one person  and Mr  Jaggers is another  They must not be confounded together  My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office Very well 
Walworth  you may depend upon it Mr  Pip

had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in  and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon s walk  He is very regular in his walks  is my son  Very regular in everything  is my son You made acquaintance with my son  sir 
expect his business  sir is the Law son the Wine-Coopering No  to be sure; you re right 
the Wine-Coopering 
No 
over yonder;However  having an infirmity--for I am hard of hearing  sir--went into the Law  and he took charge of me  and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property  But returning to what you said  you know say is  No to be sure; you re right JOHN
My son s come home!
Miss Skiffins
know  they re both pleasant and useful to the Aged  And by George  sir  it s a thing worth mentioning  that of all the people who come to this gate  the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged  Miss Skiffins  and me!And Mr  Wemmick made them 
out of his own head confiding in you  though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault  in having ever brought me here devilish good of you Say you ll help me to be good then 
Ecod 
that s not my trade 
Nor is this your trading-place 
You are right 
I ll put on my considering-cap  and I think all you want to do may be done by degrees  Skiffins  that s her brother  is an accountant and agent  I ll look him up and go to work for you I thank you ten thousand times 
On the contrary

for he isn t capable of many pleasures--are you  Aged P  
All right  John  all right 
Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper

When one of  em says to another   He was a convict  a few year ago  and is a ignorant common fellow now  for all he s lucky   what do I say  I says to myself   If I ain t a gentleman  nor yet ain t got no learning  I m the owner of such  All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a brought-up London gentleman   This way I kep myself a going  And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day and see my boy  and make myself known to him  on his own ground safe  But I held to it  and the harder it was  the stronger I held  for I was determined  and my mind firm made up  At last I done it  Dear boy  I done it!Where will you put me

Now  Pip 
be careful 
I will  sir 
Don t commit yourself 
You understand--any one  Don t tell me anything: I don t want to know anything; I am not curious I merely want  Mr  Jaggers 
been told is true  I have no hope of its being untrue  but at least I may verify it But did you say  told  or  informed  
communication  You can t have verbal communication with a man in New South Wales  you know I will say  informed  Mr  Jaggers 
Good 
benefactor so long unknown to me That is the man 
in New South Wales 
And only he 
And only he 
my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss Havisham As you say  Pip 
responsible for that And yet it looked so like it  sir 
Not a particle of evidence  Pip 
on evidence  There s no better rule I have no more to say 
I have verified my information  and there s an end 
And Magwitch--in New South Wales--having at last disclosed himself 
my communication with you  I have always adhered to the strict line of fact  There has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact  You are quite aware of that Quite  sir 
me--from New South Wales--the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact  I also communicated to him another caution  He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here  I cautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony  rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law  I gave Magwitch that caution it to New South Wales  He guided himself by it  no doubt No doubt 
I have been informed by Wemmick 
a colonist of the name of Purvis  or--Or Provis 
Provis Yes 
of the name of Provis  asking for the particulars of your address  on behalf of Magwitch  Wemmick sent him the particulars  I understand  by return of post  Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of Magwitch--in New South Wales It came through Provis 
Good day  Pip 
seen you  In writing by post to Magwitch--in New South Wales--or in communicating with him through Provis  have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you  together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining  Good day  Pip!O  what a man he is!

Though  look ee here  Pip s comrade 
back--for half a minute--I ve been low  I said to Pip  I knowed as I had been low  But don t you fret yourself on that score  I ain t made Pip a gentleman  and Pip ain t a going to make you a gentleman  not fur me not to know what s due to ye both  Dear boy  and Pip s comrade  you two may count upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on  Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness  muzzled I am at the present time  muzzled I ever will be Certainly

to be done My poor dear Handel 
to think done  He is intent upon various new expenses --horses  and carriages  and lavish appearances of all kinds  He must be stopped somehow You mean that you can t accept--
How can I 
him!me  strongly attached to me  Was there ever such a fate!My poor dear Handel 
Then 
penny from him  think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily in debt --very heavily for me  who have now no expectations --and I have been bred to no calling  and I am fit for nothing Well  well  well!
Don t say fit for nothing 
is  to go for a soldier  And I might have gone  my dear Herbert  but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection Anyhow  my dear Handel 
you were to renounce this patronage and these favors  I suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had  Not very strong  that hope  if you went soldiering! Besides  it s absurd  You would be infinitely better in Clarriker s house  small as it is  I am working up towards a partnership  you know But there is another question 
determined man  who has long had one fixed idea  More than that  he seems to me  I may misjudge him  to be a man of a desperate and fierce character I know he is 
of it See  then 
of his life  for the realization of his fixed idea  In the moment of realization  after all his toil and waiting  you cut the ground from under his feet  destroy his idea  and make his gains worthless to him  Do you see nothing that he might do  under the disappointment of his arrival  Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken Then you may rely upon it 
danger of his doing it  That is his power over you as long as he remains in England  and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him The first and the main thing to be done 
out of England  You will have to go with him  and then he may be induced to go But get him where I will  could I prevent his coming back 
there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and making him reckless  here  than elsewhere  If a pretext to get him away could be made out of that other convict  or out of anything else in his life  now There  again!
of his life  It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him before me  so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes  and yet so unknown to me  except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood!Handel 
no further benefits from him; do you Fully  Surely you would  too  if you were in my place 
And you feel convinced that you must break with him 
Herbert  can you ask me 
has risked on your account  that you must save him  if possible  from throwing it away  Then you must get him out of England before you stir a finger to extricate yourself  That done  extricate yourself  in Heaven s name  and we ll see it out together  dear old boy Now  Herbert 
his history  There is but one way that I know of  I must ask him point blank Yes  Ask him 
when we sit at breakfast in the morning 
strong  and like a gentleman fashionable crib

like a song  or a story-book  But to give it you short and handy  I ll put it at once into a mouthful of English  In jail and out of jail  in jail and out of jail  in jail and out of jail  There  you ve got it  That s my life pretty much  down to such times as I got shipped off  arter Pip stood my friend   it  Much as I know d the birds  names in the hedges to be chaffinch  sparrer  thrush  I might have thought it was all lies together  only as the birds  names come out true  I supposed mine did   to be pitied as ever I see  not that I looked in the glass  for there warn t many insides of furnished houses known to me   I got the name of being hardened   This is a terrible hardened one   they says to prison wisitors  picking out me   May be said to live in jails  this boy   Then they looked at me  and I looked at them  and they measured my head  some on  em --they had better a measured my stomach --and others on  em giv me tracts what I couldn t read  and made me speeches what I couldn t understand  They always went on agen me about the Devil  But what the Devil was I to do  I must put something into my stomach  mustn t I --Howsomever  I m a getting low  and I know what s due  Dear boy and Pip s comrade  don t you be afeerd of me being low   a man whose skull I d crack wi  this poker  like the claw of a lobster  if I d got it on this hob  His right name was Compeyson; and that s the man  dear boy  what you see me a pounding in the ditch  according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night   watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of clothes   Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal  Not but what it might have been for something else; but it warn t      to be his man and pardner  And what was Compeyson s business in which we was to go pardners  Compeyson s business was the swindling  handwriting forging  stolen bank-note passing  and such-like  All sorts of traps as Compeyson could set with his head  and keep his own legs out of and get the profits from and let another man in for  was Compeyson s business  He d no more heart than a iron file  he was as cold as death  and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned   was partick ler--for where  ud be the good on it  dear boy and comrade  So I begun wi  Compeyson  and a poor tool I was in his hands  Arthur lived at the top of Compeyson s house  over nigh Brentford it was   and Compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging  in case he should ever get better to work it out  But Arthur soon settled the account  The second or third time as ever I see him  he come a tearing down into Compeyson s parlor late at night  in only a flannel gown  with his hair all in a sweat  and he says to Compeyson s wife   Sally  she really is upstairs alonger me  now  and I can t get rid of her  She s all in white   he says   wi  white flowers in her hair  and she s awful mad  and she s got a shroud hanging over her arm  and she says she ll put it on me at five in the morning    the horrors   but she s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed  awful mad  And over where her heart s broke--you broke it!--there s drops of blood    dreadful   Why look at her!  he cries out   She s a shaking the shroud at me! Don t you see her  Look at her eyes! Ain t it awful to see her so mad   Next he cries   She ll put it on me  and then I m done for! Take it away from her  take it away!  And then he catched hold of us  and kep on a talking to her  and answering of her  till I half believed I see her myself   then he starts up with a scream  and screams out   Here she is! She s got the shroud again  She s unfolding it  She s coming out of the corner  She s coming to the bed  Hold me  both on you--one of each side--don t let her touch me with it  Hah! she missed me that time  Don t let her throw it over my shoulders  Don t let her lift me up to get it round me  She s lifting me up  Keep me down!  Then he lifted himself up hard  and was dead   take a week--I ll simply say to you  dear boy  and Pip s comrade  that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave  I was always in debt to him  always under his thumb  always a working  always a getting into danger  He was younger than me  but he d got craft  and he d got learning  and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy  My Missis as I had the hard time wi --Stop though! I ain t brought her in--There ain t no need to go into it 
said  all s said  Did I tell you as I was tried  alone  for misdemeanor  while with Compeyson Well!
that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted; but evidence was wanting  At last  me and Compeyson was both committed for felony --on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation --and there was other charges behind  Compeyson says to me   Separate defences  no communication   and that was all  And I was so miserable poor  that I sold all the clothes I had  except what hung on my back  afore I could get Jaggers    He had worked himself into a state of great excitement  but he checked it  took two or three short breaths  swallowed as often  and stretching out his hand towards me said  in a reassuring manner   He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands  before he could go on    He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again  though I had felt great pity for him   good  He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions; and his punishment was light  I was put in irons  brought to trial again  and sent for life  I didn t stop for life  dear boy and Pip s comrade  being here Is he dead 
Is who dead  dear boy 
Compeyson 
He hopes I am  if he s alive  you may be sure 
never heerd no more of him be Miss Havisham s lover Is this a cut 
Oh!
wondering who it was  who kept the fire off You have just come down 
Yes 
Beastly place 
Your part of the country  I think 
Yes 
I am told it s very like your Shropshire 
Not in the least like it 
Have you been here long 
Long enough to be tired of it 
Do you stay here long 
Can t say 
Do you 
Can t say 
Large tract of marshes about here  I believe 
Yes  What of that 
Oh!
Are you amused  Mr  Drummle 
No 
saddle  I mean to explore those marshes for amusement  Out-of-the-way villages there  they tell me  Curious little public-houses--and smithies--and that  Waiter!Yes  sir 
Is that horse of mine ready 
Brought round to the door  sir 
won t do Very good  sir 
And I don t dine  because I m going to dine at the lady s 
Very good  sir 
Have you been to the Grove since 
No 
there Was that when we had a difference of opinion 
Yes 
Come  come! They let you off easily enough 
shouldn t have lost your temper Mr  Drummle 
subject  When I lose my temper  not that I admit having done so on that occasion   I don t throw glasses I do 
agreeable one I am sure it s not 
don t think anything about it And therefore 
hold no kind of communication in future Quite my opinion 
myself  or done--more likely--without suggesting  But don t lose your temper  Haven t you lost enough without that What do you mean  sir 
Waiter!
to-day  and that I dine at the young lady s Quite so  sir!
And what wind 
blows you here  Pip 
Miss Havisham 
Estella; and finding that some wind had blown her here  I followed presently--in a few moments  It will not surprise you  it will not displease you  I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation  station  fortune  anything  There are reasons why I must say no more of that  It is not my secret  but another s Well belonged to the village over yonder  that I wish I had never left  I suppose I did really come here  as any other chance boy might have come --as a kind of servant  to gratify a want or a whim  and to be paid for it Ay  Pip 
you did 
And that Mr  Jaggers--
Mr  Jaggers 
nothing to do with it  and knew nothing of it  His being my lawyer  and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence  He holds the same relation towards numbers of people  and it might easily arise  Be that as it may  it did arise  and was not brought about by any one you led me on Yes 
I let you go on 
Was that kind 
Who am I 
who am I  for God s sake  that I should be kind 
Well  well  well!
What else 
I was liberally paid for my old attendance here 
my own information  What follows has another  and I hope more disinterested  purpose  In humoring my mistake  Miss Havisham  you punished--practised on--perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention  without offence--your self-seeking relations history  that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so! You made your own snares  I never made them and have been constantly among them since I went to London  I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself  And I should be false and base if I did not tell you  whether it is acceptable to you or no  and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no  that you deeply wrong both Mr  Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert  if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous  upright  open  and incapable of anything designing or mean They are your friends 
They made themselves my friends 
to have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket  Miss Georgiana  and Mistress Camilla were not my friends  I think What do you want for them 
Only 
may be of the same blood  but  believe me  they are not of the same nature What do you want for them 
I am not so cunning  you see 
that I do want something  Miss Havisham  if you would spare the money to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life  but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge  I could show you how Why must it be done without his knowledge 
Because 
without his knowledge  and I don t want to be betrayed  Why I fail in my ability to finish it  I cannot explain  It is a part of the secret which is another person s and not mine What else 
Estella 
long and dearly to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another  While I thought you could not help yourself  as it were  I refrained from saying it  But I must say it now I know 
that I shall ever call you mine  Estella  I am ignorant what may become of me very soon  how poor I may be  or where I may go  Still  I love you  I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house on the susceptibility of a poor boy  and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit  if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did  But I think she did not  I think that  in the endurance of her own trial  she forgot mine  Estella It seems 
fancies --I don t know how to call them --which I am not able to comprehend  When you say you love me  I know what you mean  as a form of words; but nothing more  You address nothing in my breast  you touch nothing there  I don t care for what you say at all  I have tried to warn you of this; now  have I not Yes 
Now  did you not think so beautiful  Estella! Surely it is not in Nature It is in my nature 
difference between you and all other people when I say so much  I can do no more Is it not true 
pursuing you It is quite true 
you this very day Quite true 
You cannot love him  Estella!
mean what I say You would never marry him  Estella 
going to be married to him fatal step  Put me aside for ever --you have done so  I well know --but bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle  Miss Havisham gives you to him  as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you  and to the few who truly love you  Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly  though he has not loved you as long  as I  Take him  and I can bear it better  for your sake!I am going 
him  The preparations for my marriage are making  and I shall be married soon  Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption  It is my own act Your own act  Estella  to fling yourself away upon a brute 
On whom should I fling myself away 
people do feel such things  that I took nothing to him  There! It is done  I shall do well enough  and so will my husband  As to leading me into what you call this fatal step  Miss Havisham would have had me wait  and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led  which has very few charms for me  and I am willing enough to change it  Say no more  We shall never understand each other Such a mean brute  such a stupid brute!
Don t be afraid of my being a blessing to him 
not be that  Come! Here is my hand  Do we part on this  you visionary boy--or man O Estella!
hold my head up with the rest  how could I see you Drummle s wife Nonsense 
nonsense  This will pass in no time 
Never  Estella!
You will get me out of your thoughts in a week 
have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here  the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then  You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since --on the river  on the sails of the ships  on the marshes  in the clouds  in the light  in the darkness  in the wind  in the woods  in the sea  in the streets  You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with  The stones of which the strongest London buildings are made are not more real  or more impossible to be displaced by your hands  than your presence and influence have been to me  there and everywhere  and will be  Estella  to the last hour of my life  you cannot choose but remain part of my character  part of the little good in me  part of the evil  But  in this separation  I associate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always  for you must have done me far more good than harm  let me feel now what sharp distress I may  O God bless you  God forgive you!messenger that brought it  said would you be so good as read it by my lantern PLEASE READ THIS  HERE 
DON T GO HOME 
Halloa  Mr  Pip!
You did come home  then 
Yes 
but I didn t go home 
That s all right 
at each of the Temple gates  on the chance  Which gate did you come to notes evidence if you can help it  because you don t know when it may be put in  I m going to take a liberty with you  Would you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P  Then you can go about your work  Mary Anne 
which leaves us to ourselves  don t you see  Mr  Pip 
Now  Mr  Pip  you know 
another  We are in our private and personal capacities  and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day  Official sentiments are one thing  We are extra official I accidentally heard  yesterday morning 
certain place where I once took you --even between you and me  it s as well not to mention names when avoidable--Much better not 
I understand you 
I heard there by chance  yesterday morning 
a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits  and not unpossessed of portable property --I don t know who it may really be --we won t name this person--Not necessary 
many people go  not always in gratification of their own inclinations  and not quite irrespective of the government expense--thereabouts  From which theories formed  I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court  Temple  had been watched  and might be watched again By whom 
I wouldn t go into that 
official responsibilities  I heard it  as I have in my time heard other curious things in the same place  I don t tell it you on information received  I heard it ain t you  Aged P  John  my boy  all right!suspect  person to whom you have adverted; is it own knowledge  I mean  I couldn t undertake to say it was at first  But it either is  or it will be  or it s in great danger of being Compeyson Is he living 
Is he in London 
Now 
questioning being over 
heard  I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you  I went to Clarriker s to find Mr  Herbert And him you found 
details  I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody--Tom  Jack  or Richard--being about the chambers  or about the immediate neighborhood  he had better get Tom  Jack  or Richard out of the way while you were out of the way He would be greatly puzzled what to do 
that it was not safe to try to get Tom  Jack  or Richard too far out of the way at present  Mr  Pip  I ll tell you something  Under existing circumstances  there is no place like a great city when you are once in it  Don t break cover too soon  Lie close  Wait till things slacken  before you try the open  even for foreign air Mr  Herbert 
hour  struck out a plan  He mentioned to me as a secret  that he is courting a young lady who has  as no doubt you are aware  a bedridden Pa  Which Pa  having been in the Purser line of life  lies a-bed in a bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river  You are acquainted with the young lady  most probably Not personally 
The house with the bow-window 
down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich  and being kept  it seems  by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let  Mr  Herbert put it to me  what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom  Jack  or Richard  Now  I thought very well of it  for three reasons I ll give you  That is to say: Firstly  It s altogether out of all your beats  and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small  Secondly  Without going near it yourself  you could always hear of the safety of Tom  Jack  or Richard  through Mr  Herbert  Thirdly  After a while and when it might be prudent  if you should want to slip Tom  Jack  or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat  there he is--ready by nine o clock last night he housed Tom  Jack  or Richard --whichever it may be --you and I don t want to know --quite successfully  At the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover  and  in fact  he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it  Now  another great advantage of all this is  that it was done without you  and when  if any one was concerning himself about your movements  you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged  This diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I recommended that  even if you came back last night  you should not go home  It brings in more confusion  and you want confusion And now  Mr  Pip 
have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more --from a Walworth point of view  and in a strictly private and personal capacity --I shall be glad to do it  Here s the address  There can be no harm in your going here to-night  and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tom  Jack  or Richard  before you go home --which is another reason for your not going home last night  But  after you have gone home  don t go back here  You are very welcome  I am sure  Mr  Pipfinally impress one important point upon you evening to lay hold of his portable property  You don t know what may happen to him  Don t let anything happen to the portable property Time s up 
pressing to do than to keep here till dark  that s what I should advise  You look very much worried  and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the Aged --he ll be up presently --and a little bit of--you remember the pig Of course 
he was in all respects a first-rater  Do try him  if it is only for old acquaintance sake  Good-bye  Aged Parent!All right  John; all right  my boy!
All is well  Handel 
eager to see you  My dear girl is with her father; and if you ll wait till she comes down  I ll make you known to her  and then we ll go upstairs  That s her father I am afraid he is a sad old rascal 
never seen him  Don t you smell rum  He is always at it At rum 
Yes 
gout  He persists  too  in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his room  and serving them out  He keeps them on shelves over his head  and will weigh them all  His room must be like a chandler s shop What else can be the consequence 
he will cut the cheese  A man with the gout in his right hand--and everywhere else--can t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting himself To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs  Whimple 
curious place  Handel; isn t it Mrs  Whimple 
housewives  and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help  For  Clara has no mother of her own  Handel  and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim Surely that s not his name  Herbert 
No  no 
But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations  and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family!Clara 
Look here 
supper  served out every night  Here s her allowance of bread  and here s her slice of cheese  and here s her rum --which I drink  This is Mr  Barley s breakfast for to-morrow  served out to be cooked  Two mutton-chops  three potatoes  some split peas  a little flour  two ounces of butter  a pinch of salt  and all this black pepper  It s stewed up together  and taken hot  and it s a nice thing for the gout  I should think!me  darling!There is an unconscionable old shark for you!
you suppose he wants now  Handel I don t know 
Something to drink 
That s it!
Wait a moment  and you ll hear Clara lift him up to take some  There he goes!Now 
he s drinking  Now 
on his back!bless your eyes  Here s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back  by the Lord  Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder  here s your old Bill Barley  bless your eyes  Ahoy! Bless you Ay  ay  dear boy!
Jaggers knows 
Then  I have talked with Wemmick 
what caution he gave me and what advice watermen  Handel  and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes  No boat would then be hired for the purpose  and no boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion  and any chance is worth saving  Never mind the season; don t you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs  and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river  You fall into that habit  and then who notices or minds  Do it twenty or fifty times  and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or fifty-first you here here than near me  Good-bye!Dear boy 
meet again  and I don t like good-bye  Say good night!comes you may be certain I shall be ready  Good night  good night!Fill  fill!
How do you do 
I saw that you saw me 
Saw you  Mr  Pip!
was there Who else 
It is the strangest thing 
and yet I could swear to him 
Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there 
yet I think I should Oh! He can t be in sight 
off  I saw him go that you were quite unconscious of him  sitting behind you there like a ghost so very strange! You ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you  I could hardly believe it myself  if you told me Indeed 
when you were quite a child  and I dined at Gargery s  and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended I remember it very well 
joined in it  and that Gargery took you on his back  and that I took the lead  and you kept up with me as well as you could I remember it all very well 
there was a scuffle between them  and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other I see it all before me 
and that we went on to see the last of them  over the black marshes  with the torchlight shining on their faces --I am particular about that --with the torchlight shining on their faces  when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us Yes 
I remember all that 
him over your shoulder Steady!
you saw The one who had been mauled 
saw him! The more I think of him  the more certain I am of him This is very curious!
Very curious indeed!
like a ghost 
are you bound for For the Temple  I think 
Don t you know 
Well 
I do not know  for I have not made up my mind 
You are going to dine 
that  I suppose No 
I don t mind admitting that 
And are not engaged 
I don t mind admitting also that I am not engaged 
Then 
come and dine with me 
Wemmick s coming 
Did you send that note of Miss Havisham s to Mr  Pip  Wemmick 
No  sir 
Pip into the office  Here it is It s a note of two lines  Pip 
up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your address  She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her  You ll go down Yes 
When do you think of going down 
I have an impending engagement 
my time  At once  I think If Mr  Pip has the intention of going at once 
he needn t write an answer  you know 
So  Pip! Our friend the Spider 
cards  He has won the pool his own way  The stronger will win in the end  but the stronger has to be found out first  If he should turn to  and beat her--Surely 
seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that  Mr  Jaggers beat her  he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be a question of intellect  he certainly will not  It would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances  because it s a toss-up between two results May I ask what they are 
A fellow like our friend the Spider 
beats or cringes  He may cringe and growl  or cringe and not growl; but he either beats or cringes  Ask Wemmick his opinion Either beats or cringes 
So here s to Mrs  Bentley Drummle

living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine with him --and I dine more comfortably unscrewed Wouldn t say it to anybody but yourself 
what is said between you and me goes no further Wemmick 
Mr  Jaggers s private house  to notice that housekeeper Did I 
Ah  I dare say I did  Deuce take me 
I know I did  I find I am not quite unscrewed yet 
A wild beast tamed  you called her 
And what do you call her 
The same  How did Mr  Jaggers tame her  Wemmick 
That s his secret  She has been with him many a long year

all of it  But what I do know I ll tell you  We are in our private and personal capacities  of course Of course 
murder  and was acquitted  She was a very handsome young woman  and I believe had some gypsy blood in her  Anyhow  it was hot enough when it was up  as you may suppose But she was acquitted 
Mr  Jaggers was for her 
case  and it was comparatively early days with him then  and he worked it to general admiration; in fact  it may almost be said to have made him  He worked it himself at the police-office  day after day for many days  contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he couldn t work it himself  sat under counsel  and--every one knew--put in all the salt and pepper  The murdered person was a woman --a woman a good ten years older  very much larger  and very much stronger  It was a case of jealousy  They both led tramping lives  and this woman in Gerrard Street here had been married very young  over the broomstick  as we say   to a tramping man  and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy  The murdered woman --more a match for the man  certainly  in point of years--was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath  There had been a violent struggle  perhaps a fight  She was bruised and scratched and torn  and had been held by the throat  at last  and choked  Now  there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman  and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr  Jaggers principally rested his case  You may be sure though he sometimes does now Well  sir!
see --that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension  that she looked much slighter than she really was; in particular  her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look  She had only a bruise or two about her --nothing for a tramp --but the backs of her hands were lacerated  and the question was  Was it with finger-nails  Now  Mr  Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence  as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through  and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there  But the boldest point he made was this: it was attempted to be set up  in proof of her jealousy  that she was under strong suspicion of having  at about the time of the murder  frantically destroyed her child by this man--some three years old--to revenge herself upon him  Mr  Jaggers worked that in this way:  
 said Wemmick  
   said Wemmick  
     We exchanged a cordial good-night  and I went home  with new matter for my thoughts  though with no relief from the old      Chapter XLIX  Putting Miss Havisham s note in my pocket  that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House  in case her waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me  I went down again by the coach next day  But I alighted at the Halfway House  and breakfasted there  and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways  and to leave it in the same manner   The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the High Street  The nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had their refectories and gardens  and where the strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables  were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves  The cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me  as I hurried on avoiding observation  than they had ever had before; so  the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks  as they hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden  seemed to call to me that the place was changed  and that Estella was gone out of it for ever   An elderly woman  whom I had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard  opened the gate  The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within  as of old  and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone  Miss Havisham was not in her own room  but was in the larger room across the landing  Looking in at the door  after knocking in vain  I saw her sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair  close before  and lost in the contemplation of  the ashy fire   Doing as I had often done  I went in  and stood touching the old chimney-piece  where she could see me when she raised her eyes  There was an air of utter loneliness upon her  that would have moved me to pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge her with  As I stood compassionating her  and thinking how  in the progress of time  I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house  her eyes rested on me  She stared  and said in a low voice     As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down  I remarked a new expression on her face  as if she were afraid of me    she said  
 When I said some reassuring words  she stretched out her tremulous right hand  as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it again before I understood the action  or knew how to receive it      I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership  I had not got far into it  when I judged from her looks that she was thinking in a discursive way of me  rather than of what I said  It seemed to be so; for  when I stopped speaking  many moments passed before she showed that she was conscious of the fact   of me    I answered  
  she answered  putting a hand to her head  
 She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her  and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend  I went on with my explanation  and told her how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means  but how in this I was disappointed  That part of the subject  I reminded her  involved matters which could form no part of my explanation  for they were the weighty secrets of another    said she  assenting with her head  but not looking at me  
 I was rather afraid of stating it  for it sounded a large sum        She asked this question  still without looking at me  but in an unwonted tone of sympathy  I could not reply at the moment  for my voice failed me  She put her left arm across the head of her stick  and softly laid her forehead on it    After a little while  she raised her head  and looked at the fire again       She presently rose from her seat  and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing  There were none there  and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets  mounted in tarnished gold  and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck       She read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear  and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money  I took the tablets from her hand  and it trembled again  and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached  and put it in mine  All this she did without looking at me   forgive her   said I  
 She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it  and  to my amazement  I may even add to my terror  dropped on her knees at my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which  when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole  they must often have been raised to heaven from her mother s side   To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame  I entreated her to rise  and got my arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp  and hung her head over it and wept  I had never seen her shed a tear before  and  in the hope that the relief might do her good  I bent over her without speaking  She was not kneeling now  but was down upon the ground    she cried  despairingly  
   It was a needless question  for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so   her white hair  and returned to this cry over and over again   I knew not how to answer  or how to comfort her  That she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment  spurned affection  and wounded pride found vengeance in  I knew full well  But that  in shutting out the light of day  she had shut out infinitely more; that  in seclusion  she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that  her mind  brooding solitary  had grown diseased  as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker  I knew equally well  And could I look upon her without compassion  seeing her punishment in the ruin she was  in her profound unfitness for this earth on which she was placed  in the vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania  like the vanity of penitence  the vanity of remorse  the vanity of unworthiness  and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world   twenty  fifty times over  What had she done!   I said  when her cry had died away  
 compassion for me in her new affection    said I  
   I could not help saying  
 With that  Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while  and then burst out again  What had she done!   she pleaded  
  I answered  as delicately as I could  
 She was seated on the ground  with her arms on the ragged chair  and her head leaning on them  She looked full at me when I said this  and replied    She shook her head    She shook her head again      She answered in a low whisper and with caution:    So convinced I was of that woman s being her mother  that I wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind  But  to any mind  I thought  the connection here was clear and straight   What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview  I had succeeded on behalf of Herbert  Miss Havisham had told me all she knew of Estella  I had said and done what I could to ease her mind  No matter with what other words we parted; we parted   Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air  I called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered  that I would not trouble her just yet  but would walk round the place before leaving  For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again  and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it   By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago  and on which the rain of years had fallen since  rotting them in many places  and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end  I made my way to the ruined garden  I went all round it; round by the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the paths where Estella and I had walked  So cold  so lonely  so dreary all!  Taking the brewery on my way back  I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it  and walked through  I was going out at the opposite door --not easy to open now  for the damp wood had started and swelled  and the hinges were yielding  and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus --when I turned my head to look back  A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action  and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam  So strong was the impression  that I stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy --though to be sure I was there in an instant   The mournfulness of the place and time  and the great terror of this illusion  though it was but momentary  caused me to feel an indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart  Passing on into the front courtyard  I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she had the key  or first to go upstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left her  I took the latter course and went up   I looked into the room where I had left her  and I saw her seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire  with her back towards me  In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away  I saw a great flaming light spring up  In the same moment I saw her running at me  shrieking  with a whirl of fire blazing all about her  and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high   I had a double-caped great-coat on  and over my arm another thick coat  That I got them off  closed with her  threw her down  and got them over her; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose  and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst  and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies  and that the closer I covered her  the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself --that this occurred I knew through the result  but not through anything I felt  or thought  or knew I did  I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the floor by the great table  and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air  which  a moment ago  had been her faded bridal dress   Then  I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor  and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door  I still held her forcibly down with all my strength  like a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was  or why we had struggled  or that she had been in flames  or that the flames were out  until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us   She was insensible  and I was afraid to have her moved  or even touched  Assistance was sent for  and I held her until it came  as if I unreasonably fancied  I think I did  that  if I let her go  the fire would break out again and consume her  When I got up  on the surgeon s coming to her with other aid  I was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt; for  I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling   On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts  but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock  By the surgeon s directions  her bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table  which happened to be well suited to the dressing of her injuries  When I saw her again  an hour afterwards  she lay  indeed  where I had seen her strike her stick  and had heard her say that she would lie one day   Though every vestige of her dress was burnt  as they told me  she still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for  they had covered her to the throat with white cotton-wool  and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that  the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her   I found  on questioning the servants  that Estella was in Paris  and I got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next post  Miss Havisham s family I took upon myself; intending to communicate with Mr  Matthew Pocket only  and leave him to do as he liked about informing the rest  This I did next day  through Herbert  as soon as I returned to town   There was a stage  that evening  when she spoke collectedly of what had happened  though with a certain terrible vivacity  Towards midnight she began to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice  And then   And then  
sometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in another word  but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word   As I could do no service there  and as I had  nearer home  that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive out of my mind  I decided  in the course of the night that I would return by the early morning coach  walking on a mile or so  and being taken up clear of the town  At about six o clock of the morning  therefore  I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine  just as they said  not stopping for being touched      Chapter L  My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night  and again in the morning  My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow  and  less severely  as high as the shoulder; it was very painful  but the flames had set in that direction  and I felt thankful it was no worse  My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers  It was bandaged  of course  but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a cloak  loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck  My hair had been caught by the fire  but not my head or face   When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father  he came back to me at our chambers  and devoted the day to attending on me  He was the kindest of nurses  and at stated times took off the bandages  and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready  and put them on again  with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for   At first  as I lay quiet on the sofa  I found it painfully difficult  I might say impossible  to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames  their hurry and noise  and the fierce burning smell  If I dozed for a minute  I was awakened by Miss Havisham s cries  and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head  This pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I suffered; and Herbert  seeing that  did his utmost to hold my attention engaged   Neither of us spoke of the boat  but we both thought of it  That was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject  and by our agreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many hours  not of so many weeks   My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course  whether all was well down the river  As he replied in the affirmative  with perfect confidence and cheerfulness  we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away  But then  as Herbert changed the bandages  more by the light of the fire than by the outer light  he went back to it spontaneously      said Herbert  
     I had started  but not under his touch  His words had given me a start      Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly  as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for    said I  
  said Herbert  
    said Herbert          and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me     pursued Herbert  
    said I  
     said I  after a short silence  in a hurried way  
        said Herbert  after taking time to examine me  
     Chapter LI  What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving Estella s parentage  I cannot say  It will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own   But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation  I was seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down --that I ought not to let it rest  but that I ought to see Mr  Jaggers  and come at the bare truth  I really do not know whether I felt that I did this for Estella s sake  or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me  Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth   Any way  I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street that night  Herbert s representations that  if I did  I should probably be laid up and stricken useless  when our fugitive s safety would depend upon me  alone restrained my impatience  On the understanding  again and again reiterated  that  come what would  I was to go to Mr  Jaggers to-morrow  I at length submitted to keep quiet  and to have my hurts looked after  and to stay at home  Early next morning we went out together  and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield  I left Herbert to go his way into the City  and took my way to Little Britain   There were periodical occasions when Mr  Jaggers and Wemmick went over the office accounts  and checked off the vouchers  and put all things straight  On these occasions  Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr  Jaggers s room  and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office  Finding such clerk on Wemmick s post that morning  I knew what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr  Jaggers and Wemmick together  as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him   My appearance  with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders  favored my object  Although I had sent Mr  Jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town  yet I had to give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard  and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence  than it had been before  While I described the disaster  Mr  Jaggers stood  according to his wont  before the fire  Wemmick leaned back in his chair  staring at me  with his hands in the pockets of his trousers  and his pen put horizontally into the post  The two brutal casts  always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings  seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn t smell fire at the present moment   My narrative finished  and their questions exhausted  I then produced Miss Havisham s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert  Mr  Jaggers s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when I handed him the tablets  but he presently handed them over to Wemmick  with instructions to draw the check for his signature  While that was in course of being done  I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote  and Mr  Jaggers  poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots  looked on at me  when he had signed it    I returned  
 Wemmick s lips form the words    As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart  I said  turning on Mr  Jaggers:--   then straightening himself    Mr  Jaggers looked at me inquiringly  and repeated       said I  
 A certain stop that Mr  Jaggers came to in his manner--he was too self-possessed to change his manner  but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop--assured me that he did not know who her father was  This I had strongly suspected from Provis s account  as Herbert had repeated it  of his having kept himself dark; which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr  Jaggers s client until some four years later  and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity  But  I could not be sure of this unconsciousness on Mr  Jaggers s part before  though I was quite sure of it now     I replied  
 Even Mr  Jaggers started when I said those words  It was the slightest start that could escape a man  the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked  but he did start  though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief  How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just then  lest Mr  Jaggers s sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us   paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose    said I  
 For once  the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed  My reply was so unexpected  that Mr  Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance  folded his arms  and looked with stern attention at me  though with an immovable face   Then I told him all I knew  and how I knew it; with the one reservation that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact knew from Wemmick  I was very careful indeed as to that  Nor did I look towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell  and had been for some time silently meeting Mr  Jaggers s look  When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmick s direction  I found that he had unposted his pen  and was intent upon the table before him   table   But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way  and I made a passionate  almost an indignant appeal  to him to be more frank and manly with me  I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had lapsed  the length of time they had lasted  and the discovery I had made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits  I represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him  in return for the confidence I had just now imparted  I said that I did not blame him  or suspect him  or mistrust him  but I wanted assurance of the truth from him  And if he asked me why I wanted it  and why I thought I had any right to it  I would tell him  little as he cared for such poor dreams  that I had loved Estella dearly and long  and that although I had lost her  and must live a bereaved life  whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world  And seeing that Mr  Jaggers stood quite still and silent  and apparently quite obdurate  under this appeal  I turned to Wemmick  and said   I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr  Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe  At first  a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment; but it melted as I saw Mr  Jaggers relax into something like a smile  and Wemmick become bolder    said Mr  Jaggers  
  returned Wemmick  
 openly    returned Wemmick  growing bolder and bolder  
 Again they exchanged their former odd looks  each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in     returned Wemmick  
 Mr  Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times  and actually drew a sigh   said he  
 He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing    said Mr  Jaggers  
    did such and such things to divert suspicion  I have tracked you through it all  and I tell it you all  Part with the child  unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you  and then it shall be produced  Give the child into my hands  and I will do my best to bring you off  If you are saved  your child is saved too; if you are lost  your child is still saved     And Wemmick repeated  
      And Wemmick said    I looked at Wemmick  whose face was very grave  He gravely touched his lips with his forefinger  I did the same  Mr  Jaggers did the same   said the latter then  resuming his usual manner  
 Standing by for a little  while they were at work  I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with this difference now  that each of them seemed suspicious  not to say conscious  of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other  For this reason  I suppose  they were now inflexible with one another; Mr  Jaggers being highly dictatorial  and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment  I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together   But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike  the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve  whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls  This individual  who  either in his own person or in that of some member of his family  seemed to be always in trouble  which in that place meant Newgate   called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting  As he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick  Mr  Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings  Mike s eye happened to twinkle with a tear      said Wemmick  
   demanded Wemmick  quite savagely  
 to the door    said Wemmick  
 So  the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew  and Mr  Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding  and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch      Chapter LII   From Little Britain I went  with my check in my pocket  to Miss Skiffins s brother  the accountant; and Miss Skiffins s brother  the accountant  going straight to Clarriker s and bringing Clarriker to me  I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement  It was the only good thing I had done  and the only completed thing I had done  since I was first apprised of my great expectations   Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House were steadily progressing  that he would now be able to establish a small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension of the business  and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it  I found that I must have prepared for a separation from my friend  even though my own affairs had been more settled  And now  indeed  I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold  and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves   But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes  little imagining that he told me no news  and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights  and of me going out to join them  with a caravan of camels  I believe   and of our all going up the Nile and seeing wonders  Without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans  I felt that Herbert s way was clearing fast  and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum  and his daughter would soon be happily provided for   We had now got into the month of March  My left arm  though it presented no bad symptoms  took  in the natural course  so long to heal that I was still unable to get a coat on  My right arm was tolerably restored; disfigured  but fairly serviceable   On a Monday morning  when Herbert and I were at breakfast  I received the following letter from Wemmick by the post    When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire--but not before we had both got it by heart--we considered what to do  For  of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view    said Herbert  
 I had thought of him more than once       It had seemed to me  in the many anxious considerations I had given the point  almost indifferent what port we made for --Hamburg  Rotterdam  Antwerp --the place signified little  so that he was out of England  Any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do  I had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend  which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot  As foreign steamers would leave London at about the time of high-water  our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb-tide  and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one  The time when one would be due where we lay  wherever that might be  could be calculated pretty nearly  if we made inquiries beforehand   Herbert assented to all this  and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations  We found that a steamer for Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best  and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel  But we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave London with the same tide  and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and color of each  We then separated for a few hours: I  to get at once such passports as were necessary; Herbert  to see Startop at his lodgings  We both did what we had to do without any hindrance  and when we met again at one o clock reported it done  I  for my part  was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen Startop  and he was more than ready to join   Those two should pull a pair of oars  we settled  and I would steer; our charge would be sitter  and keep quiet; as speed was not our object  we should make way enough  We arranged that Herbert should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he should not go there at all to-morrow evening  Tuesday; that he should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house  on Wednesday  when he saw us approach  and not sooner; that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that he should be communicated with no more in any way  until we took him on board   These precautions well understood by both of us  I went home   On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key  I found a letter in the box  directed to me; a very dirty letter  though not ill-written  It had been delivered by hand  of course  since I left home   and its contents were these:--   I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter  What to do now  I could not tell  And the worst was  that I must decide quickly  or I should miss the afternoon coach  which would take me down in time for to-night  To-morrow night I could not think of going  for it would be too close upon the time of the flight  And again  for anything I knew  the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself   If I had had ample time for consideration  I believe I should still have gone  Having hardly any time for consideration --my watch showing me that the coach started within half an hour --I resolved to go  I should certainly not have gone  but for the reference to my Uncle Provis  That  coming on Wemmick s letter and the morning s busy preparation  turned the scale   It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter  in a violent hurry  that I had to read this mysterious epistle again twice  before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind  Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way  I left a note in pencil for Herbert  telling him that as I should be so soon going away  I knew not for how long  I had decided to hurry down and back  to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring  I had then barely time to get my great-coat  lock up the chambers  and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways  If I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets  I should have missed my aim; going as I did  I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard  I was the only inside passenger  jolting away knee-deep in straw  when I came to myself   For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had so bewildered me  ensuing on the hurry of the morning  The morning hurry and flutter had been great; for  long and anxiously as I had waited for Wemmick  his hint had come like a surprise at last  And now I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach  and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there  and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back  and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication  and  in short  to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers  Still  the reference to Provis by name mastered everything  I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it --if that be reasoning --in case any harm should befall him through my not going  how could I ever forgive myself!  It was dark before we got down  and the journey seemed long and dreary to me  who could see little of it inside  and who could not go outside in my disabled state  Avoiding the Blue Boar  I put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town  and ordered some dinner  While it was preparing  I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she was still very ill  though considered something better   My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house  and I dined in a little octagonal common-room  like a font  As I was not able to cut my dinner  the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me  This bringing us into conversation  he was so good as to entertain me with my own story --of course with the popular feature that Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes     repeated the landlord  
   said the landlord  
   said the landlord  
   returned the landlord  
   replied the landlord  
   I thought   glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat   fire   I had never been struck at so keenly  for my thanklessness to Joe  as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook  The falser he  the truer Joe; the meaner he  the nobler Joe   My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire for an hour or more  The striking of the clock aroused me  but not from my dejection or remorse  and I got up and had my coat fastened round my neck  and went out  I had previously sought in my pockets for the letter  that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it  and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach  I knew very well  however  that the appointed place was the little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes  and the hour nine  Towards the marshes I now went straight  having no time to spare      Chapter LIII  It was a dark night  though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed lands  and passed out upon the marshes  Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky  hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon  In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field  in among the piled mountains of cloud   There was a melancholy wind  and the marshes were very dismal  A stranger would have found them insupportable  and even to me they were so oppressive that I hesitated  half inclined to go back  But I knew them well  and could have found my way on a far darker night  and had no excuse for returning  being there  So  having come there against my inclination  I went on against it   The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay  nor that in which we had pursued the convicts  My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on  and  though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand  I saw them over my shoulder  I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery  but they were miles apart; so that  if a light had been burning at each point that night  there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks   At first  I had to shut some gates after me  and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds  But after a little while I seemed to have the whole flats to myself   It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln  The lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell  but the fires were made up and left  and no workmen were visible  Hard by was a small stone-quarry  It lay directly in my way  and had been worked that day  as I saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about   Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation --for the rude path lay through it --I saw a light in the old sluice-house  I quickened my pace  and knocked at the door with my hand  Waiting for some reply  I looked about me  noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken  and how the house--of wood with a tiled roof--would not be proof against the weather much longer  if it were so even now  and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime  and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me  Still there was no answer  and I knocked again  No answer still  and I tried the latch   It rose under my hand  and the door yielded  Looking in  I saw a lighted candle on a table  a bench  and a mattress on a truckle bedstead  As there was a loft above  I called  answered  Then I looked at my watch  and  finding that it was past nine  called again  went out at the door  irresolute what to do   It was beginning to rain fast  Seeing nothing save what I had seen already  I turned back into the house  and stood just within the shelter of the doorway  looking out into the night  While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back  or the candle would not be burning  it came into my head to look if the wick were long  I turned round to do so  and had taken up the candle in my hand  when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next thing I comprehended was  that I had been caught in a strong running noose  thrown over my head from behind    said a suppressed voice with an oath  
  I cried  struggling  
 Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides  but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain  Sometimes  a strong man s hand  sometimes a strong man s breast  was set against my mouth to deaden my cries  and with a hot breath always close to me  I struggled ineffectually in the dark  while I was fastened tight to the wall   said the suppressed voice with another oath  
 Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm  bewildered by the surprise  and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution  I desisted  and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little  But  it was bound too tight for that  I felt as if  having been burnt before  it were now being boiled   The sudden exclusion of the night  and the substitution of black darkness in its place  warned me that the man had closed a shutter  After groping about for a little  he found the flint and steel he wanted  and began to strike a light  I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder  and upon which he breathed and breathed  match in hand  but I could only see his lips  and the blue point of the match; even those but fitfully  The tinder was damp --no wonder there --and one after another the sparks died out   The man was in no hurry  and struck again with the flint and steel  As the sparks fell thick and bright about him  I could see his hands  and touches of his face  and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table; but nothing more  Presently I saw his blue lips again  breathing on the tinder  and then a flare of light flashed up  and showed me Orlick   Whom I had looked for  I don t know  I had not looked for him  Seeing him  I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed  and I kept my eyes upon him   He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation  and dropped the match  and trod it out  Then he put the candle away from him on the table  so that he could see me  and sat with his arms folded on the table and looked at me  I made out that I was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall --a fixture there --the means of ascent to the loft above    said he  when we had surveyed one another for some time  
   he returned  
     His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished  as he sat with his arms folded on the table  shaking his head at me and hugging himself  had a malignity in it that made me tremble  As I watched him in silence  he put his hand into the corner at his side  and took up a gun with a brass-bound stock    said he  making as if he would take aim at me  
        in the last interview I had with her  his mouth snarling like a tiger s  I felt that it was true    heavy blow  and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force -- He leaned forward staring at me  slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me  and sat down again    I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave  For a moment I looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none    said he  folding his arms on the table again  
 My mind  with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such a death  Estella s father would believe I had deserted him  would be taken  would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me  when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had called at Miss Havisham s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would never know how sorry I had been that night  none would ever know what I had suffered  how true I had meant to be  what an agony I had passed through  The death close before me was terrible  but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death  And so quick were my thoughts  that I saw myself despised by unborn generations --Estella s children  and their children --while the wretch s words were yet on his lips    said he  
 It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few could know better than I  the solitary nature of the spot  and the hopelessness of aid  But as he sat gloating over me  I was supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips  Above all things  I resolved that I would not entreat him  and that I would die making some last poor resistance to him  Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon  as I did  of Heaven; melted at heart  as I was  by the thought that I had taken no farewell  and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me  or could explain myself to them  or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors --still  if I could have killed him  even in dying  I would have done it   He had been drinking  and his eyes were red and bloodshot  Around his neck was slung a tin bottle  as I had often seen his meat and drink slung about him in other days  He brought the bottle to his lips  and took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw flash into his face    said he  folding his arms again  
 Again my mind  with its former inconceivable rapidity  had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister  her illness  and her death  before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words    retorted  catching up the gun  and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us   He drank again  and became more ferocious  I saw by his tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it  I distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me  I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life  I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before  like my own warning ghost  he would do as he had done in my sister s case --make all haste to the town  and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses  My rapid mind pursued him to the town  made a picture of the street with him in it  and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapor creeping over it  into which I should have dissolved   It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years while he said a dozen words  but that what he did say presented pictures to me  and not mere words  In the excited and exalted state of my brain  I could not think of a place without seeing it  or of persons without seeing them  It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these images  and yet I was so intent  all the time  upon him himself --who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!--that I knew of the slightest action of his fingers   When he had drunk this second time  he rose from the bench on which he sat  and pushed the table aside  Then  he took up the candle  and  shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me  stood before me  looking at me and enjoying the sight    I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps  I saw the shadows of the heavy stair-rails  thrown by the watchman s lantern on the wall  I saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here  a door half open; there  a door closed; all the articles of furniture around    Mill Pond Bank  and Chinks s Basin  and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk  all so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms  the signal whose use was over  pretty Clara  the good motherly woman  old Bill Barley on his back  all drifting by  as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea!   In his savage taunting  he flared the candle so close at me that I turned my face aside to save it from the flame    he cried  laughing  after doing it again  
 He flared the candle at me again  smoking my face and hair  and for an instant blinding me  and turned his powerful back as he replaced the light on the table  I had thought a prayer  and had been with Joe and Biddy and Herbert  before he turned towards me again   There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall  Within this space  he now slouched backwards and forwards  His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before  as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides  and with his eyes scowling at me  I had no grain of hope left  Wild as my inward hurry was  and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts  I could yet clearly understand that  unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge  he would never have told me what he had told   Of a sudden  he stopped  took the cork out of his bottle  and tossed it away  Light as it was  I heard it fall like a plummet  He swallowed slowly  tilting up the bottle by little and little  and now he looked at me no more  The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his hand  and licked up  Then  with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly  he threw the bottle from him  and stooped; and I saw in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle   The resolution I had made did not desert me  for  without uttering one vain word of appeal to him  I shouted out with all my might  and struggled with all my might  It was only my head and my legs that I could move  but to that extent I struggled with all the force  until then unknown  that was within me  In the same instant I heard responsive shouts  saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door  heard voices and tumult  and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men  as if it were tumbling water  clear the table at a leap  and fly out into the night   After a blank  I found that I was lying unbound  on the floor  in the same place  with my head on some one s knee  My eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall  when I came to myself --had opened on it before my mind saw it --and thus as I recovered consciousness  I knew that I was in the place where I had lost it   Too indifferent at first  even to look round and ascertain who supported me  I was lying looking at the ladder  when there came between me and it a face  The face of Trabb s boy!   said Trabb s boy  in a sober voice; 
 At these words  the face of him who supported me looked over into mine  and I saw my supporter to be--    said Herbert  
   said Herbert  
 The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in my arm  strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time--a day and a night --two days and nights --more      said Herbert  
  said I  
 They laid it bare  and did what they could  It was violently swollen and inflamed  and I could scarcely endure to have it touched  But  they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages  and carefully replaced it in the sling  until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it  In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house  and were passing through the quarry on our way back  Trabb s boy--Trabb s overgrown young man now--went before us with a lantern  which was the light I had seen come in at the door  But  the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky  and the night  though rainy  was much lighter  The white vapor of the kiln was passing from us as we went by  and as I had thought a prayer before  I thought a thanksgiving now   Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue --which at first he had flatly refused to do  but had insisted on my remaining quiet --I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter  open  in our chambers  where he  coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me  found it  very soon after I was gone  Its tone made him uneasy  and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him  His uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding  after a quarter of an hour s consideration  he set off for the coach-office with Startop  who volunteered his company  to make inquiry when the next coach went down  Finding that the afternoon coach was gone  and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm  as obstacles came in his way  he resolved to follow in a post-chaise  So he and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar  fully expecting there to find me  or tidings of me; but  finding neither  went on to Miss Havisham s  where they lost me  Hereupon they went back to the hotel  doubtless at about the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my own story  to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes  Among the loungers under the Boar s archway happened to be Trabb s Boy --true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business --and Trabb s boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham s in the direction of my dining-place  Thus Trabb s boy became their guide  and with him they went out to the sluice-house  though by the town way to the marshes  which I had avoided  Now  as they went along  Herbert reflected  that I might  after all  have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis s safety  and  bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous  left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry  and went on by himself  and stole round the house two or three times  endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within  As he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice  this was while my mind was so busy   he even at last began to doubt whether I was there  when suddenly I cried out loudly  and he answered the cries  and rushed in  closely followed by the other two   When I told Herbert what had passed within the house  he was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town  late at night as it was  and getting out a warrant  But  I had already considered that such a course  by detaining us there  or binding us to come back  might be fatal to Provis  There was no gainsaying this difficulty  and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time  For the present  under the circumstances  we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to Trabb s boy; who  I am convinced  would have been much affected by disappointment  if he had known that his intervention saved me from the limekiln  Not that Trabb s boy was of a malignant nature  but that he had too much spare vivacity  and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody s expense  When we parted  I presented him with two guineas  which seemed to meet his views   and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him  which made no impression on him at all    Wednesday being so close upon us  we determined to go back to London that night  three in the post-chaise; the rather  as we should then be clear away before the night s adventure began to be talked of  Herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through  I was just able to bear its pain on the journey  It was daylight when we reached the Temple  and I went at once to bed  and lay in bed all day   My terror  as I lay there  of falling ill  and being unfitted for to-morrow  was so besetting  that I wonder it did not disable me of itself  It would have done so  pretty surely  in conjunction with the mental wear and tear I had suffered  but for the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was  So anxiously looked forward to  charged with such consequences  its results so impenetrably hidden  though so near   No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day; yet this again increased my restlessness  I started at every footstep and every sound  believing that he was discovered and taken  and this was the messenger to tell me so  I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact had occurred  and I had a mysterious knowledge of it  As the days wore on  and no ill news came  as the day closed in and darkness fell  my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow morning altogether mastered me  My burning arm throbbed  and my burning head throbbed  and I fancied I was beginning to wander  I counted up to high numbers  to make sure of myself  and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse  It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind  I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to myself with a start   They kept me very quiet all day  and kept my arm constantly dressed  and gave me cooling drinks  Whenever I fell asleep  I awoke with the notion I had had in the sluice-house  that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone  About midnight I got out of bed and went to Herbert  with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours  and that Wednesday was past  It was the last self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness  for after that I slept soundly   Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window  The winking lights upon the bridges were already pale  the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon  The river  still dark and mysterious  was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray  with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky  As I looked along the clustered roofs  with church-towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air  the sun rose up  and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river  and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters  From me too  a veil seemed to be drawn  and I felt strong and well   Herbert lay asleep in his bed  and our old fellow-student lay asleep on the sofa  I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the fire  which was still burning  and got some coffee ready for them  In good time they too started up strong and well  and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows  and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us    said Herbert  cheerfully  
    Chapter LIV  It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light  and winter in the shade  We had our pea-coats with us  and I took a bag  Of all my worldly possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag  Where I might go  what I might do  or when I might return  were questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them  for it was wholly set on Provis s safety  I only wondered for the passing moment  as I stopped at the door and looked back  under what altered circumstances I should next see those rooms  if ever   We loitered down to the Temple stairs  and stood loitering there  as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all  Of course  I had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order  After a little show of indecision  which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs  we went on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow  I steering  It was then about high-water --half-past eight   Our plan was this  The tide  beginning to run down at nine  and being with us until three  we intended still to creep on after it had turned  and row against it until dark  We should then be well in those long reaches below Gravesend  between Kent and Essex  where the river is broad and solitary  where the water-side inhabitants are very few  and where lone public-houses are scattered here and there  of which we could choose one for a resting-place  There  we meant to lie by all night  The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from London at about nine on Thursday morning  We should know at what time to expect them  according to where we were  and would hail the first; so that  if by any accident we were not taken abroad  we should have another chance  We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel   The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in which I had been a few hours before  The crisp air  the sunlight  the movement on the river  and the moving river itself --the road that ran with us  seeming to sympathize with us  animate us  and encourage us on --freshened me with new hope  I felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat; but  there were few better oarsmen than my two friends  and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day   At that time  the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present extent  and watermen s boats were far more numerous  Of barges  sailing colliers  and coasting-traders  there were perhaps  as many as now; but of steam-ships  great and small  not a tithe or a twentieth part so many  Early as it was  there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning  and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide; the navigation of the river between bridges  in an open boat  was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly   Old London Bridge was soon passed  and old Billingsgate Market with its oyster-boats and Dutchmen  and the White Tower and Traitor s Gate  and we were in among the tiers of shipping  Here were the Leith  Aberdeen  and Glasgow steamers  loading and unloading goods  and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here  were colliers by the score and score  with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck  as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up  which were then rattled over the side into barges; here  at her moorings was to-morrow s steamer for Rotterdam  of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow s for Hamburg  under whose bowsprit we crossed  And now I  sitting in the stern  could see  with a faster beating heart  Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs       We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment  and he was on board  and we were off again  He had a boat-cloak with him  and a black canvas bag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished   seat   Again among the tiers of shipping  in and out  avoiding rusty chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys  sinking for the moment floating broken baskets  scattering floating chips of wood and shaving  cleaving floating scum of coal  in and out  under the figure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds  as is done by many Johns   and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head; in and out  hammers going in ship-builders  yards  saws going at timber  clashing engines going at things unknown  pumps going in leaky ships  capstans going  ships going out to sea  and unintelligible sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen  in and out --out at last upon the clearer river  where the ships  boys might take their fenders in  no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side  and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind   At the stairs where we had taken him abroad  and ever since  I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected  I had seen none  We certainly had not been  and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat  If we had been waited on by any boat  I should have run in to shore  and have obliged her to go on  or to make her purpose evident  But we held our own without any appearance of molestation   He had his boat-cloak on him  and looked  as I have said  a natural part of the scene  It was remarkable  but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it  that he was the least anxious of any of us  He was not indifferent  for he told me that he hoped to live to see his gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not disposed to be passive or resigned  as I understood it; but he had no notion of meeting danger half way  When it came upon him  he confronted it  but it must come before he troubled himself    he said to me  
   said he  shaking his head gravely  
 It occurred to me as inconsistent  that  for any mastering idea  he should have endangered his freedom  and even his life  But I reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man  I was not far out  since he said  after smoking a little:--    said I  
  he returned  drawing a long breath  
  He dipped his hand in the water over the boat s gunwale  and said  smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:--  holding up his dripping hand     He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face  and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of England  Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror; for  when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat  and he was stepping out  I hinted that I thought he would be safest where he was  and he said  down again   The air felt cold upon the river  but it was a bright day  and the sunshine was very cheering  The tide ran strong  I took care to lose none of it  and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well  By imperceptible degrees  as the tide ran out  we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills  and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks  but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend  As our charge was wrapped in his cloak  I purposely passed within a boat or two s length of the floating Custom House  and so out to catch the stream  alongside of two emigrant ships  and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us  And soon the tide began to slacken  and the craft lying at anchor to swing  and presently they had all swung round  and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet  and we kept under the shore  as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could  standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks   Our oarsmen were so fresh  by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two  that a quarter of an hour s rest proved full as much as they wanted  We got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us  and looked about  It was like my own marsh country  flat and monotonous  and with a dim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned  and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned  and everything else seemed stranded and still  For now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge  straw-laden  with a brown sail  had followed; and some ballast-lighters  shaped like a child s first rude imitation of a boat  lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud  and slimy stones stuck out of the mud  and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud  and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud  and all about us was stagnation and mud   We pushed off again  and made what way we could  It was much harder work now  but Herbert and Startop persevered  and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down  By that time the river had lifted us a little  so that we could see above the bank  There was the red sun  on the low level of the shore  in a purple haze  fast deepening into black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising grounds  between which and us there seemed to be no life  save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull   As the night was fast falling  and as the moon  being past the full  would not rise early  we held a little council; a short one  for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find  So  they plied their oars once more  and I looked out for anything like a house  Thus we held on  speaking little  for four or five dull miles  It was very cold  and  a collier coming by us  with her galley-fire smoking and flaring  looked like a comfortable home  The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and what light we had  seemed to come more from the river than the sky  as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars   At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed  As the tide made  it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came  one or other of us was sure to start  and look in that direction  Here and there  the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek  and we were all suspicious of such places  and eyed them nervously  Sometimes  low voice  Or another  fall into a dead silence  and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels   At length we descried a light and a roof  and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by  Leaving the rest in the boat  I stepped ashore  and found the light to be in a window of a public-house  It was a dirty place enough  and I dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good fire in the kitchen  and there were eggs and bacon to eat  and various liquors to drink  Also  there were two double-bedded rooms --the landlord  his wife  and a grizzled male creature  the little causeway  who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low-water mark too   With this assistant  I went down to the boat again  and we all came ashore  and brought out the oars  and rudder and boat-hook  and all else  and hauled her up for the night  We made a very good meal by the kitchen fire  and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop were to occupy one; I and our charge the other  We found the air as carefully excluded from both  as if air were fatal to life; and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have thought the family possessed  But we considered ourselves well off  notwithstanding  for a more solitary place we could not have found   While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal  the Jack--who was sitting in a corner  and who had a bloated pair of shoes on  which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon  as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore--asked me if we had seen a four-oared galley going up with the tide  When I told him No  he said she must have gone down then  and yet she  Jack     said the Jack

  had washed into his throat   who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack --      In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views  the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off  looked into it  knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor  and put it on again  He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything     returned the Jack  
 pathetic way   repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt  one to reply upon  found it impracticable to pursue the subject   This dialogue made us all uneasy  and me very uneasy  The dismal wind was muttering round the house  the tide was flapping at the shore  and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened  A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of  When I had induced Provis to go up to bed  I went outside with my two companions  Startop by this time knew the state of the case   and held another council  Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer s time  which would be about one in the afternoon  or whether we should put off early in the morning  was the question we discussed  On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were  until within an hour or so of the steamer s time  and then to get out in her track  and drift easily with the tide  Having settled to do this  we returned into the house and went to bed   I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on  and slept well for a few hours  When I awoke  the wind had risen  and the sign of the house  the Ship  was creaking and banging about  with noises that startled me  Rising softly  for my charge lay fast asleep  I looked out of the window  It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat  and  as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon  I saw two men looking into her  They passed by under the window  looking at nothing else  and they did not go down to the landing-place which I could discern to be empty  but struck across the marsh in the direction of the Nore   My first impulse was to call up Herbert  and show him the two men going away  But reflecting  before I got into his room  which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine  that he and Startop had had a harder day than I  and were fatigued  I forbore  Going back to my window  I could see the two men moving over the marsh  In that light  however  I soon lost them  and  feeling very cold  lay down to think of the matter  and fell asleep again   We were up early  As we walked to and fro  all four together  before breakfast  I deemed it right to recount what I had seen  Again our charge was the least anxious of the party  It was very likely that the men belonged to the Custom House  he said quietly  and that they had no thought of us  I tried to persuade myself that it was so --as  indeed  it might easily be  However  I proposed that he and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see  and that the boat should take us aboard there  or as near there as might prove feasible  at about noon  This being considered a good precaution  soon after breakfast he and I set forth  without saying anything at the tavern   He smoked his pipe as we went along  and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder  One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger  not he  and that he was reassuring me  We spoke very little  As we approached the point  I begged him to remain in a sheltered place  while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had passed in the night  He complied  and I went on alone  There was no boat off the point  nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it  nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there  But  to be sure  the tide was high  and there might have been some footpints under water   When he looked out from his shelter in the distance  and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up  he rejoined me  and there we waited; sometimes lying on the bank  wrapped in our coats  and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves  until we saw our boat coming round  We got aboard easily  and rowed out into the track of the steamer  By that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o clock  and we began to look out for her smoke   But  it was half-past one before we saw her smoke  and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer  As they were coming on at full speed  we got the two bags ready  and took that opportunity of saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop  We had all shaken hands cordially  and neither Herbert s eyes nor mine were quite dry  when I saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us  and row out into the same track   A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer s smoke  by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible  coming head on  I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide  that she might see us lying by for her  and I adjured Provis to sit quite still  wrapped in his cloak  He answered cheerily  skilfully handled  had crossed us  let us come up with her  and fallen alongside  Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars  she kept alongside  drifting when we drifted  and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled  Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines  and looked at us attentively --as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up  much as Provis was  and seemed to shrink  and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us  Not a word was spoken in either boat   Startop could make out  after a few minutes  which steamer was first  and gave me the word She was nearing us very fast  and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder  I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us  when the galley hailed us  I answered    At the same moment  without giving any audible direction to his crew  he ran the galley abroad of us  They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead  had got their oars in  had run athwart us  and were holding on to our gunwale  before we knew what they were doing  This caused great confusion on board the steamer  and I heard them calling to us  and heard the order given to stop the paddles  and heard them stop  but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly  In the same moment  I saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner s shoulder  and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide  and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically  Still  in the same moment  I saw the prisoner start up  lean across his captor  and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley  Still in the same moment  I saw that the face disclosed  was the face of the other convict of long ago  Still  in the same moment  I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget  and heard a great cry on board the steamer  and a loud splash in the water  and felt the boat sink from under me   It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past  I was taken on board the galley  Herbert was there  and Startop was there; but our boat was gone  and the two convicts were gone   What with the cries aboard the steamer  and the furious blowing off of her steam  and her driving on  and our driving on  I could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the galley righted her with great speed  and  pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead  lay upon their oars  every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern  Presently a dark object was seen in it  bearing towards us on the tide  No man spoke  but the steersman held up his hand  and all softly backed water  and kept the boat straight and true before it  As it came nearer  I saw it to be Magwitch  swimming  but not swimming freely  He was taken on board  and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles   The galley was kept steady  and the silent  eager look-out at the water was resumed  But  the Rotterdam steamer now came up  and apparently not understanding what had happened  came on at speed  By the time she had been hailed and stopped  both steamers were drifting away from us  and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water  The look-out was kept  long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now   At length we gave it up  and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left  where we were received with no little surprise  Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch --Provis no longer --who had received some very severe injury in the Chest  and a deep cut in the head   He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer  and to have been struck on the head in rising  The injury to his chest  which rendered his breathing extremely painful  he thought he had received against the side of the galley  He added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson  but that  in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him  that villain had staggered up and staggered back  and they had both gone overboard together  when the sudden wrenching of him  Magwitch  out of our boat  and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it  had capsized us  He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other s arms  and that there had been a struggle under water  and that he had disengaged himself  struck out  and swum away   I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me  The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard   When I asked this officer s permission to change the prisoner s wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the public-house  he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him  So the pocket-book which had once been in my hands passed into the officer s  He further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to accord that grace to my two friends   The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down  and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore  His interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on  Probably  it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay   We remained at the public-house until the tide turned  and then Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board  Herbert and Startop were to get to London by land  as soon as they could  We had a doleful parting  and when I took my place by Magwitch s side  I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived   For now  my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted  wounded  shackled creature who held my hand in his  I only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor  and who had felt affectionately  gratefully  and generously  towards me with great constancy through a series of years  I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to Joe   His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on  and often he could not repress a groan  I tried to rest him on the arm I could use  in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt  since it was unquestionably best that he should die  That there were  still living  people enough who were able and willing to identify him  I could not doubt  That he would be leniently treated  I could not hope  He who had been presented in the worst light at his trial  who had since broken prison and had been tried again  who had returned from transportation under a life sentence  and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest   As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us  and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back  I told him how grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake    he answered  
 No  I had thought about that  while we had been there side by side  No  Apart from any inclinations of my own  I understood Wemmick s hint now  I foresaw that  being convicted  his possessions would be forfeited to the Crown    said he 
  said I  
 I felt his hand tremble as it held mine  and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat  and I heard that old sound in his throat --softened now  like all the rest of him  It was a good thing that he had touched this point  for it put into my mind what I might not otherwise have thought of until too late --that he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished      Chapter LV  He was taken to the Police Court next day  and would have been immediately committed for trial  but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped  to speak to his identity  Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson  who had meant to depose to it  was tumbling on the tides  dead  and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give the required evidence  I had gone direct to Mr  Jaggers at his private house  on my arrival over night  to retain his assistance  and Mr  Jaggers on the prisoner s behalf would admit nothing  It was the sole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there  and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us   I imparted to Mr  Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth  Mr  Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having by and by  and try at all events for some of it  But he did not conceal from me that  although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted  there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them  I understood that very well  I was not related to the outlaw  or connected with him by any recognizable tie; he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension  and to do so now would be idle  I had no claim  and I finally resolved  and ever afterwards abided by the resolution  that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one   There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture  and had obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch s affairs  When his body was found  many miles from the scene of his death  and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets  notes were still legible  folded in a case he carried  Among these were the name of a banking-house in New South Wales  where a sum of money was  and the designation of certain lands of considerable value  Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch  while in prison  gave to Mr  Jaggers  of the possessions he supposed I should inherit  His ignorance  poor fellow  at last served him; he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe  with Mr  Jaggers s aid   After three days  delay  during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison-ship  the witness came  and completed the easy case  He was committed to take his trial at the next Sessions  which would come on in a month   It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one evening  a good deal cast down  and said --   His partner having prepared me for that  I was less surprised than he thought       said I  
 The dreadful condition to which he was brought  was so appalling to both of us  that we could not refer to it in plainer words    said Herbert  
     I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word  so I said    There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying a portentous business exordium  he had suddenly given up that tone  stretched out his honest hand  and spoken like a schoolboy    I thanked her heartily  and I thanked him heartily  but said I could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered  Firstly  my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly  Secondly --Yes! Secondly  there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative     cried Herbert  
  said I  
 Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement  and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week     returned Herbert  
  said I  
  said Herbert; 
 On the Saturday in that same week  I took my leave of Herbert --full of bright hope  but sad and sorry to leave me --as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches  I went into a coffee-house to write a little note to Clara  telling her he had gone off  sending his love to her over and over again  and then went to my lonely home --if it deserved the name; for it was now no home to me  and I had no home anywhere   On the stairs I encountered Wemmick  who was coming down  after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door  I had not seen him alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had come  in his private and personal capacity  to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure    said Wemmick  
  scratching his head     said Wemmick  
 I invited Wemmick to come upstairs  and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth  He accepted the invitation  While he was drinking his moderate allowance  he said  with nothing to lead up to it  and after having appeared rather fidgety --     said Wemmick  
 I was about to excuse myself  as being but a bad companion just then  when Wemmick anticipated me    said he  
 He had done so much for me at various times  that this was very little to do for him  I said I could manage it --would manage it --and he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence  that I was pleased too  At his particular request  I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning  and so we parted for the time   Punctual to my appointment  I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday morning  and was received by Wemmick himself  who struck me as looking tighter than usual  and having a sleeker hat on  Within  there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared  and two biscuits  The Aged must have been stirring with the lark  for  glancing into the perspective of his bedroom  I observed that his bed was empty   When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits  and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us  I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod  and put it over his shoulder   said I  
returned Wemmick   I thought this odd; however  I said nothing  and we set off  We went towards Camberwell Green  and when we were thereabouts  Wemmick said suddenly --   There was nothing very surprising in that; but again  I was rather surprised  when he said  as if he were animated by a brilliant idea --   We went in  Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch  and looked all round  In the mean time  Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets  and getting something out of paper there    said he  
 As the gloves were white kid gloves  and as the post-office was widened to its utmost extent  I now began to have my strong suspicions  They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door  escorting a lady    said Wemmick  
 That discreet damsel was attired as usual  except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white  The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hymen  The old gentleman  however  experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on  that Wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar  and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them  while I for my part held the old gentleman round the waist  that he might present an equal and safe resistance  By dint of this ingenious scheme  his gloves were got on to perfection   The clerk and clergyman then appearing  we were ranged in order at those fatal rails  True to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation  I heard Wemmick say to himself  as he took something out of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began   I acted in the capacity of backer  or best-man  to the bridegroom; while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby s  made a feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins  The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged  which led to the clergyman s being unintentionally scandalized  and it happened thus  When he said  the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at  stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments  Upon which  the clergyman said again  gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness  the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice  that he gave  came to so gloomy a pause upon it  that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day   It was completely done  however  and when we were going out of church Wemmick took the cover off the font  and put his white gloves in it  and put the cover on again  Mrs  Wemmick  more heedful of the future  put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green  said Wemmick  triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out   Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern  a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle board in the room  in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity  It was pleasant to observe that Mrs  Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick s arm when it adapted itself to her figure  but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall  like a violoncello in its case  and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done   We had an excellent breakfast  and when any one declined anything on table  Wemmick said  saluted the bride at parting  and made myself as agreeable as I could   Wemmick came down to the door with me  and I again shook hands with him  and wished him joy    said Wemmick  rubbing his hands  
 calling me back  and speaking low  
  Wemmick nodded      Chapter LVI  He lay in prison very ill  during the whole interval between his committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions  He had broken two ribs  they had wounded one of his lungs  and he breathed with great pain and difficulty  which increased daily  It was a consequence of his hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke very little  But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the first duty of my life to say to him  and read to him  what I knew he ought to hear   Being far too ill to remain in the common prison  he was removed  after the first day or so  into the infirmary  This gave me opportunities of being with him that I could not otherwise have had  And but for his illness he would have been put in irons  for he was regarded as a determined prison-breaker  and I know not what else   Although I saw him every day  it was for only a short time; hence  the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state  I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he wasted  and became slowly weaker and worse  day by day  from the day when the prison door closed upon him   The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out  I sometimes derived an impression  from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him  that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances  But he never justified himself by a hint tending that way  or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape   It happened on two or three occasions in my presence  that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him  A smile crossed his face then  and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look  as if he were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in him  even so long ago as when I was a little child  As to all the rest  he was humble and contrite  and I never knew him complain   When the Sessions came round  Mr  Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions  It was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long  and was refused  The trial came on at once  and  when he was put to the bar  he was seated in a chair  No objection was made to my getting close to the dock  on the outside of it  and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me   The trial was very short and very clear  Such things as could be said for him were said --how he had taken to industrious habits  and had thriven lawfully and reputably  But nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned  and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury  It was impossible to try him for that  and do otherwise than find him guilty   At that time  it was the custom  as I learnt from my terrible experience of that Sessions  to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences  and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death  But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me  I could scarcely believe  even as I write these words  that I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that sentence together  Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated  that he might get breath enough to keep life in him   The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment  down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court  glittering in the rays of April sun  Penned in the dock  as I again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine  were the two-and-thirty men and women; some defiant  some stricken with terror  some sobbing and weeping  some covering their faces  some staring gloomily about  There had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been stilled  and a hush had succeeded  The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays  other civic gewgaws and monsters  criers  ushers  a great gallery full of people --a large theatrical audience --looked on  as the two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted  Then the Judge addressed them  Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws; who  after repeated imprisonments and punishments  had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years; and who  under circumstances of great violence and daring  had made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life  That miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors  when far removed from the scenes of his old offences  and to have lived a peaceable and honest life  But in a fatal moment  yielding to those propensities and passions  the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society  he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance  and had come back to the country where he was proscribed  Being here presently denounced  he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of Justice  but being at length seized while in the act of flight  he had resisted them  and had--he best knew whether by express design  or in the blindness of his hardihood--caused the death of his denouncer  to whom his whole career was known  The appointed punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out  being Death  and his case being this aggravated case  he must prepare himself to Die   The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court  through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass  and it made a broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge  linking both together  and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on  with absolute equality  to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things  and cannot err  Rising for a moment  a distinct speck of face in this way of light  the prisoner said  There was some hushing  and the Judge went on with what he had to say to the rest  Then they were all formally doomed  and some of them were supported out  and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery  and a few nodded to the gallery  and two or three shook hands  and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about  He went last of all  because of having to be helped from his chair  and to go very slowly; and he held my hand while all the others were removed  and while the audience got up  putting their dresses right  as they might at church or elsewhere   and pointed down at this criminal or at that  and most of all at him and me   I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder s Report was made; but  in the dread of his lingering on  I began that night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State  setting forth my knowledge of him  and how it was that he had come back for my sake  I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I had finished it and sent it in  I wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most merciful  and drew up one to the Crown itself  For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair  but was wholly absorbed in these appeals  And after I had sent them in  I could not keep away from the places where they were  but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when I was near them  In this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening  wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions  To the present hour  the weary western streets of London on a cold  dusty spring night  with their ranges of stern  shut-up mansions  and their long rows of lamps  are melancholy to me from this association   The daily visits I could make him were shortened now  and he was more strictly kept  Seeing  or fancying  that I was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him  I asked to be searched before I sat down at his bedside  and told the officer who was always there  that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs  Nobody was hard with him or with me  There was duty to be done  and it was done  but not harshly  The officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse  and some other sick prisoners in the room  and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses   malefactors  but not incapable of kindness  God be thanked!  always joined in the same report   As the days went on  I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling  with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant  and then it would subside again  Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak  then he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand  and I grew to understand his meaning very well   The number of the days had risen to ten  when I saw a greater change in him than I had seen yet  His eyes were turned towards the door  and lighted up as I entered    he said  as I sat down by his bed: 
  said I  
    I pressed his hand in silence  for I could not forget that I had once meant to desert him    he said  
 He lay on his back  breathing with great difficulty  Do what he would  and love me though he did  the light left his face ever and again  and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling      He had spoken his last words  He smiled  and I understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand  and lay it on his breast  I laid it there  and he smiled again  and put both his hands upon it   The allotted time ran out  while we were thus; but  looking round  I found the governor of the prison standing near me  and he whispered   I thanked him gratefully  and asked  
 The governor stepped aside  and beckoned the officer away  The change  though it was made without noise  drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling  and he looked most affectionately at me    A gentle pressure on my hand    A stronger pressure on my hand    With a last faint effort  which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it  he raised my hand to his lips  Then  he gently let it sink upon his breast again  with his own hands lying on it  The placid look at the white ceiling came back  and passed away  and his head dropped quietly on his breast   Mindful  then  of what we had read together  I thought of the two men who went up into the Temple to pray  and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside his bed  than     Chapter LVII  Now that I was left wholly to myself  I gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine  and in the meanwhile to underlet them  At once I put bills up in the windows; for  I was in debt  and had scarcely any money  and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs  I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill  The late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness  but not to put it away; I knew that it was coming on me now  and I knew very little else  and was even careless as to that   For a day or two  I lay on the sofa  or on the floor --anywhere  according as I happened to sink down --with a heavy head and aching limbs  and no purpose  and no power  Then there came  one night which appeared of great duration  and which teemed with anxiety and horror; and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it  I found I could not do so   Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night  groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror  not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp  possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs  and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking  laughing  and groaning of some one  and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room  and a voice had called out  over and over again  that Miss Havisham was consuming within it --these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order  as I lay that morning on my bed  But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them  disordering them all  and it was through the vapor at last that I saw two men looking at me    I asked  starting; 
 shoulder       said the man  
 I made some attempt to get up and dress myself  When I next attended to them  they were standing a little off from the bed  looking at me  I still lay there    said I  
 Perhaps they replied  or argued the point  or tried to encourage me to believe that I was better than I thought  Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread  I don t know what they did  except that they forbore to remove me   That I had a fever and was avoided  that I suffered greatly  that I often lost my reason  that the time seemed interminable  that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a brick in the house-wall  and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a vast engine  clashing and whirling over a gulf  and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped  and my part in it hammered off; that I passed through these phases of disease  I know of my own remembrance  and did in some sort know at the time  That I sometimes struggled with real people  in the belief that they were murderers  and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good  and would then sink exhausted in their arms  and suffer them to lay me down  I also knew at the time  But  above all  I knew that there was a constant tendency in all these people --who  when I was very ill  would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face  and would be much dilated in size --above all  I say  I knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people  sooner or later  to settle down into the likeness of Joe   After I had turned the worst point of my illness  I began to notice that while all its other features changed  this one consistent feature did not change  Whoever came about me  still settled down into Joe  I opened my eyes in the night  and I saw  in the great chair at the bedside  Joe  I opened my eyes in the day  and  sitting on the window-seat  smoking his pipe in the shaded open window  still I saw Joe  I asked for cooling drink  and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe s  I sank back on my pillow after drinking  and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe   At last  one day  I took courage  and said   And the dear old home-voice answered    For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side  and put his arm round my neck  in his joy that I knew him    said Joe  
 After which  Joe withdrew to the window  and stood with his back towards me  wiping his eyes  And as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him  I lay there  penitently whispering   Joe s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holding his hand  and we both felt happy           said Joe  
air  little grave reflection   There Joe cut himself short  and informed me that I was to be talked to in great moderation  and that I was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times  whether I felt inclined for it or not  and that I was to submit myself to all his orders  So I kissed his hand  and lay quiet  while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy  with my love in it   Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write  As I lay in bed looking at him  it made me  in my weak state  cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he set about his letter  My bedstead  divested of its curtains  had been removed  with me upon it  into the sitting-room  as the airiest and largest  and the carpet had been taken away  and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day  At my own writing-table  pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles  Joe now sat down to his great work  first choosing a pen from the pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools  and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer  It was necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow  and to get his right leg well out behind him  before he could begin; and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long  while at every upstroke I could hear his pen spluttering extensively  He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not  and constantly dipped his pen into space  and seemed quite satisfied with the result  Occasionally  he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name  and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers  he got up and hovered about the table  trying the effect of his performance from various points of view  as it lay there  with unbounded satisfaction   Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much  even if I had been able to talk much  I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day  He shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered    of getting at it by degrees     said Joe; 
  come at everything by degrees     said Joe  
if it did him infinite good   I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money more to him  and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool   This account gave me great joy  as it perfected the only good thing I had done  I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies    said Joe  
  Joe nodded  Camilla   The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me  to give me great confidence in Joe s information   said Joe  
  Joe  apologetically;    said Joe; 
 By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation  I was slow to gain strength  but I did slowly and surely become less weak  and Joe stayed with me  and I fancied I was little Pip again   For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need  that I was like a child in his hands  He would sit and talk to me in the old confidence  and with the old simplicity  and in the old unassertive protecting way  so that I would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone  He did everything for me except the household work  for which he had engaged a very decent woman  after paying off the laundress on his first arrival  explanation of that liberty;  We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride  as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship  And when the day came  and an open carriage was got into the Lane  Joe wrapped me up  took me in his arms  carried me down to it  and put me in  as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature   And Joe got in beside me  and we drove away together into the country  where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass  and sweet summer scents filled all the air  The day happened to be Sunday  and when I looked on the loveliness around me  and thought how it had grown and changed  and how the little wild-flowers had been forming  and the voices of the birds had been strengthening  by day and by night  under the sun and under the stars  while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed  the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace  But when I heard the Sunday bells  and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty  I felt that I was not nearly thankful enough --that I was too weak yet to be even that --and I laid my head on Joe s shoulder  as I had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not  and it was too much for my young senses   More composure came to me after a while  and we talked as we used to talk  lying on the grass at the old Battery  There was no change whatever in Joe  Exactly what he had been in my eyes then  he was in my eyes still; just as simply faithful  and as simply right   When we got back again  and he lifted me out  and carried me--so easily!--across the court and up the stairs  I thought of that eventful Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes  We had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune  nor did I know how much of my late history he was acquainted with  I was so doubtful of myself now  and put so much trust in him  that I could not satisfy myself whether I ought to refer to it when he did not   consideration  as he smoked his pipe at the window    returned Joe  
     diffidence     evasively at the window-seat     came to my sofa    said Joe  bending over me  
 I was ashamed to answer him    said Joe  as if I had answered; 
   said Joe  
 said Joe  in his favorite argumentative way  
   Joe assented  
   said Joe  
arrangement   The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme  and the sweet tact and kindness with which Biddy--who with her woman s wit had found me out so soon--had prepared him for it  made a deep impression on my mind  But whether Joe knew how poor I was  and how my great expectations had all dissolved  like our own marsh mists before the sun  I could not understand   Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself  but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of  was this: As I became stronger and better  Joe became a little less easy with me  In my weakness and entire dependence on him  the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone  and called me by the old names  the dear fallen into the old ways  only happy and thankful that he let me  But  imperceptibly  though I held by them fast  Joe s hold upon them began to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this  at first  I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me  and that the fault of it was all mine   Ah! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy  and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off  Had I given Joe s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got stronger  his hold upon me would be weaker  and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go  before I plucked myself away   It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Joe s arm  that I saw this change in him very plainly  We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight  looking at the river  and I chanced to say as we got up --    said Joe; 
 The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no further than the gate of the gardens  and then pretended to be weaker than I was  and asked Joe for his arm  Joe gave it me  but was thoughtful   I  for my part  was thoughtful too; for  how best to check this growing change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts  That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed  and what I had come down to  I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one  He would want to help me out of his little savings  I knew  and I knew that he ought not to help me  and that I must not suffer him to do it   It was a thoughtful evening with both of us  But  before we went to bed  I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow --to-morrow being Sunday --and would begin my new course with the new week  On Monday morning I would speak to Joe about this change  I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve  I would tell him what I had in my thoughts  that Secondly  not yet arrived at   and why I had not decided to go out to Herbert  and then the change would be conquered for ever  As I cleared  Joe cleared  and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too   We had a quiet day on the Sunday  and we rode out into the country  and then walked in the fields         said Joe  appearing a little hurried and troubled  
 At night  when I had gone to bed  Joe came into my room  as he had done all through my recovery  He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning      Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand  and said  in what I thought a husky voice   When I got up in the morning  refreshed and stronger yet  I was full of my resolution to tell Joe all  without delay  I would tell him before breakfast  I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him; for  it was the first day I had been up early  I went to his room  and he was not there  Not only was he not there  but his box was gone   I hurried then to the breakfast-table  and on it found a letter  These were its brief contents:--  P S  Ever the best of friends 
liked me very well  when my errant heart  even while it strayed away from you  was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since  If you can like me only half as well once more  if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head  if you can receive me like a forgiven child  and indeed I am as sorry  Biddy  and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand   I hope I am a little worthier of you that I was --not much  but a little  And  Biddy  it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe  or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in this country  or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which I set aside  when it was offered  until I knew your answer  And now  dear Biddy  if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me  you will surely make it a better world for me  and me a better man for it  and I will try hard to make it a better world for you expected! what else could be expected!William

In their presence 
man  what to say to Joseph  Says you     retorted Pumblechook  
  said I  
  Pumblechook went on  
hand at me   Windy donkey as he was  it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine      Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord  
 With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand  with an air  and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite leaving the house too  and when I went down the High Street I saw him holding forth  no doubt to the same effect  at his shop door to a select group  who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way   But  it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe  whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before  if that could be  contrasted with this brazen pretender  I went towards them slowly  for my limbs were weak  but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew nearer to them  and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind   The June weather was delicious  The sky was blue  the larks were soaring high over the green corn  I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet  Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there  and of the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved  beguiled my way  They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my heart was softened by my return  and such a change had come to pass  that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel  and whose wanderings had lasted many years   The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but  the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village  for quietness  sake  took me past it  I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday; no children were there  and Biddy s house was closed  Some hopeful notion of seeing her  busily engaged in her daily duties  before she saw me  had been in my mind and was defeated   But the forge was a very short distance off  and I went towards it under the sweet green limes  listening for the clink of Joe s hammer  Long after I ought to have heard it  and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy  all was still  The limes were there  and the white thorns were there  and the chestnut-trees were there  and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but  the clink of Joe s hammer was not in the midsummer wind   Almost fearing  without knowing why  to come in view of the forge  I saw it at last  and saw that it was closed  No gleam of fire  no glittering shower of sparks  no roar of bellows; all shut up  and still   But the house was not deserted  and the best parlor seemed to be in use  for there were white curtains fluttering in its window  and the window was open and gay with flowers  I went softly towards it  meaning to peep over the flowers  when Joe and Biddy stood before me  arm in arm   At first Biddy gave a cry  as if she thought it was my apparition  but in another moment she was in my embrace  I wept to see her  and she wept to see me; I  because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she  because I looked so worn and white       I looked at both of them  from one to the other  and then--   cried Biddy  in a burst of happiness  
 They had taken me into the kitchen  and I had laid my head down on the old deal table  Biddy held one of my hands to her lips  and Joe s restoring touch was on my shoulder   said Joe  And Biddy said  
overjoyed to see me  so proud to see me  so touched by my coming to them  so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day complete!  My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this last baffled hope to Joe  How often  while he was with me in my illness  had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it  if he had remained with me but another hour!   said I  
   Joe looked at me with a quivering lip  and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes    They were both melted by these words  and both entreated me to say no more     said Joe  from behind his sleeve  
   said Joe  
   ***  I sold all I had  and put aside as much as I could  for a composition with my creditors --who gave me ample time to pay them in full --and I went out and joined Herbert  Within a month  I had quitted England  and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co   and within four months I assumed my first undivided responsibility  For the beam across the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley s growls and was at peace  and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara  and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until he brought her back   Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived happily with Herbert and his wife  and lived frugally  and paid my debts  and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe  It was not until I became third in the Firm  that Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert s partnership had been long enough upon his conscience  and he must tell it  So he told it  and Herbert was as much moved as amazed  and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment  I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House  or that we made mints of money  We were not in a grand way of business  but we had a good name  and worked for our profits  and did very well  We owed so much to Herbert s ever cheerful industry and readiness  that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude  until I was one day enlightened by the reflection  that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all  but had been in me      Chapter LIX  For eleven years  I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily eyes --though they had both been often before my fancy in the East --when  upon an evening in December  an hour or two after dark  I laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door  I touched it so softly that I was not heard  and looked in unseen  There  smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight  as hale and as strong as ever  though a little gray  sat Joe; and there  fenced into the corner with Joe s leg  and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire  was--I again!  delighted  when I took another stool by the child s side  but I did not rumple his hair    I thought so too  and I took him out for a walk next morning  and we talked immensely  understanding one another to perfection  And I took him down to the churchyard  and set him on a certain tombstone there  and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip  late of this Parish  and Also Georgiana  Wife of the Above   lay sleeping in her lap    said Biddy  gently  
  Biddy looked down at her child  and put its little hand to her lips  and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine  There was something in the action  and in the light pressure of Biddy s wedding-ring  that had a very pretty eloquence in it    said Biddy

And do well  I am sure 
well I have often thought of you 
Have you 
the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth  But since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance  I have given it a place in my heart You have always held your place in my heart 
I little thought 
taking leave of this spot  I am very glad to do so the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful But you said to me 
God forgive you!  And if you could say that to me then  you will not hesitate to say that to me now --now  when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching  and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be  I have been bent and broken  but--I hope--into a better shape  Be as considerate and good to me as you were  and tell me we are friends We are friends

Villain that has ever existed pecuniary liabilities to which I have been unable to respond  I have ever been the sport and toy of debasing circumstances  Ignominy  Want  Despair  and Madness  have  collectively or separately  been the attendants of my career the office--or  as our lively neighbour the Gaul would term it  the Bureau--of the Firm  nominally conducted under the appellation of Wickfield and--HEEP  but in reality  wielded by--HEEP alone  HEEP  and only HEEP  is the mainspring of that machine  HEEP  and only HEEP  is the Forger and the Cheat the service of--HEEP twenty-two shillings and six per week  The rest was left contingent on the value of my professional exertions; in other and more expressive words  on the baseness of my nature  the cupidity of my motives  the poverty of my family  the general moral  or rather immoral  resemblance between myself and--HEEP  Need I say  that it soon became necessary for me to solicit from--HEEP--pecuniary advances towards the support of Mrs  Micawber  and our blighted but rising family  Need I say that this necessity had been foreseen by--HEEP  That those advances were secured by I O U  s and other similar acknowledgements  known to the legal institutions of this country  And that I thus became immeshed in the web he had spun for my reception confidence  as was necessary to the discharge of his infernal business  Then it was that I began  if I may so Shakespearianly express myself  to dwindle  peak  and pine  I found that my services were constantly called into requisition for the falsification of business  and the mystification of an individual whom I will designate as Mr  W  That Mr  W  was imposed upon  kept in ignorance  and deluded  in every possible way; yet  that all this while  the ruffian--HEEP--was professing unbounded gratitude to  and unbounded friendship for  that much-abused gentleman  This was bad enough; but  as the philosophic Dane observes  with that universal applicability which distinguishes the illustrious ornament of the Elizabethan Era  worse remains behind!It is not my intention 
detailed list  within the compass of the present epistle  though it is ready elsewhere   of the various malpractices of a minor nature  affecting the individual whom I have denominated Mr  W   to which I have been a tacitly consenting party  My object  when the contest within myself between stipend and no stipend  baker and no baker  existence and non-existence  ceased  was to take advantage of my opportunities to discover and expose the major malpractices committed  to that gentleman s grievous wrong and injury  by--HEEP  Stimulated by the silent monitor within  and by a no less touching and appealing monitor without--to whom I will briefly refer as Miss W --I entered on a not unlaborious task of clandestine investigation  protracted--now  to the best of my knowledge  information  and belief  over a period exceeding twelve calendar months My charges against--HEEP 
are as follows 
First 
for business became  through causes into which it is not necessary or expedient for me to enter  weakened and confused --HEEP--designedly perplexed and complicated the whole of the official transactions  When Mr  W  was least fit to enter on business --HEEP was always at hand to force him to enter on it  He obtained Mr  W  s signature under such circumstances to documents of importance  representing them to be other documents of no importance  He induced Mr  W  to empower him to draw out  thus  one particular sum of trust-money  amounting to twelve six fourteen  two and nine  and employed it to meet pretended business charges and deficiencies which were either already provided for  or had never really existed  He gave this proceeding  throughout  the appearance of having originated in Mr  W  s own dishonest intention  and of having been accomplished by Mr  W  s own dishonest act; and has used it  ever since  to torture and constrain him information  and belief--information  and belief  systematically forged  to various entries  books  and documents  the signature of Mr  W ; and has distinctly done so in one instance  capable of proof by me  To wit  in manner following  that is to say:it being within the bounds of probability that his decease might lead to some discoveries  and to the downfall of--HEEP S--power over the W  family --as I  Wilkins Micawber  the undersigned  assume--unless the filial affection of his daughter could be secretly influenced from allowing any investigation of the partnership affairs to be ever made  the said--HEEP--deemed it expedient to have a bond ready by him  as from Mr  W   for the before-mentioned sum of twelve six fourteen  two and nine  with interest  stated therein to have been advanced by--HEEP--to Mr  W  to save Mr  W  from dishonour; though really the sum was never advanced by him  and has long been replaced  The signatures to this instrument purporting to be executed by Mr  W  and attested by Wilkins Micawber  are forgeries by--HEEP  I have  in my possession  in his hand and pocket-book  several similar imitations of Mr  W  s signature  here and there defaced by fire  but legible to anyone  I never attested any such document  And I have the document itself  in my possession And I have the document 
I had  early this morning  when this was written  but have since relinquished it to Mr  Traddles books  and--HEEP S--real memoranda  beginning with the partially destroyed pocket-book  which I was unable to comprehend  at the time of its accidental discovery by Mrs  Micawber  on our taking possession of our present abode  in the locker or bin devoted to the reception of the ashes calcined on our domestic hearth   that the weaknesses  the faults  the very virtues  the parental affections  and the sense of honour  of the unhappy Mr  W  have been for years acted on by  and warped to the base purposes of--HEEP  That Mr  W  has been for years deluded and plundered  in every conceivable manner  to the pecuniary aggrandisement of the avaricious  false  and grasping--HEEP  That the engrossing object of--HEEP--was  next to gain  to subdue Mr  and Miss W   of his ulterior views in reference to the latter I say nothing  entirely to himself  That his last act  completed but a few months since  was to induce Mr  W  to execute a relinquishment of his share in the partnership  and even a bill of sale on the very furniture of his house  in consideration of a certain annuity  to be well and truly paid by--HEEP--on the four common quarter-days in each and every year  That these meshes; beginning with alarming and falsified accounts of the estate of which Mr  W  is the receiver  at a period when Mr  W  had launched into imprudent and ill-judged speculations  and may not have had the money  for which he was morally and legally responsible  in hand; going on with pretended borrowings of money at enormous interest  really coming from--HEEP--and by--HEEP--fraudulently obtained or withheld from Mr  W  himself  on pretence of such speculations or otherwise; perpetuated by a miscellaneous catalogue of unscrupulous chicaneries--gradually thickened  until the unhappy Mr  W  could see no world beyond  Bankrupt  as he believed  alike in circumstances  in all other hope  and in honour  his sole reliance was upon the monster in the garb of man destruction  All this I undertake to show  Probably much more!accusations; and then  with my ill-starred family  to disappear from the landscape on which we appear to be an encumbrance  That is soon done  It may be reasonably inferred that our baby will first expire of inanition  as being the frailest member of our circle; and that our twins will follow next in order  So be it! For myself  my Canterbury Pilgrimage has done much; imprisonment on civil process  and want  will soon do more  I trust that the labour and hazard of an investigation--of which the smallest results have been slowly pieced together  in the pressure of arduous avocations  under grinding penurious apprehensions  at rise of morn  at dewy eve  in the shadows of night  under the watchful eye of one whom it were superfluous to call Demon--combined with the struggle of parental Poverty to turn it  when completed  to the right account  may be as the sprinkling of a few drops of sweet water on my funeral pyre  I ask no more  Let it be  in justice  merely said of me  as of a gallant and eminent naval Hero  with whom I have no pretensions to cope  that what I have done  I did  in despite of mercenary and selfish objects        For England  home  and Beauty           Much affected  but still intensely enjoying himself  Mr  Micawber folded up his letter  and handed it with a bow to my aunt  as something she might like to keep   There was  as I had noticed on my first visit long ago  an iron safe in the room  The key was in it  A hasty suspicion seemed to strike Uriah; and  with a glance at Mr  Micawber  he went to it  and threw the doors clanking open  It was empty    Where are the books   he cried  with a frightful face   Some thief has stolen the books!   Mr  Micawber tapped himself with the ruler   I did  when I got the key from you as usual--but a little earlier--and opened it this morning     Don t be uneasy   said Traddles   They have come into my possession  I will take care of them  under the authority I mentioned     You receive stolen goods  do you   cried Uriah    Under such circumstances   answered Traddles   yes    What was my astonishment when I beheld my aunt  who had been profoundly quiet and attentive  make a dart at Uriah Heep  and seize him by the collar with both hands!   You know what I want   said my aunt    A strait-waistcoat   said he    No  My property!  returned my aunt   Agnes  my dear  as long as I believed it had been really made away with by your father  I wouldn t--and  my dear  I didn t  even to Trot  as he knows--breathe a syllable of its having been placed here for investment  But  now I know this fellow s answerable for it  and I ll have it! Trot  come and take it away from him!   Whether my aunt supposed  for the moment  that he kept her property in his neck-kerchief  I am sure I don t know; but she certainly pulled at it as if she thought so  I hastened to put myself between them  and to assure her that we would all take care that he should make the utmost restitution of everything he had wrongly got  This  and a few moments  reflection  pacified her; but she was not at all disconcerted by what she had done  though I cannot say as much for her bonnet  and resumed her seat composedly   During the last few minutes  Mrs  Heep had been clamouring to her son to be  umble ; and had been going down on her knees to all of us in succession  and making the wildest promises  Her son sat her down in his chair; and  standing sulkily by her  holding her arm with his hand  but not rudely  said to me  with a ferocious look:   What do you want done     I will tell you what must be done   said Traddles    Has that Copperfield no tongue   muttered Uriah   I would do a good deal for you if you could tell me  without lying  that somebody had cut it out     My Uriah means to be umble!  cried his mother   Don t mind what he says  good gentlemen!    What must be done   said Traddles   is this  First  the deed of relinquishment  that we have heard of  must be given over to me now--here     Suppose I haven t got it   he interrupted    But you have   said Traddles;  therefore  you know  we won t suppose so   And I cannot help avowing that this was the first occasion on which I really did justice to the clear head  and the plain  patient  practical good sense  of my old schoolfellow   Then   said Traddles   you must prepare to disgorge all that your rapacity has become possessed of  and to make restoration to the last farthing  All the partnership books and papers must remain in our possession; all your books and papers; all money accounts and securities  of both kinds  In short  everything here     Must it  I don t know that   said Uriah   I must have time to think about that     Certainly   replied Traddles;  but  in the meanwhile  and until everything is done to our satisfaction  we shall maintain possession of these things; and beg you--in short  compel you--to keep to your own room  and hold no communication with anyone     I won t do it!  said Uriah  with an oath    Maidstone jail is a safer place of detention   observed Traddles;  and though the law may be longer in righting us  and may not be able to right us so completely as you can  there is no doubt of its punishing YOU  Dear me  you know that quite as well as I! Copperfield  will you go round to the Guildhall  and bring a couple of officers    Here  Mrs  Heep broke out again  crying on her knees to Agnes to interfere in their behalf  exclaiming that he was very humble  and it was all true  and if he didn t do what we wanted  she would  and much more to the same purpose; being half frantic with fears for her darling  To inquire what he might have done  if he had had any boldness  would be like inquiring what a mongrel cur might do  if it had the spirit of a tiger  He was a coward  from head to foot; and showed his dastardly nature through his sullenness and mortification  as much as at any time of his mean life    Stop!  he growled to me; and wiped his hot face with his hand   Mother  hold your noise  Well! Let  em have that deed  Go and fetch it!    Do you help her  Mr  Dick   said Traddles   if you please    Proud of his commission  and understanding it  Mr  Dick accompanied her as a shepherd s dog might accompany a sheep  But  Mrs  Heep gave him little trouble; for she not only returned with the deed  but with the box in which it was  where we found a banker s book and some other papers that were afterwards serviceable    Good!  said Traddles  when this was brought   Now  Mr  Heep  you can retire to think: particularly observing  if you please  that I declare to you  on the part of all present  that there is only one thing to be done; that it is what I have explained; and that it must be done without delay    Uriah  without lifting his eyes from the ground  shuffled across the room with his hand to his chin  and pausing at the door  said:   Copperfield  I have always hated you  You ve always been an upstart  and you ve always been against me     As I think I told you once before   said I   it is you who have been  in your greed and cunning  against all the world  It may be profitable to you to reflect  in future  that there never were greed and cunning in the world yet  that did not do too much  and overreach themselves  It is as certain as death     Or as certain as they used to teach at school  the same school where I picked up so much umbleness   from nine o clock to eleven  that labour was a curse; and from eleven o clock to one  that it was a blessing and a cheerfulness  and a dignity  and I don t know what all  eh   said he with a sneer   You preach  about as consistent as they did  Won t umbleness go down  I shouldn t have got round my gentleman fellow-partner without it  I think  --Micawber  you old bully  I ll pay YOU!   Mr  Micawber  supremely defiant of him and his extended finger  and making a great deal of his chest until he had slunk out at the door  then addressed himself to me  and proffered me the satisfaction of  witnessing the re-establishment of mutual confidence between himself and Mrs  Micawber   After which  he invited the company generally to the contemplation of that affecting spectacle    The veil that has long been interposed between Mrs  Micawber and myself  is now withdrawn   said Mr  Micawber;  and my children and the Author of their Being can once more come in contact on equal terms    As we were all very grateful to him  and all desirous to show that we were  as well as the hurry and disorder of our spirits would permit  I dare say we should all have gone  but that it was necessary for Agnes to return to her father  as yet unable to bear more than the dawn of hope; and for someone else to hold Uriah in safe keeping  So  Traddles remained for the latter purpose  to be presently relieved by Mr  Dick; and Mr  Dick  my aunt  and I  went home with Mr  Micawber  As I parted hurriedly from the dear girl to whom I owed so much  and thought from what she had been saved  perhaps  that morning--her better resolution notwithstanding--I felt devoutly thankful for the miseries of my younger days which had brought me to the knowledge of Mr  Micawber   His house was not far off; and as the street door opened into the sitting-room  and he bolted in with a precipitation quite his own  we found ourselves at once in the bosom of the family  Mr  Micawber exclaiming   Emma! my life!  rushed into Mrs  Micawber s arms  Mrs  Micawber shrieked  and folded Mr  Micawber in her embrace  Miss Micawber  nursing the unconscious stranger of Mrs  Micawber s last letter to me  was sensibly affected  The stranger leaped  The twins testified their joy by several inconvenient but innocent demonstrations  Master Micawber  whose disposition appeared to have been soured by early disappointment  and whose aspect had become morose  yielded to his better feelings  and blubbered    Emma!  said Mr  Micawber   The cloud is past from my mind  Mutual confidence  so long preserved between us once  is restored  to know no further interruption  Now  welcome poverty!  cried Mr  Micawber  shedding tears   Welcome misery  welcome houselessness  welcome hunger  rags  tempest  and beggary! Mutual confidence will sustain us to the end!   With these expressions  Mr  Micawber placed Mrs  Micawber in a chair  and embraced the family all round; welcoming a variety of bleak prospects  which appeared  to the best of my judgement  to be anything but welcome to them; and calling upon them to come out into Canterbury and sing a chorus  as nothing else was left for their support   But Mrs  Micawber having  in the strength of her emotions  fainted away  the first thing to be done  even before the chorus could be considered complete  was to recover her  This my aunt and Mr  Micawber did; and then my aunt was introduced  and Mrs  Micawber recognized me    Excuse me  dear Mr  Copperfield   said the poor lady  giving me her hand   but I am not strong; and the removal of the late misunderstanding between Mr  Micawber and myself was at first too much for me     Is this all your family  ma am   said my aunt    There are no more at present   returned Mrs  Micawber    Good gracious  I didn t mean that  ma am   said my aunt   I mean  are all these yours     Madam   replied Mr  Micawber   it is a true bill     And that eldest young gentleman  now   said my aunt  musing   what has he been brought up to     It was my hope when I came here   said Mr  Micawber   to have got Wilkins into the Church: or perhaps I shall express my meaning more strictly  if I say the Choir  But there was no vacancy for a tenor in the venerable Pile for which this city is so justly eminent; and he has--in short  he has contracted a habit of singing in public-houses  rather than in sacred edifices     But he means well   said Mrs  Micawber  tenderly    I dare say  my love   rejoined Mr  Micawber   that he means particularly well; but I have not yet found that he carries out his meaning  in any given direction whatsoever    Master Micawber s moroseness of aspect returned upon him again  and he demanded  with some temper  what he was to do  Whether he had been born a carpenter  or a coach-painter  any more than he had been born a bird  Whether he could go into the next street  and open a chemist s shop  Whether he could rush to the next assizes  and proclaim himself a lawyer  Whether he could come out by force at the opera  and succeed by violence  Whether he could do anything  without being brought up to something   My aunt mused a little while  and then said:   Mr  Micawber  I wonder you have never turned your thoughts to emigration     Madam   returned Mr  Micawber   it was the dream of my youth  and the fallacious aspiration of my riper years   I am thoroughly persuaded  by the by  that he had never thought of it in his life    Aye   said my aunt  with a glance at me   Why  what a thing it would be for yourselves and your family  Mr  and Mrs  Micawber  if you were to emigrate now     Capital  madam  capital   urged Mr  Micawber  gloomily    That is the principal  I may say the only difficulty  my dear Mr  Copperfield   assented his wife    Capital   cried my aunt   But you are doing us a great service--have done us a great service  I may say  for surely much will come out of the fire--and what could we do for you  that would be half so good as to find the capital     I could not receive it as a gift   said Mr  Micawber  full of fire and animation   but if a sufficient sum could be advanced  say at five per cent interest  per annum  upon my personal liability--say my notes of hand  at twelve  eighteen  and twenty-four months  respectively  to allow time for something to turn up--    Could be  Can be and shall be  on your own terms   returned my aunt   if you say the word  Think of this now  both of you  Here are some people David knows  going out to Australia shortly  If you decide to go  why shouldn t you go in the same ship  You may help each other  Think of this now  Mr  and Mrs  Micawber  Take your time  and weigh it well     There is but one question  my dear ma am  I could wish to ask   said Mrs  Micawber   The climate  I believe  is healthy     Finest in the world!  said my aunt    Just so   returned Mrs  Micawber   Then my question arises  Now  are the circumstances of the country such  that a man of Mr  Micawber s abilities would have a fair chance of rising in the social scale  I will not say  at present  might he aspire to be Governor  or anything of that sort; but would there be a reasonable opening for his talents to develop themselves--that would be amply sufficient--and find their own expansion     No better opening anywhere   said my aunt   for a man who conducts himself well  and is industrious     For a man who conducts himself well   repeated Mrs  Micawber  with her clearest business manner   and is industrious  Precisely  It is evident to me that Australia is the legitimate sphere of action for Mr  Micawber!    I entertain the conviction  my dear madam   said Mr  Micawber   that it is  under existing circumstances  the land  the only land  for myself and family; and that something of an extraordinary nature will turn up on that shore  It is no distance--comparatively speaking; and though consideration is due to the kindness of your proposal  I assure you that is a mere matter of form    Shall I ever forget how  in a moment  he was the most sanguine of men  looking on to fortune; or how Mrs  Micawber presently discoursed about the habits of the kangaroo! Shall I ever recall that street of Canterbury on a market-day  without recalling him  as he walked back with us; expressing  in the hardy roving manner he assumed  the unsettled habits of a temporary sojourner in the land; and looking at the bullocks  as they came by  with the eye of an Australian farmer!    CHAPTER 53  ANOTHER RETROSPECT   I must pause yet once again  O  my child-wife  there is a figure in the moving crowd before my memory  quiet and still  saying in its innocent love and childish beauty  Stop to think of me--turn to look upon the Little Blossom  as it flutters to the ground!  I do  All else grows dim  and fades away  I am again with Dora  in our cottage  I do not know how long she has been ill  I am so used to it in feeling  that I cannot count the time  It is not really long  in weeks or months; but  in my usage and experience  it is a weary  weary while   They have left off telling me to  wait a few days more   I have begun to fear  remotely  that the day may never shine  when I shall see my child-wife running in the sunlight with her old friend Jip   He is  as it were suddenly  grown very old  It may be that he misses in his mistress  something that enlivened him and made him younger; but he mopes  and his sight is weak  and his limbs are feeble  and my aunt is sorry that he objects to her no more  but creeps near her as he lies on Dora s bed--she sitting at the bedside--and mildly licks her hand   Dora lies smiling on us  and is beautiful  and utters no hasty or complaining word  She says that we are very good to her; that her dear old careful boy is tiring himself out  she knows; that my aunt has no sleep  yet is always wakeful  active  and kind  Sometimes  the little bird-like ladies come to see her; and then we talk about our wedding-day  and all that happy time   What a strange rest and pause in my life there seems to be--and in all life  within doors and without--when I sit in the quiet  shaded  orderly room  with the blue eyes of my child-wife turned towards me  and her little fingers twining round my hand! Many and many an hour I sit thus; but  of all those times  three times come the freshest on my mind    It is morning; and Dora  made so trim by my aunt s hands  shows me how her pretty hair will curl upon the pillow yet  an how long and bright it is  and how she likes to have it loosely gathered in that net she wears    Not that I am vain of it  now  you mocking boy   she says  when I smile;  but because you used to say you thought it so beautiful; and because  when I first began to think about you  I used to peep in the glass  and wonder whether you would like very much to have a lock of it  Oh what a foolish fellow you were  Doady  when I gave you one!    That was on the day when you were painting the flowers I had given you  Dora  and when I told you how much in love I was     Ah! but I didn t like to tell you   says Dora   then  how I had cried over them  because I believed you really liked me! When I can run about again as I used to do  Doady  let us go and see those places where we were such a silly couple  shall we  And take some of the old walks  And not forget poor papa     Yes  we will  and have some happy days  So you must make haste to get well  my dear     Oh  I shall soon do that! I am so much better  you don t know!    It is evening; and I sit in the same chair  by the same bed  with the same face turned towards me  We have been silent  and there is a smile upon her face  I have ceased to carry my light burden up and down stairs now  She lies here all the day    Doady!    My dear Dora!    You won t think what I am going to say  unreasonable  after what you told me  such a little while ago  of Mr  Wickfield s not being well  I want to see Agnes  Very much I want to see her     I will write to her  my dear     Will you     Directly     What a good  kind boy! Doady  take me on your arm  Indeed  my dear  it s not a whim  It s not a foolish fancy  I want  very much indeed  to see her!    I am certain of it  I have only to tell her so  and she is sure to come     You are very lonely when you go downstairs  now   Dora whispers  with her arm about my neck    How can I be otherwise  my own love  when I see your empty chair     My empty chair!  She clings to me for a little while  in silence   And you really miss me  Doady   looking up  and brightly smiling   Even poor  giddy  stupid me     My heart  who is there upon earth that I could miss so much     Oh  husband! I am so glad  yet so sorry!  creeping closer to me  and folding me in both her arms  She laughs and sobs  and then is quiet  and quite happy    Quite!  she says   Only give Agnes my dear love  and tell her that I want very  very  much to see her; and I have nothing left to wish for     Except to get well again  Dora     Ah  Doady! Sometimes I think--you know I always was a silly little thing!--that that will never be!    Don t say so  Dora! Dearest love  don t think so!    I won t  if I can help it  Doady  But I am very happy; though my dear boy is so lonely by himself  before his child-wife s empty chair!    It is night; and I am with her still  Agnes has arrived; has been among us for a whole day and an evening  She  my aunt  and I  have sat with Dora since the morning  all together  We have not talked much  but Dora has been perfectly contented and cheerful  We are now alone   Do I know  now  that my child-wife will soon leave me  They have told me so; they have told me nothing new to my thoughts--but I am far from sure that I have taken that truth to heart  I cannot master it  I have withdrawn by myself  many times today  to weep  I have remembered Who wept for a parting between the living and the dead  I have bethought me of all that gracious and compassionate history  I have tried to resign myself  and to console myself; and that  I hope  I may have done imperfectly; but what I cannot firmly settle in my mind is  that the end will absolutely come  I hold her hand in mine  I hold her heart in mine  I see her love for me  alive in all its strength  I cannot shut out a pale lingering shadow of belief that she will be spared    I am going to speak to you  Doady  I am going to say something I have often thought of saying  lately  You won t mind   with a gentle look    Mind  my darling     Because I don t know what you will think  or what you may have thought sometimes  Perhaps you have often thought the same  Doady  dear  I am afraid I was too young    I lay my face upon the pillow by her  and she looks into my eyes  and speaks very softly  Gradually  as she goes on  I feel  with a stricken heart  that she is speaking of herself as past    I am afraid  dear  I was too young  I don t mean in years only  but in experience  and thoughts  and everything  I was such a silly little creature! I am afraid it would have been better  if we had only loved each other as a boy and girl  and forgotten it  I have begun to think I was not fit to be a wife    I try to stay my tears  and to reply   Oh  Dora  love  as fit as I to be a husband!    I don t know   with the old shake of her curls   Perhaps! But if I had been more fit to be married I might have made you more so  too  Besides  you are very clever  and I never was     We have been very happy  my sweet Dora     I was very happy  very  But  as years went on  my dear boy would have wearied of his child-wife  She would have been less and less a companion for him  He would have been more and more sensible of what was wanting in his home  She wouldn t have improved  It is better as it is     Oh  Dora  dearest  dearest  do not speak to me so  Every word seems a reproach!    No  not a syllable!  she answers  kissing me   Oh  my dear  you never deserved it  and I loved you far too well to say a reproachful word to you  in earnest--it was all the merit I had  except being pretty--or you thought me so  Is it lonely  down-stairs  Doady     Very! Very!    Don t cry! Is my chair there     In its old place     Oh  how my poor boy cries! Hush  hush! Now  make me one promise  I want to speak to Agnes  When you go downstairs  tell Agnes so  and send her up to me; and while I speak to her  let no one come--not even aunt  I want to speak to Agnes by herself  I want to speak to Agnes  quite alone    I promise that she shall  immediately; but I cannot leave her  for my grief    I said that it was better as it is!  she whispers  as she holds me in her arms   Oh  Doady  after more years  you never could have loved your child-wife better than you do; and  after more years  she would so have tried and disappointed you  that you might not have been able to love her half so well! I know I was too young and foolish  It is much better as it is!   Agnes is downstairs  when I go into the parlour; and I give her the message  She disappears  leaving me alone with Jip   His Chinese house is by the fire; and he lies within it  on his bed of flannel  querulously trying to sleep  The bright moon is high and clear  As I look out on the night  my tears fall fast  and my undisciplined heart is chastened heavily--heavily   I sit down by the fire  thinking with a blind remorse of all those secret feelings I have nourished since my marriage  I think of every little trifle between me and Dora  and feel the truth  that trifles make the sum of life  Ever rising from the sea of my remembrance  is the image of the dear child as I knew her first  graced by my young love  and by her own  with every fascination wherein such love is rich  Would it  indeed  have been better if we had loved each other as a boy and a girl  and forgotten it  Undisciplined heart  reply!  How the time wears  I know not; until I am recalled by my child-wife s old companion  More restless than he was  he crawls out of his house  and looks at me  and wanders to the door  and whines to go upstairs    Not tonight  Jip! Not tonight!   He comes very slowly back to me  licks my hand  and lifts his dim eyes to my face    Oh  Jip! It may be  never again!   He lies down at my feet  stretches himself out as if to sleep  and with a plaintive cry  is dead    Oh  Agnes! Look  look  here!  --That face  so full of pity  and of grief  that rain of tears  that awful mute appeal to me  that solemn hand upraised towards Heaven!   Agnes    It is over  Darkness comes before my eyes; and  for a time  all things are blotted out of my remembrance     CHAPTER 54  Mr  MICAWBER S TRANSACTIONS   This is not the time at which I am to enter on the state of my mind beneath its load of sorrow  I came to think that the Future was walled up before me  that the energy and action of my life were at an end  that I never could find any refuge but in the grave  I came to think so  I say  but not in the first shock of my grief  It slowly grew to that  If the events I go on to relate  had not thickened around me  in the beginning to confuse  and in the end to augment  my affliction  it is possible  though I think not probable   that I might have fallen at once into this condition  As it was  an interval occurred before I fully knew my own distress; an interval  in which I even supposed that its sharpest pangs were past; and when my mind could soothe itself by resting on all that was most innocent and beautiful  in the tender story that was closed for ever   When it was first proposed that I should go abroad  or how it came to be agreed among us that I was to seek the restoration of my peace in change and travel  I do not  even now  distinctly know  The spirit of Agnes so pervaded all we thought  and said  and did  in that time of sorrow  that I assume I may refer the project to her influence  But her influence was so quiet that I know no more   And now  indeed  I began to think that in my old association of her with the stained-glass window in the church  a prophetic foreshadowing of what she would be to me  in the calamity that was to happen in the fullness of time  had found a way into my mind  In all that sorrow  from the moment  never to be forgotten  when she stood before me with her upraised hand  she was like a sacred presence in my lonely house  When the Angel of Death alighted there  my child-wife fell asleep--they told me so when I could bear to hear it--on her bosom  with a smile  From my swoon  I first awoke to a consciousness of her compassionate tears  her words of hope and peace  her gentle face bending down as from a purer region nearer Heaven  over my undisciplined heart  and softening its pain   Let me go on   I was to go abroad  That seemed to have been determined among us from the first  The ground now covering all that could perish of my departed wife  I waited only for what Mr  Micawber called the  final pulverization of Heep ; and for the departure of the emigrants   At the request of Traddles  most affectionate and devoted of friends in my trouble  we returned to Canterbury: I mean my aunt  Agnes  and I  We proceeded by appointment straight to Mr  Micawber s house; where  and at Mr  Wickfield s  my friend had been labouring ever since our explosive meeting  When poor Mrs  Micawber saw me come in  in my black clothes  she was sensibly affected  There was a great deal of good in Mrs  Micawber s heart  which had not been dunned out of it in all those many years    Well  Mr  and Mrs  Micawber   was my aunt s first salutation after we were seated   Pray  have you thought about that emigration proposal of mine     My dear madam   returned Mr  Micawber   perhaps I cannot better express the conclusion at which Mrs  Micawber  your humble servant  and I may add our children  have jointly and severally arrived  than by borrowing the language of an illustrious poet  to reply that our Boat is on the shore  and our Bark is on the sea     That s right   said my aunt   I augur all sort of good from your sensible decision     Madam  you do us a great deal of honour   he rejoined  He then referred to a memorandum   With respect to the pecuniary assistance enabling us to launch our frail canoe on the ocean of enterprise  I have reconsidered that important business-point; and would beg to propose my notes of hand--drawn  it is needless to stipulate  on stamps of the amounts respectively required by the various Acts of Parliament applying to such securities--at eighteen  twenty-four  and thirty months  The proposition I originally submitted  was twelve  eighteen  and twenty-four; but I am apprehensive that such an arrangement might not allow sufficient time for the requisite amount of--Something--to turn up  We might not   said Mr  Micawber  looking round the room as if it represented several hundred acres of highly cultivated land   on the first responsibility becoming due  have been successful in our harvest  or we might not have got our harvest in  Labour  I believe  is sometimes difficult to obtain in that portion of our colonial possessions where it will be our lot to combat with the teeming soil     Arrange it in any way you please  sir   said my aunt    Madam   he replied   Mrs  Micawber and myself are deeply sensible of the very considerate kindness of our friends and patrons  What I wish is  to be perfectly business-like  and perfectly punctual  Turning over  as we are about to turn over  an entirely new leaf; and falling back  as we are now in the act of falling back  for a Spring of no common magnitude; it is important to my sense of self-respect  besides being an example to my son  that these arrangements should be concluded as between man and man    I don t know that Mr  Micawber attached any meaning to this last phrase; I don t know that anybody ever does  or did; but he appeared to relish it uncommonly  and repeated  with an impressive cough   as between man and man     I propose   said Mr  Micawber   Bills--a convenience to the mercantile world  for which  I believe  we are originally indebted to the Jews  who appear to me to have had a devilish deal too much to do with them ever since--because they are negotiable  But if a Bond  or any other description of security  would be preferred  I should be happy to execute any such instrument  As between man and man    My aunt observed  that in a case where both parties were willing to agree to anything  she took it for granted there would be no difficulty in settling this point  Mr  Micawber was of her opinion    In reference to our domestic preparations  madam   said Mr  Micawber  with some pride   for meeting the destiny to which we are now understood to be self-devoted  I beg to report them  My eldest daughter attends at five every morning in a neighbouring establishment  to acquire the process--if process it may be called--of milking cows  My younger children are instructed to observe  as closely as circumstances will permit  the habits of the pigs and poultry maintained in the poorer parts of this city: a pursuit from which they have  on two occasions  been brought home  within an inch of being run over  I have myself directed some attention  during the past week  to the art of baking; and my son Wilkins has issued forth with a walking-stick and driven cattle  when permitted  by the rugged hirelings who had them in charge  to render any voluntary service in that direction--which I regret to say  for the credit of our nature  was not often; he being generally warned  with imprecations  to desist     All very right indeed   said my aunt  encouragingly   Mrs  Micawber has been busy  too  I have no doubt     My dear madam   returned Mrs  Micawber  with her business-like air   I am free to confess that I have not been actively engaged in pursuits immediately connected with cultivation or with stock  though well aware that both will claim my attention on a foreign shore  Such opportunities as I have been enabled to alienate from my domestic duties  I have devoted to corresponding at some length with my family  For I own it seems to me  my dear Mr  Copperfield   said Mrs  Micawber  who always fell back on me  I suppose from old habit  to whomsoever else she might address her discourse at starting   that the time is come when the past should be buried in oblivion; when my family should take Mr  Micawber by the hand  and Mr  Micawber should take my family by the hand; when the lion should lie down with the lamb  and my family be on terms with Mr  Micawber    I said I thought so too    This  at least  is the light  my dear Mr  Copperfield   pursued Mrs  Micawber   in which I view the subject  When I lived at home with my papa and mama  my papa was accustomed to ask  when any point was under discussion in our limited circle  as the frigid coldness which has ever subsisted between Mr  Micawber and my family  I necessarily have formed an opinion  delusive though it may be     No doubt  Of course you have  ma am   said my aunt    Precisely so   assented Mrs  Micawber   Now  I may be wrong in my conclusions; it is very likely that I am  but my individual impression is  that the gulf between my family and Mr  Micawber may be traced to an apprehension  on the part of my family  that Mr  Micawber would require pecuniary accommodation  I cannot help thinking   said Mrs  Micawber  with an air of deep sagacity   that there are members of my family who have been apprehensive that Mr  Micawber would solicit them for their names ---I do not mean to be conferred in Baptism upon our children  but to be inscribed on Bills of Exchange  and negotiated in the Money Market    The look of penetration with which Mrs  Micawber announced this discovery  as if no one had ever thought of it before  seemed rather to astonish my aunt; who abruptly replied   Well  ma am  upon the whole  I shouldn t wonder if you were right!    Mr  Micawber being now on the eve of casting off the pecuniary shackles that have so long enthralled him   said Mrs  Micawber   and of commencing a new career in a country where there is sufficient range for his abilities --which  in my opinion  is exceedingly important; Mr  Micawber s abilities peculiarly requiring space --it seems to me that my family should signalize the occasion by coming forward  What I could wish to see  would be a meeting between Mr  Micawber and my family at a festive entertainment  to be given at my family s expense; where Mr  Micawber s health and prosperity being proposed  by some leading member of my family  Mr  Micawber might have an opportunity of developing his views     My dear   said Mr  Micawber  with some heat   it may be better for me to state distinctly  at once  that if I were to develop my views to that assembled group  they would possibly be found of an offensive nature: my impression being that your family are  in the aggregate  impertinent Snobs; and  in detail  unmitigated Ruffians     Micawber   said Mrs  Micawber  shaking her head   no! You have never understood them  and they have never understood you    Mr  Micawber coughed    They have never understood you  Micawber   said his wife   They may be incapable of it  If so  that is their misfortune  I can pity their misfortune     I am extremely sorry  my dear Emma   said Mr  Micawber  relenting   to have been betrayed into any expressions that might  even remotely  have the appearance of being strong expressions  All I would say is  that I can go abroad without your family coming forward to favour me --in short  with a parting Shove of their cold shoulders; and that  upon the whole  I would rather leave England with such impetus as I possess  than derive any acceleration of it from that quarter  At the same time  my dear  if they should condescend to reply to your communications--which our joint experience renders most improbable--far be it from me to be a barrier to your wishes    The matter being thus amicably settled  Mr  Micawber gave Mrs  Micawber his arm  and glancing at the heap of books and papers lying before Traddles on the table  said they would leave us to ourselves; which they ceremoniously did    My dear Copperfield   said Traddles  leaning back in his chair when they were gone  and looking at me with an affection that made his eyes red  and his hair all kinds of shapes   I don t make any excuse for troubling you with business  because I know you are deeply interested in it  and it may divert your thoughts  My dear boy  I hope you are not worn out     I am quite myself   said I  after a pause   We have more cause to think of my aunt than of anyone  You know how much she has done     Surely  surely   answered Traddles   Who can forget it!    But even that is not all   said I   During the last fortnight  some new trouble has vexed her; and she has been in and out of London every day  Several times she has gone out early  and been absent until evening  Last night  Traddles  with this journey before her  it was almost midnight before she came home  You know what her consideration for others is  She will not tell me what has happened to distress her    My aunt  very pale  and with deep lines in her face  sat immovable until I had finished; when some stray tears found their way to her cheeks  and she put her hand on mine    It s nothing  Trot; it s nothing  There will be no more of it  You shall know by and by  Now Agnes  my dear  let us attend to these affairs     I must do Mr  Micawber the justice to say   Traddles began   that although he would appear not to have worked to any good account for himself  he is a most untiring man when he works for other people  I never saw such a fellow  If he always goes on in the same way  he must be  virtually  about two hundred years old  at present  The heat into which he has been continually putting himself; and the distracted and impetuous manner in which he has been diving  day and night  among papers and books; to say nothing of the immense number of letters he has written me between this house and Mr  Wickfield s  and often across the table when he has been sitting opposite  and might much more easily have spoken; is quite extraordinary     Letters!  cried my aunt   I believe he dreams in letters!    There s Mr  Dick  too   said Traddles   has been doing wonders! As soon as he was released from overlooking Uriah Heep  whom he kept in such charge as I never saw exceeded  he began to devote himself to Mr  Wickfield  And really his anxiety to be of use in the investigations we have been making  and his real usefulness in extracting  and copying  and fetching  and carrying  have been quite stimulating to us     Dick is a very remarkable man   exclaimed my aunt;  and I always said he was  Trot  you know it     I am happy to say  Miss Wickfield   pursued Traddles  at once with great delicacy and with great earnestness   that in your absence Mr  Wickfield has considerably improved  Relieved of the incubus that had fastened upon him for so long a time  and of the dreadful apprehensions under which he had lived  he is hardly the same person  At times  even his impaired power of concentrating his memory and attention on particular points of business  has recovered itself very much; and he has been able to assist us in making some things clear  that we should have found very difficult indeed  if not hopeless  without him  But what I have to do is to come to results; which are short enough; not to gossip on all the hopeful circumstances I have observed  or I shall never have done   His natural manner and agreeable simplicity made it transparent that he said this to put us in good heart  and to enable Agnes to hear her father mentioned with greater confidence; but it was not the less pleasant for that    Now  let me see   said Traddles  looking among the papers on the table   Having counted our funds  and reduced to order a great mass of unintentional confusion in the first place  and of wilful confusion and falsification in the second  we take it to be clear that Mr  Wickfield might now wind up his business  and his agency-trust  and exhibit no deficiency or defalcation whatever     Oh  thank Heaven!  cried Agnes  fervently    But   said Traddles   the surplus that would be left as his means of support--and I suppose the house to be sold  even in saying this--would be so small  not exceeding in all probability some hundreds of pounds  that perhaps  Miss Wickfield  it would be best to consider whether he might not retain his agency of the estate to which he has so long been receiver  His friends might advise him  you know; now he is free  You yourself  Miss Wickfield--Copperfield--I--    I have considered it  Trotwood   said Agnes  looking to me   and I feel that it ought not to be  and must not be; even on the recommendation of a friend to whom I am so grateful  and owe so much     I will not say that I recommend it   observed Traddles   I think it right to suggest it  No more     I am happy to hear you say so   answered Agnes  steadily   for it gives me hope  almost assurance  that we think alike  Dear Mr  Traddles and dear Trotwood  papa once free with honour  what could I wish for! I have always aspired  if I could have released him from the toils in which he was held  to render back some little portion of the love and care I owe him  and to devote my life to him  It has been  for years  the utmost height of my hopes  To take our future on myself  will be the next great happiness--the next to his release from all trust and responsibility--that I can know     Have you thought how  Agnes     Often! I am not afraid  dear Trotwood  I am certain of success  So many people know me here  and think kindly of me  that I am certain  Don t mistrust me  Our wants are not many  If I rent the dear old house  and keep a school  I shall be useful and happy    The calm fervour of her cheerful voice brought back so vividly  first the dear old house itself  and then my solitary home  that my heart was too full for speech  Traddles pretended for a little while to be busily looking among the papers    Next  Miss Trotwood   said Traddles   that property of yours     Well  sir   sighed my aunt   All I have got to say about it is  that if it s gone  I can bear it; and if it s not gone  I shall be glad to get it back     It was originally  I think  eight thousand pounds  Consols   said Traddles    Right!  replied my aunt    I can t account for more than five   said Traddles  with an air of perplexity    --thousand  do you mean   inquired my aunt  with uncommon composure   or pounds     Five thousand pounds   said Traddles    It was all there was   returned my aunt   I sold three  myself  One  I paid for your articles  Trot  my dear; and the other two I have by me  When I lost the rest  I thought it wise to say nothing about that sum  but to keep it secretly for a rainy day  I wanted to see how you would come out of the trial  Trot; and you came out nobly--persevering  self-reliant  self-denying! So did Dick  Don t speak to me  for I find my nerves a little shaken!   Nobody would have thought so  to see her sitting upright  with her arms folded; but she had wonderful self-command    Then I am delighted to say   cried Traddles  beaming with joy   that we have recovered the whole money!    Don t congratulate me  anybody!  exclaimed my aunt   How so  sir     You believed it had been misappropriated by Mr  Wickfield   said Traddles    Of course I did   said my aunt   and was therefore easily silenced  Agnes  not a word!    And indeed   said Traddles   it was sold  by virtue of the power of management he held from you; but I needn t say by whom sold  or on whose actual signature  It was afterwards pretended to Mr  Wickfield  by that rascal --and proved  too  by figures --that he had possessed himself of the money  on general instructions  he said  to keep other deficiencies and difficulties from the light  Mr  Wickfield  being so weak and helpless in his hands as to pay you  afterwards  several sums of interest on a pretended principal which he knew did not exist  made himself  unhappily  a party to the fraud     And at last took the blame upon himself   added my aunt;  and wrote me a mad letter  charging himself with robbery  and wrong unheard of  Upon which I paid him a visit early one morning  called for a candle  burnt the letter  and told him if he ever could right me and himself  to do it; and if he couldn t  to keep his own counsel for his daughter s sake ---If anybody speaks to me  I ll leave the house!   We all remained quiet; Agnes covering her face    Well  my dear friend   said my aunt  after a pause   and you have really extorted the money back from him     Why  the fact is   returned Traddles   Mr  Micawber had so completely hemmed him in  and was always ready with so many new points if an old one failed  that he could not escape from us  A most remarkable circumstance is  that I really don t think he grasped this sum even so much for the gratification of his avarice  which was inordinate  as in the hatred he felt for Copperfield  He said so to me  plainly  He said he would even have spent as much  to baulk or injure Copperfield     Ha!  said my aunt  knitting her brows thoughtfully  and glancing at Agnes   And what s become of him     I don t know  He left here   said Traddles   with his mother  who had been clamouring  and beseeching  and disclosing  the whole time  They went away by one of the London night coaches  and I know no more about him; except that his malevolence to me at parting was audacious  He seemed to consider himself hardly less indebted to me  than to Mr  Micawber; which I consider  as I told him  quite a compliment     Do you suppose he has any money  Traddles   I asked    Oh dear  yes  I should think so   he replied  shaking his head  seriously   I should say he must have pocketed a good deal  in one way or other  But  I think you would find  Copperfield  if you had an opportunity of observing his course  that money would never keep that man out of mischief  He is such an incarnate hypocrite  that whatever object he pursues  he must pursue crookedly  It s his only compensation for the outward restraints he puts upon himself  Always creeping along the ground to some small end or other  he will always magnify every object in the way; and consequently will hate and suspect everybody that comes  in the most innocent manner  between him and it  So the crooked courses will become crookeder  at any moment  for the least reason  or for none  It s only necessary to consider his history here   said Traddles   to know that     He s a monster of meanness!  said my aunt    Really I don t know about that   observed Traddles thoughtfully   Many people can be very mean  when they give their minds to it     And now  touching Mr  Micawber   said my aunt    Well  really   said Traddles  cheerfully   I must  once more  give Mr  Micawber high praise  But for his having been so patient and persevering for so long a time  we never could have hoped to do anything worth speaking of  And I think we ought to consider that Mr  Micawber did right  for right s sake  when we reflect what terms he might have made with Uriah Heep himself  for his silence     I think so too   said I    Now  what would you give him   inquired my aunt    Oh! Before you come to that   said Traddles  a little disconcerted   I am afraid I thought it discreet to omit  not being able to carry everything before me  two points  in making this lawless adjustment--for it s perfectly lawless from beginning to end--of a difficult affair  Those I O U  s  and so forth  which Mr  Micawber gave him for the advances he had--    Well! They must be paid   said my aunt    Yes  but I don t know when they may be proceeded on  or where they are   rejoined Traddles  opening his eyes;  and I anticipate  that  between this time and his departure  Mr  Micawber will be constantly arrested  or taken in execution     Then he must be constantly set free again  and taken out of execution   said my aunt   What s the amount altogether     Why  Mr  Micawber has entered the transactions--he calls them transactions--with great form  in a book   rejoined Traddles  smiling;  and he makes the amount a hundred and three pounds  five     Now  what shall we give him  that sum included   said my aunt   Agnes  my dear  you and I can talk about division of it afterwards  What should it be  Five hundred pounds    Upon this  Traddles and I both struck in at once  We both recommended a small sum in money  and the payment  without stipulation to Mr  Micawber  of the Uriah claims as they came in  We proposed that the family should have their passage and their outfit  and a hundred pounds; and that Mr  Micawber s arrangement for the repayment of the advances should be gravely entered into  as it might be wholesome for him to suppose himself under that responsibility  To this  I added the suggestion  that I should give some explanation of his character and history to Mr  Peggotty  who I knew could be relied on; and that to Mr  Peggotty should be quietly entrusted the discretion of advancing another hundred  I further proposed to interest Mr  Micawber in Mr  Peggotty  by confiding so much of Mr  Peggotty s story to him as I might feel justified in relating  or might think expedient; and to endeavour to bring each of them to bear upon the other  for the common advantage  We all entered warmly into these views; and I may mention at once  that the principals themselves did so  shortly afterwards  with perfect good will and harmony   Seeing that Traddles now glanced anxiously at my aunt again  I reminded him of the second and last point to which he had adverted    You and your aunt will excuse me  Copperfield  if I touch upon a painful theme  as I greatly fear I shall   said Traddles  hesitating;  but I think it necessary to bring it to your recollection  On the day of Mr  Micawber s memorable denunciation a threatening allusion was made by Uriah Heep to your aunt s--husband    My aunt  retaining her stiff position  and apparent composure  assented with a nod    Perhaps   observed Traddles   it was mere purposeless impertinence     No   returned my aunt    There was--pardon me--really such a person  and at all in his power   hinted Traddles    Yes  my good friend   said my aunt   Traddles  with a perceptible lengthening of his face  explained that he had not been able to approach this subject; that it had shared the fate of Mr  Micawber s liabilities  in not being comprehended in the terms he had made; that we were no longer of any authority with Uriah Heep; and that if he could do us  or any of us  any injury or annoyance  no doubt he would   My aunt remained quiet; until again some stray tears found their way to her cheeks   You are quite right   she said   It was very thoughtful to mention it     Can I--or Copperfield--do anything   asked Traddles  gently    Nothing   said my aunt   I thank you many times  Trot  my dear  a vain threat! Let us have Mr  and Mrs  Micawber back  And don t any of you speak to me!  With that she smoothed her dress  and sat  with her upright carriage  looking at the door    Well  Mr  and Mrs  Micawber!  said my aunt  when they entered   We have been discussing your emigration  with many apologies to you for keeping you out of the room so long; and I ll tell you what arrangements we propose    These she explained to the unbounded satisfaction of the family --children and all being then present --and so much to the awakening of Mr  Micawber s punctual habits in the opening stage of all bill transactions  that he could not be dissuaded from immediately rushing out  in the highest spirits  to buy the stamps for his notes of hand  But  his joy received a sudden check; for within five minutes  he returned in the custody of a sheriff  s officer  informing us  in a flood of tears  that all was lost  We  being quite prepared for this event  which was of course a proceeding of Uriah Heep s  soon paid the money; and in five minutes more Mr  Micawber was seated at the table  filling up the stamps with an expression of perfect joy  which only that congenial employment  or the making of punch  could impart in full completeness to his shining face  To see him at work on the stamps  with the relish of an artist  touching them like pictures  looking at them sideways  taking weighty notes of dates and amounts in his pocket-book  and contemplating them when finished  with a high sense of their precious value  was a sight indeed    Now  the best thing you can do  sir  if you ll allow me to advise you   said my aunt  after silently observing him   is to abjure that occupation for evermore     Madam   replied Mr  Micawber   it is my intention to register such a vow on the virgin page of the future  Mrs  Micawber will attest it  I trust   said Mr  Micawber  solemnly   that my son Wilkins will ever bear in mind  that he had infinitely better put his fist in the fire  than use it to handle the serpents that have poisoned the life-blood of his unhappy parent!  Deeply affected  and changed in a moment to the image of despair  Mr  Micawber regarded the serpents with a look of gloomy abhorrence  in which his late admiration of them was not quite subdued   folded them up and put them in his pocket   This closed the proceedings of the evening  We were weary with sorrow and fatigue  and my aunt and I were to return to London on the morrow  It was arranged that the Micawbers should follow us  after effecting a sale of their goods to a broker; that Mr  Wickfield s affairs should be brought to a settlement  with all convenient speed  under the direction of Traddles; and that Agnes should also come to London  pending those arrangements  We passed the night at the old house  which  freed from the presence of the Heeps  seemed purged of a disease; and I lay in my old room  like a shipwrecked wanderer come home   We went back next day to my aunt s house--not to mine--and when she and I sat alone  as of old  before going to bed  she said:   Trot  do you really wish to know what I have had upon my mind lately     Indeed I do  aunt  If there ever was a time when I felt unwilling that you should have a sorrow or anxiety which I could not share  it is now     You have had sorrow enough  child   said my aunt  affectionately   without the addition of my little miseries  I could have no other motive  Trot  in keeping anything from you     I know that well   said I   But tell me now     Would you ride with me a little way tomorrow morning   asked my aunt    Of course     At nine   said she   I ll tell you then  my dear    At nine  accordingly  we went out in a little chariot  and drove to London  We drove a long way through the streets  until we came to one of the large hospitals  Standing hard by the building was a plain hearse  The driver recognized my aunt  and  in obedience to a motion of her hand at the window  drove slowly off; we following    You understand it now  Trot   said my aunt   He is gone!    Did he die in the hospital     Yes    She sat immovable beside me; but  again I saw the stray tears on her face    He was there once before   said my aunt presently   He was ailing a long time--a shattered  broken man  these many years  When he knew his state in this last illness  he asked them to send for me  He was sorry then  Very sorry     You went  I know  aunt     I went  I was with him a good deal afterwards     He died the night before we went to Canterbury   said I  My aunt nodded   No one can harm him now   she said   It was a vain threat    We drove away  out of town  to the churchyard at Hornsey   Better here than in the streets   said my aunt   He was born here    We alighted; and followed the plain coffin to a corner I remember well  where the service was read consigning it to the dust    Six-and-thirty years ago  this day  my dear   said my aunt  as we walked back to the chariot   I was married  God forgive us all!  We took our seats in silence; and so she sat beside me for a long time  holding my hand  At length she suddenly burst into tears  and said:   He was a fine-looking man when I married him  Trot--and he was sadly changed!   It did not last long  After the relief of tears  she soon became composed  and even cheerful  Her nerves were a little shaken  she said  or she would not have given way to it  God forgive us all!  So we rode back to her little cottage at Highgate  where we found the following short note  which had arrived by that morning s post from Mr  Micawber:              Canterbury                   Friday    My dear Madam  and Copperfield    The fair land of promise lately looming on the horizon is again enveloped in impenetrable mists  and for ever withdrawn from the eyes of a drifting wretch whose Doom is sealed!   Another writ has been issued  in His Majesty s High Court of King s Bench at Westminster   in another cause of HEEP V  MICAWBER  and the defendant in that cause is the prey of the sheriff having legal jurisdiction in this bailiwick         Now s the day  and now s the hour       See the front of battle lower       See approach proud EDWARD S power--      Chains and slavery!   Consigned to which  and to a speedy end  for mental torture is not supportable beyond a certain point  and that point I feel I have attained   my course is run  Bless you  bless you! Some future traveller  visiting  from motives of curiosity  not unmingled  let us hope  with sympathy  the place of confinement allotted to debtors in this city  may  and I trust will  Ponder  as he traces on its wall  inscribed with a rusty nail                                  The obscure initials                                       W  M    P S  I re-open this to say that our common friend  Mr  Thomas Traddles  who has not yet left us  and is looking extremely well   has paid the debt and costs  in the noble name of Miss Trotwood; and that myself and family are at the height of earthly bliss      CHAPTER 55  TEMPEST   I now approach an event in my life  so indelible  so awful  so bound by an infinite variety of ties to all that has preceded it  in these pages  that  from the beginning of my narrative  I have seen it growing larger and larger as I advanced  like a great tower in a plain  and throwing its fore-cast shadow even on the incidents of my childish days   For years after it occurred  I dreamed of it often  I have started up so vividly impressed by it  that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet room  in the still night  I dream of it sometimes  though at lengthened and uncertain intervals  to this hour  I have an association between it and a stormy wind  or the lightest mention of a sea-shore  as strong as any of which my mind is conscious  As plainly as I behold what happened  I will try to write it down  I do not recall it  but see it done; for it happens again before me   The time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrant-ship  my good old nurse  almost broken-hearted for me  when we first met  came up to London  I was constantly with her  and her brother  and the Micawbers  they being very much together ; but Emily I never saw   One evening when the time was close at hand  I was alone with Peggotty and her brother  Our conversation turned on Ham  She described to us how tenderly he had taken leave of her  and how manfully and quietly he had borne himself  Most of all  of late  when she believed he was most tried  It was a subject of which the affectionate creature never tired; and our interest in hearing the many examples which she  who was so much with him  had to relate  was equal to hers in relating them   My aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at Highgate; I intending to go abroad  and she to return to her house at Dover  We had a temporary lodging in Covent Garden  As I walked home to it  after this evening s conversation  reflecting on what had passed between Ham and myself when I was last at Yarmouth  I wavered in the original purpose I had formed  of leaving a letter for Emily when I should take leave of her uncle on board the ship  and thought it would be better to write to her now  She might desire  I thought  after receiving my communication  to send some parting word by me to her unhappy lover  I ought to give her the opportunity   I therefore sat down in my room  before going to bed  and wrote to her  I told her that I had seen him  and that he had requested me to tell her what I have already written in its place in these sheets  I faithfully repeated it  I had no need to enlarge upon it  if I had had the right  Its deep fidelity and goodness were not to be adorned by me or any man  I left it out  to be sent round in the morning; with a line to Mr  Peggotty  requesting him to give it to her; and went to bed at daybreak   I was weaker than I knew then; and  not falling asleep until the sun was up  lay late  and unrefreshed  next day  I was roused by the silent presence of my aunt at my bedside  I felt it in my sleep  as I suppose we all do feel such things    Trot  my dear   she said  when I opened my eyes   I couldn t make up my mind to disturb you  Mr  Peggotty is here; shall he come up    I replied yes  and he soon appeared    Mas r Davy   he said  when we had shaken hands   I giv Em ly your letter  sir  and she writ this heer; and begged of me fur to ask you to read it  and if you see no hurt in t  to be so kind as take charge on t     Have you read it   said I   He nodded sorrowfully  I opened it  and read as follows:    I have got your message  Oh  what can I write  to thank you for your good and blessed kindness to me!   I have put the words close to my heart  I shall keep them till I die  They are sharp thorns  but they are such comfort  I have prayed over them  oh  I have prayed so much  When I find what you are  and what uncle is  I think what God must be  and can cry to him    Good-bye for ever  Now  my dear  my friend  good-bye for ever in this world  In another world  if I am forgiven  I may wake a child and come to you  All thanks and blessings  Farewell  evermore     This  blotted with tears  was the letter    May I tell her as you doen t see no hurt in t  and as you ll be so kind as take charge on t  Mas r Davy   said Mr  Peggotty  when I had read it   Unquestionably   said I-- but I am thinking--    Yes  Mas r Davy     I am thinking   said I   that I ll go down again to Yarmouth  There s time  and to spare  for me to go and come back before the ship sails  My mind is constantly running on him  in his solitude; to put this letter of her writing in his hand at this time  and to enable you to tell her  in the moment of parting  that he has got it  will be a kindness to both of them  I solemnly accepted his commission  dear good fellow  and cannot discharge it too completely  The journey is nothing to me  I am restless  and shall be better in motion  I ll go down tonight    Though he anxiously endeavoured to dissuade me  I saw that he was of my mind; and this  if I had required to be confirmed in my intention  would have had the effect  He went round to the coach office  at my request  and took the box-seat for me on the mail  In the evening I started  by that conveyance  down the road I had traversed under so many vicissitudes    Don t you think that   I asked the coachman  in the first stage out of London   a very remarkable sky  I don t remember to have seen one like it     Nor I--not equal to it   he replied   That s wind  sir  There ll be mischief done at sea  I expect  before long    It was a murky confusion--here and there blotted with a colour like the colour of the smoke from damp fuel--of flying clouds  tossed up into most remarkable heaps  suggesting greater heights in the clouds than there were depths below them to the bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth  through which the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong  as if  in a dread disturbance of the laws of nature  she had lost her way and were frightened  There had been a wind all day; and it was rising then  with an extraordinary great sound  In another hour it had much increased  and the sky was more overcast  and blew hard   But  as the night advanced  the clouds closing in and densely over-spreading the whole sky  then very dark  it came on to blow  harder and harder  It still increased  until our horses could scarcely face the wind  Many times  in the dark part of the night  it was then late in September  when the nights were not short   the leaders turned about  or came to a dead stop; and we were often in serious apprehension that the coach would be blown over  Sweeping gusts of rain came up before this storm  like showers of steel; and  at those times  when there was any shelter of trees or lee walls to be got  we were fain to stop  in a sheer impossibility of continuing the struggle   When the day broke  it blew harder and harder  I had been in Yarmouth when the seamen said it blew great guns  but I had never known the like of this  or anything approaching to it  We came to Ipswich--very late  having had to fight every inch of ground since we were ten miles out of London; and found a cluster of people in the market-place  who had risen from their beds in the night  fearful of falling chimneys  Some of these  congregating about the inn-yard while we changed horses  told us of great sheets of lead having been ripped off a high church-tower  and flung into a by-street  which they then blocked up  Others had to tell of country people  coming in from neighbouring villages  who had seen great trees lying torn out of the earth  and whole ricks scattered about the roads and fields  Still  there was no abatement in the storm  but it blew harder   As we struggled on  nearer and nearer to the sea  from which this mighty wind was blowing dead on shore  its force became more and more terrific  Long before we saw the sea  its spray was on our lips  and showered salt rain upon us  The water was out  over miles and miles of the flat country adjacent to Yarmouth; and every sheet and puddle lashed its banks  and had its stress of little breakers setting heavily towards us  When we came within sight of the sea  the waves on the horizon  caught at intervals above the rolling abyss  were like glimpses of another shore with towers and buildings  When at last we got into the town  the people came out to their doors  all aslant  and with streaming hair  making a wonder of the mail that had come through such a night   I put up at the old inn  and went down to look at the sea; staggering along the street  which was strewn with sand and seaweed  and with flying blotches of sea-foam; afraid of falling slates and tiles; and holding by people I met  at angry corners  Coming near the beach  I saw  not only the boatmen  but half the people of the town  lurking behind buildings; some  now and then braving the fury of the storm to look away to sea  and blown sheer out of their course in trying to get zigzag back   Joining these groups  I found bewailing women whose husbands were away in herring or oyster boats  which there was too much reason to think might have foundered before they could run in anywhere for safety  Grizzled old sailors were among the people  shaking their heads  as they looked from water to sky  and muttering to one another; ship-owners  excited and uneasy; children  huddling together  and peering into older faces; even stout mariners  disturbed and anxious  levelling their glasses at the sea from behind places of shelter  as if they were surveying an enemy   The tremendous sea itself  when I could find sufficient pause to look at it  in the agitation of the blinding wind  the flying stones and sand  and the awful noise  confounded me  As the high watery walls came rolling in  and  at their highest  tumbled into surf  they looked as if the least would engulf the town  As the receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar  it seemed to scoop out deep caves in the beach  as if its purpose were to undermine the earth  When some white-headed billows thundered on  and dashed themselves to pieces before they reached the land  every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed by the full might of its wrath  rushing to be gathered to the composition of another monster  Undulating hills were changed to valleys  undulating valleys  with a solitary storm-bird sometimes skimming through them  were lifted up to hills; masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a booming sound; every shape tumultuously rolled on  as soon as made  to change its shape and place  and beat another shape and place away; the ideal shore on the horizon  with its towers and buildings  rose and fell; the clouds fell fast and thick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of all nature   Not finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind--for it is still remembered down there  as the greatest ever known to blow upon that coast--had brought together  I made my way to his house  It was shut; and as no one answered to my knocking  I went  by back ways and by-lanes  to the yard where he worked  I learned  there  that he had gone to Lowestoft  to meet some sudden exigency of ship-repairing in which his skill was required; but that he would be back tomorrow morning  in good time   I went back to the inn; and when I had washed and dressed  and tried to sleep  but in vain  it was five o clock in the afternoon  I had not sat five minutes by the coffee-room fire  when the waiter  coming to stir it  as an excuse for talking  told me that two colliers had gone down  with all hands  a few miles away; and that some other ships had been seen labouring hard in the Roads  and trying  in great distress  to keep off shore  Mercy on them  and on all poor sailors  said he  if we had another night like the last!  I was very much depressed in spirits; very solitary; and felt an uneasiness in Ham s not being there  disproportionate to the occasion  I was seriously affected  without knowing how much  by late events; and my long exposure to the fierce wind had confused me  There was that jumble in my thoughts and recollections  that I had lost the clear arrangement of time and distance  Thus  if I had gone out into the town  I should not have been surprised  I think  to encounter someone who I knew must be then in London  So to speak  there was in these respects a curious inattention in my mind  Yet it was busy  too  with all the remembrances the place naturally awakened; and they were particularly distinct and vivid   In this state  the waiter s dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself  without any effort of my volition  with my uneasiness about Ham  I was persuaded that I had an apprehension of his returning from Lowestoft by sea  and being lost  This grew so strong with me  that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner  and ask the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at all likely  If he gave me the least reason to think so  I would go over to Lowestoft and prevent it by bringing him with me   I hastily ordered my dinner  and went back to the yard  I was none too soon; for the boat-builder  with a lantern in his hand  was locking the yard-gate  He quite laughed when I asked him the question  and said there was no fear; no man in his senses  or out of them  would put off in such a gale of wind  least of all Ham Peggotty  who had been born to seafaring   So sensible of this  beforehand  that I had really felt ashamed of doing what I was nevertheless impelled to do  I went back to the inn  If such a wind could rise  I think it was rising  The howl and roar  the rattling of the doors and windows  the rumbling in the chimneys  the apparent rocking of the very house that sheltered me  and the prodigious tumult of the sea  were more fearful than in the morning  But there was now a great darkness besides; and that invested the storm with new terrors  real and fanciful   I could not eat  I could not sit still  I could not continue steadfast to anything  Something within me  faintly answering to the storm without  tossed up the depths of my memory and made a tumult in them  Yet  in all the hurry of my thoughts  wild running with the thundering sea --the storm  and my uneasiness regarding Ham were always in the fore-ground   My dinner went away almost untasted  and I tried to refresh myself with a glass or two of wine  In vain  I fell into a dull slumber before the fire  without losing my consciousness  either of the uproar out of doors  or of the place in which I was  Both became overshadowed by a new and indefinable horror; and when I awoke--or rather when I shook off the lethargy that bound me in my chair--my whole frame thrilled with objectless and unintelligible fear   I walked to and fro  tried to read an old gazetteer  listened to the awful noises: looked at faces  scenes  and figures in the fire  At length  the steady ticking of the undisturbed clock on the wall tormented me to that degree that I resolved to go to bed   It was reassuring  on such a night  to be told that some of the inn-servants had agreed together to sit up until morning  I went to bed  exceedingly weary and heavy; but  on my lying down  all such sensations vanished  as if by magic  and I was broad awake  with every sense refined   For hours I lay there  listening to the wind and water; imagining  now  that I heard shrieks out at sea; now  that I distinctly heard the firing of signal guns; and now  the fall of houses in the town  I got up  several times  and looked out; but could see nothing  except the reflection in the window-panes of the faint candle I had left burning  and of my own haggard face looking in at me from the black void   At length  my restlessness attained to such a pitch  that I hurried on my clothes  and went downstairs  In the large kitchen  where I dimly saw bacon and ropes of onions hanging from the beams  the watchers were clustered together  in various attitudes  about a table  purposely moved away from the great chimney  and brought near the door  A pretty girl  who had her ears stopped with her apron  and her eyes upon the door  screamed when I appeared  supposing me to be a spirit; but the others had more presence of mind  and were glad of an addition to their company  One man  referring to the topic they had been discussing  asked me whether I thought the souls of the collier-crews who had gone down  were out in the storm   I remained there  I dare say  two hours  Once  I opened the yard-gate  and looked into the empty street  The sand  the sea-weed  and the flakes of foam  were driving by; and I was obliged to call for assistance before I could shut the gate again  and make it fast against the wind   There was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber  when I at length returned to it; but I was tired now  and  getting into bed again  fell--off a tower and down a precipice--into the depths of sleep  I have an impression that for a long time  though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes  it was always blowing in my dream  At length  I lost that feeble hold upon reality  and was engaged with two dear friends  but who they were I don t know  at the siege of some town in a roar of cannonading   The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant  that I could not hear something I much desired to hear  until I made a great exertion and awoke  It was broad day--eight or nine o clock; the storm raging  in lieu of the batteries; and someone knocking and calling at my door    What is the matter   I cried    A wreck! Close by!   I sprung out of bed  and asked  what wreck    A schooner  from Spain or Portugal  laden with fruit and wine  Make haste  sir  if you want to see her! It s thought  down on the beach  she ll go to pieces every moment    The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase; and I wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as I could  and ran into the street   Numbers of people were there before me  all running in one direction  to the beach  I ran the same way  outstripping a good many  and soon came facing the wild sea   The wind might by this time have lulled a little  though not more sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of  had been diminished by the silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds  But the sea  having upon it the additional agitation of the whole night  was infinitely more terrific than when I had seen it last  Every appearance it had then presented  bore the expression of being swelled; and the height to which the breakers rose  and  looking over one another  bore one another down  and rolled in  in interminable hosts  was most appalling  In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves  and in the crowd  and the unspeakable confusion  and my first breathless efforts to stand against the weather  I was so confused that I looked out to sea for the wreck  and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves  A half-dressed boatman  standing next me  pointed with his bare arm  a tattoo d arrow on it  pointing in the same direction  to the left  Then  O great Heaven  I saw it  close in upon us!  One mast was broken short off  six or eight feet from the deck  and lay over the side  entangled in a maze of sail and rigging; and all that ruin  as the ship rolled and beat--which she did without a moment s pause  and with a violence quite inconceivable--beat the side as if it would stave it in  Some efforts were even then being made  to cut this portion of the wreck away; for  as the ship  which was broadside on  turned towards us in her rolling  I plainly descried her people at work with axes  especially one active figure with long curling hair  conspicuous among the rest  But a great cry  which was audible even above the wind and water  rose from the shore at this moment; the sea  sweeping over the rolling wreck  made a clean breach  and carried men  spars  casks  planks  bulwarks  heaps of such toys  into the boiling surge   The second mast was yet standing  with the rags of a rent sail  and a wild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro  The ship had struck once  the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear  and then lifted in and struck again  I understood him to add that she was parting amidships  and I could readily suppose so  for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human work to suffer long  As he spoke  there was another great cry of pity from the beach; four men arose with the wreck out of the deep  clinging to the rigging of the remaining mast; uppermost  the active figure with the curling hair   There was a bell on board; and as the ship rolled and dashed  like a desperate creature driven mad  now showing us the whole sweep of her deck  as she turned on her beam-ends towards the shore  now nothing but her keel  as she sprung wildly over and turned towards the sea  the bell rang; and its sound  the knell of those unhappy men  was borne towards us on the wind  Again we lost her  and again she rose  Two men were gone  The agony on the shore increased  Men groaned  and clasped their hands; women shrieked  and turned away their faces  Some ran wildly up and down along the beach  crying for help where no help could be  I found myself one of these  frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom I knew  not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes   They were making out to me  in an agitated way--I don t know how  for the little I could hear I was scarcely composed enough to understand--that the lifeboat had been bravely manned an hour ago  and could do nothing; and that as no man would be so desperate as to attempt to wade off with a rope  and establish a communication with the shore  there was nothing left to try; when I noticed that some new sensation moved the people on the beach  and saw them part  and Ham come breaking through them to the front   I ran to him--as well as I know  to repeat my appeal for help  But  distracted though I was  by a sight so new to me and terrible  the determination in his face  and his look out to sea--exactly the same look as I remembered in connexion with the morning after Emily s flight--awoke me to a knowledge of his danger  I held him back with both arms; and implored the men with whom I had been speaking  not to listen to him  not to do murder  not to let him stir from off that sand!  Another cry arose on shore; and looking to the wreck  we saw the cruel sail  with blow on blow  beat off the lower of the two men  and fly up in triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast   Against such a sight  and against such determination as that of the calmly desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half the people present  I might as hopefully have entreated the wind   Mas r Davy   he said  cheerily grasping me by both hands   if my time is come   tis come  If  tan t  I ll bide it  Lord above bless you  and bless all! Mates  make me ready! I m a-going off!   I was swept away  but not unkindly  to some distance  where the people around me made me stay; urging  as I confusedly perceived  that he was bent on going  with help or without  and that I should endanger the precautions for his safety by troubling those with whom they rested  I don t know what I answered  or what they rejoined; but I saw hurry on the beach  and men running with ropes from a capstan that was there  and penetrating into a circle of figures that hid him from me  Then  I saw him standing alone  in a seaman s frock and trousers: a rope in his hand  or slung to his wrist: another round his body: and several of the best men holding  at a little distance  to the latter  which he laid out himself  slack upon the shore  at his feet   The wreck  even to my unpractised eye  was breaking up  I saw that she was parting in the middle  and that the life of the solitary man upon the mast hung by a thread  Still  he clung to it  He had a singular red cap on --not like a sailor s cap  but of a finer colour; and as the few yielding planks between him and destruction rolled and bulged  and his anticipative death-knell rung  he was seen by all of us to wave it  I saw him do it now  and thought I was going distracted  when his action brought an old remembrance to my mind of a once dear friend   Ham watched the sea  standing alone  with the silence of suspended breath behind him  and the storm before  until there was a great retiring wave  when  with a backward glance at those who held the rope which was made fast round his body  he dashed in after it  and in a moment was buffeting with the water; rising with the hills  falling with the valleys  lost beneath the foam; then drawn again to land  They hauled in hastily   He was hurt  I saw blood on his face  from where I stood; but he took no thought of that  He seemed hurriedly to give them some directions for leaving him more free--or so I judged from the motion of his arm--and was gone as before   And now he made for the wreck  rising with the hills  falling with the valleys  lost beneath the rugged foam  borne in towards the shore  borne on towards the ship  striving hard and valiantly  The distance was nothing  but the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly  At length he neared the wreck  He was so near  that with one more of his vigorous strokes he would be clinging to it --when a high  green  vast hill-side of water  moving on shoreward  from beyond the ship  he seemed to leap up into it with a mighty bound  and the ship was gone!  Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea  as if a mere cask had been broken  in running to the spot where they were hauling in  Consternation was in every face  They drew him to my very feet--insensible--dead  He was carried to the nearest house; and  no one preventing me now  I remained near him  busy  while every means of restoration were tried; but he had been beaten to death by the great wave  and his generous heart was stilled for ever   As I sat beside the bed  when hope was abandoned and all was done  a fisherman  who had known me when Emily and I were children  and ever since  whispered my name at the door    Sir   said he  with tears starting to his weather-beaten face  which  with his trembling lips  was ashy pale   will you come over yonder    The old remembrance that had been recalled to me  was in his look  I asked him  terror-stricken  leaning on the arm he held out to support me:   Has a body come ashore    He said   Yes     Do I know it   I asked then   He answered nothing   But he led me to the shore  And on that part of it where she and I had looked for shells  two children--on that part of it where some lighter fragments of the old boat  blown down last night  had been scattered by the wind--among the ruins of the home he had wronged--I saw him lying with his head upon his arm  as I had often seen him lie at school     CHAPTER 56  THE NEW WOUND  AND THE OLD  No need  O Steerforth  to have said  when we last spoke together  in that hour which I so little deemed to be our parting-hour--no need to have said   Think of me at my best!  I had done that ever; and could I change now  looking on this sight!  They brought a hand-bier  and laid him on it  and covered him with a flag  and took him up and bore him on towards the houses  All the men who carried him had known him  and gone sailing with him  and seen him merry and bold  They carried him through the wild roar  a hush in the midst of all the tumult; and took him to the cottage where Death was already   But when they set the bier down on the threshold  they looked at one another  and at me  and whispered  I knew why  They felt as if it were not right to lay him down in the same quiet room   We went into the town  and took our burden to the inn  So soon as I could at all collect my thoughts  I sent for Joram  and begged him to provide me a conveyance in which it could be got to London in the night  I knew that the care of it  and the hard duty of preparing his mother to receive it  could only rest with me; and I was anxious to discharge that duty as faithfully as I could   I chose the night for the journey  that there might be less curiosity when I left the town  But  although it was nearly midnight when I came out of the yard in a chaise  followed by what I had in charge  there were many people waiting  At intervals  along the town  and even a little way out upon the road  I saw more: but at length only the bleak night and the open country were around me  and the ashes of my youthful friendship   Upon a mellow autumn day  about noon  when the ground was perfumed by fallen leaves  and many more  in beautiful tints of yellow  red  and brown  yet hung upon the trees  through which the sun was shining  I arrived at Highgate  I walked the last mile  thinking as I went along of what I had to do; and left the carriage that had followed me all through the night  awaiting orders to advance   The house  when I came up to it  looked just the same  Not a blind was raised; no sign of life was in the dull paved court  with its covered way leading to the disused door  The wind had quite gone down  and nothing moved   I had not  at first  the courage to ring at the gate; and when I did ring  my errand seemed to me to be expressed in the very sound of the bell  The little parlour-maid came out  with the key in her hand; and looking earnestly at me as she unlocked the gate  said:   I beg your pardon  sir  Are you ill     I have been much agitated  and am fatigued     Is anything the matter  sir ---Mr  James --   Hush!  said I   Yes  something has happened  that I have to break to Mrs  Steerforth  She is at home    The girl anxiously replied that her mistress was very seldom out now  even in a carriage; that she kept her room; that she saw no company  but would see me  Her mistress was up  she said  and Miss Dartle was with her  What message should she take upstairs   Giving her a strict charge to be careful of her manner  and only to carry in my card and say I waited  I sat down in the drawing-room  which we had now reached  until she should come back  Its former pleasant air of occupation was gone  and the shutters were half closed  The harp had not been used for many and many a day  His picture  as a boy  was there  The cabinet in which his mother had kept his letters was there  I wondered if she ever read them now; if she would ever read them more!  The house was so still that I heard the girl s light step upstairs  On her return  she brought a message  to the effect that Mrs  Steerforth was an invalid and could not come down; but that if I would excuse her being in her chamber  she would be glad to see me  In a few moments I stood before her   She was in his room; not in her own  I felt  of course  that she had taken to occupy it  in remembrance of him; and that the many tokens of his old sports and accomplishments  by which she was surrounded  remained there  just as he had left them  for the same reason  She murmured  however  even in her reception of me  that she was out of her own chamber because its aspect was unsuited to her infirmity; and with her stately look repelled the least suspicion of the truth   At her chair  as usual  was Rosa Dartle  From the first moment of her dark eyes resting on me  I saw she knew I was the bearer of evil tidings  The scar sprung into view that instant  She withdrew herself a step behind the chair  to keep her own face out of Mrs  Steerforth s observation; and scrutinized me with a piercing gaze that never faltered  never shrunk    I am sorry to observe you are in mourning  sir   said Mrs  Steerforth    I am unhappily a widower   said I    You are very young to know so great a loss   she returned   I am grieved to hear it  I am grieved to hear it  I hope Time will be good to you     I hope Time   said I  looking at her   will be good to all of us  Dear Mrs  Steerforth  we must all trust to that  in our heaviest misfortunes    The earnestness of my manner  and the tears in my eyes  alarmed her  The whole course of her thoughts appeared to stop  and change   I tried to command my voice in gently saying his name  but it trembled  She repeated it to herself  two or three times  in a low tone  Then  addressing me  she said  with enforced calmness:   My son is ill     Very ill     You have seen him     I have     Are you reconciled    I could not say Yes  I could not say No  She slightly turned her head towards the spot where Rosa Dartle had been standing at her elbow  and in that moment I said  by the motion of my lips  to Rosa   Dead!   That Mrs  Steerforth might not be induced to look behind her  and read  plainly written  what she was not yet prepared to know  I met her look quickly; but I had seen Rosa Dartle throw her hands up in the air with vehemence of despair and horror  and then clasp them on her face   The handsome lady--so like  oh so like!--regarded me with a fixed look  and put her hand to her forehead  I besought her to be calm  and prepare herself to bear what I had to tell; but I should rather have entreated her to weep  for she sat like a stone figure    When I was last here   I faltered   Miss Dartle told me he was sailing here and there  The night before last was a dreadful one at sea  If he were at sea that night  and near a dangerous coast  as it is said he was; and if the vessel that was seen should really be the ship which--    Rosa!  said Mrs  Steerforth   come to me!   She came  but with no sympathy or gentleness  Her eyes gleamed like fire as she confronted his mother  and broke into a frightful laugh    Now   she said   is your pride appeased  you madwoman  Now has he made atonement to you--with his life! Do you hear ---His life!   Mrs  Steerforth  fallen back stiffly in her chair  and making no sound but a moan  cast her eyes upon her with a wide stare    Aye!  cried Rosa  smiting herself passionately on the breast   look at me! Moan  and groan  and look at me! Look here!  striking the scar   at your dead child s handiwork!   The moan the mother uttered  from time to time  went to My heart  Always the same  Always inarticulate and stifled  Always accompanied with an incapable motion of the head  but with no change of face  Always proceeding from a rigid mouth and closed teeth  as if the jaw were locked and the face frozen up in pain    Do you remember when he did this   she proceeded   Do you remember when  in his inheritance of your nature  and in your pampering of his pride and passion  he did this  and disfigured me for life  Look at me  marked until I die with his high displeasure; and moan and groan for what you made him!    Miss Dartle   I entreated her   For Heaven s sake--    I WILL speak!  she said  turning on me with her lightning eyes   Be silent  you! Look at me  I say  proud mother of a proud  false son! Moan for your nurture of him  moan for your corruption of him  moan for your loss of him  moan for mine!   She clenched her hand  and trembled through her spare  worn figure  as if her passion were killing her by inches    You  resent his self-will!  she exclaimed   You  injured by his haughty temper! You  who opposed to both  when your hair was grey  the qualities which made both when you gave him birth! YOU  who from his cradle reared him to be what he was  and stunted what he should have been! Are you rewarded  now  for your years of trouble     Oh  Miss Dartle  shame! Oh cruel!    I tell you   she returned   I WILL speak to her  No power on earth should stop me  while I was standing here! Have I been silent all these years  and shall I not speak now  I loved him better than you ever loved him!  turning on her fiercely   I could have loved him  and asked no return  If I had been his wife  I could have been the slave of his caprices for a word of love a year  I should have been  Who knows it better than I  You were exacting  proud  punctilious  selfish  My love would have been devoted--would have trod your paltry whimpering under foot!   With flashing eyes  she stamped upon the ground as if she actually did it    Look here!  she said  striking the scar again  with a relentless hand   When he grew into the better understanding of what he had done  he saw it  and repented of it! I could sing to him  and talk to him  and show the ardour that I felt in all he did  and attain with labour to such knowledge as most interested him; and I attracted him  When he was freshest and truest  he loved me  Yes  he did! Many a time  when you were put off with a slight word  he has taken Me to his heart!   She said it with a taunting pride in the midst of her frenzy--for it was little less--yet with an eager remembrance of it  in which the smouldering embers of a gentler feeling kindled for the moment    I descended--as I might have known I should  but that he fascinated me with his boyish courtship--into a doll  a trifle for the occupation of an idle hour  to be dropped  and taken up  and trifled with  as the inconstant humour took him  When he grew weary  I grew weary  As his fancy died out  I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I had  than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for his wife  We fell away from one another without a word  Perhaps you saw it  and were not sorry  Since then  I have been a mere disfigured piece of furniture between you both; having no eyes  no ears  no feelings  no remembrances  Moan  Moan for what you made him; not for your love  I tell you that the time was  when I loved him better than you ever did!   She stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare  and the set face; and softened no more  when the moaning was repeated  than if the face had been a picture    Miss Dartle   said I   if you can be so obdurate as not to feel for this afflicted mother--    Who feels for me   she sharply retorted   She has sown this  Let her moan for the harvest that she reaps today!    And if his faults--  I began    Faults!  she cried  bursting into passionate tears   Who dares malign him  He had a soul worth millions of the friends to whom he stooped!    No one can have loved him better  no one can hold him in dearer remembrance than I   I replied   I meant to say  if you have no compassion for his mother; or if his faults--you have been bitter on them--    It s false   she cried  tearing her black hair;  I loved him!    --if his faults cannot   I went on   be banished from your remembrance  in such an hour; look at that figure  even as one you have never seen before  and render it some help!   All this time  the figure was unchanged  and looked unchangeable  Motionless  rigid  staring; moaning in the same dumb way from time to time  with the same helpless motion of the head; but giving no other sign of life  Miss Dartle suddenly kneeled down before it  and began to loosen the dress    A curse upon you!  she said  looking round at me  with a mingled expression of rage and grief   It was in an evil hour that you ever came here! A curse upon you! Go!   After passing out of the room  I hurried back to ring the bell  the sooner to alarm the servants  She had then taken the impassive figure in her arms  and  still upon her knees  was weeping over it  kissing it  calling to it  rocking it to and fro upon her bosom like a child  and trying every tender means to rouse the dormant senses  No longer afraid of leaving her  I noiselessly turned back again; and alarmed the house as I went out   Later in the day  I returned  and we laid him in his mother s room  She was just the same  they told me; Miss Dartle never left her; doctors were in attendance  many things had been tried; but she lay like a statue  except for the low sound now and then   I went through the dreary house  and darkened the windows  The windows of the chamber where he lay  I darkened last  I lifted up the leaden hand  and held it to my heart; and all the world seemed death and silence  broken only by his mother s moaning     CHAPTER 57  THE EMIGRANTS   One thing more  I had to do  before yielding myself to the shock of these emotions  It was  to conceal what had occurred  from those who were going away; and to dismiss them on their voyage in happy ignorance  In this  no time was to be lost   I took Mr  Micawber aside that same night  and confided to him the task of standing between Mr  Peggotty and intelligence of the late catastrophe  He zealously undertook to do so  and to intercept any newspaper through which it might  without such precautions  reach him    If it penetrates to him  sir   said Mr  Micawber  striking himself on the breast   it shall first pass through this body!   Mr  Micawber  I must observe  in his adaptation of himself to a new state of society  had acquired a bold buccaneering air  not absolutely lawless  but defensive and prompt  One might have supposed him a child of the wilderness  long accustomed to live out of the confines of civilization  and about to return to his native wilds   He had provided himself  among other things  with a complete suit of oilskin  and a straw hat with a very low crown  pitched or caulked on the outside  In this rough clothing  with a common mariner s telescope under his arm  and a shrewd trick of casting up his eye at the sky as looking out for dirty weather  he was far more nautical  after his manner  than Mr  Peggotty  His whole family  if I may so express it  were cleared for action  I found Mrs  Micawber in the closest and most uncompromising of bonnets  made fast under the chin; and in a shawl which tied her up  as I had been tied up  when my aunt first received me  like a bundle  and was secured behind at the waist  in a strong knot  Miss Micawber I found made snug for stormy weather  in the same manner; with nothing superfluous about her  Master Micawber was hardly visible in a Guernsey shirt  and the shaggiest suit of slops I ever saw; and the children were done up  like preserved meats  in impervious cases  Both Mr  Micawber and his eldest son wore their sleeves loosely turned back at the wrists  as being ready to lend a hand in any direction  and to  tumble up   or sing out   Yeo--Heave--Yeo!  on the shortest notice   Thus Traddles and I found them at nightfall  assembled on the wooden steps  at that time known as Hungerford Stairs  watching the departure of a boat with some of their property on board  I had told Traddles of the terrible event  and it had greatly shocked him; but there could be no doubt of the kindness of keeping it a secret  and he had come to help me in this last service  It was here that I took Mr  Micawber aside  and received his promise   The Micawber family were lodged in a little  dirty  tumble-down public-house  which in those days was close to the stairs  and whose protruding wooden rooms overhung the river  The family  as emigrants  being objects of some interest in and about Hungerford  attracted so many beholders  that we were glad to take refuge in their room  It was one of the wooden chambers upstairs  with the tide flowing underneath  My aunt and Agnes were there  busily making some little extra comforts  in the way of dress  for the children  Peggotty was quietly assisting  with the old insensible work-box  yard-measure  and bit of wax-candle before her  that had now outlived so much   It was not easy to answer her inquiries; still less to whisper Mr  Peggotty  when Mr  Micawber brought him in  that I had given the letter  and all was well  But I did both  and made them happy  If I showed any trace of what I felt  my own sorrows were sufficient to account for it    And when does the ship sail  Mr  Micawber   asked my aunt   Mr  Micawber considered it necessary to prepare either my aunt or his wife  by degrees  and said  sooner than he had expected yesterday    The boat brought you word  I suppose   said my aunt    It did  ma am   he returned    Well   said my aunt   And she sails--    Madam   he replied   I am informed that we must positively be on board before seven tomorrow morning     Heyday!  said my aunt   that s soon  Is it a sea-going fact  Mr  Peggotty     Tis so  ma am  She ll drop down the river with that theer tide  If Mas r Davy and my sister comes aboard at Gravesen   arternoon o  next day  they ll see the last on us     And that we shall do   said I   be sure!    Until then  and until we are at sea   observed Mr  Micawber  with a glance of intelligence at me   Mr  Peggotty and myself will constantly keep a double look-out together  on our goods and chattels  Emma  my love   said Mr  Micawber  clearing his throat in his magnificent way   my friend Mr  Thomas Traddles is so obliging as to solicit  in my ear  that he should have the privilege of ordering the ingredients necessary to the composition of a moderate portion of that Beverage which is peculiarly associated  in our minds  with the Roast Beef of Old England  I allude to--in short  Punch  Under ordinary circumstances  I should scruple to entreat the indulgence of Miss Trotwood and Miss Wickfield  but-    I can only say for myself   said my aunt   that I will drink all happiness and success to you  Mr  Micawber  with the utmost pleasure     And I too!  said Agnes  with a smile   Mr  Micawber immediately descended to the bar  where he appeared to be quite at home; and in due time returned with a steaming jug  I could not but observe that he had been peeling the lemons with his own clasp-knife  which  as became the knife of a practical settler  was about a foot long; and which he wiped  not wholly without ostentation  on the sleeve of his coat  Mrs  Micawber and the two elder members of the family I now found to be provided with similar formidable instruments  while every child had its own wooden spoon attached to its body by a strong line  In a similar anticipation of life afloat  and in the Bush  Mr  Micawber  instead of helping Mrs  Micawber and his eldest son and daughter to punch  in wine-glasses  which he might easily have done  for there was a shelf-full in the room  served it out to them in a series of villainous little tin pots; and I never saw him enjoy anything so much as drinking out of his own particular pint pot  and putting it in his pocket at the close of the evening    The luxuries of the old country   said Mr  Micawber  with an intense satisfaction in their renouncement   we abandon  The denizens of the forest cannot  of course  expect to participate in the refinements of the land of the Free    Here  a boy came in to say that Mr  Micawber was wanted downstairs    I have a presentiment   said Mrs  Micawber  setting down her tin pot   that it is a member of my family!    If so  my dear   observed Mr  Micawber  with his usual suddenness of warmth on that subject   as the member of your family--whoever he  she  or it  may be--has kept us waiting for a considerable period  perhaps the Member may now wait MY convenience     Micawber   said his wife  in a low tone   at such a time as this--      said Mr  Micawber  rising   
  The loss  Micawber   observed his wife   has been my family s  not yours  If my family are at length sensible of the deprivation to which their own conduct has  in the past  exposed them  and now desire to extend the hand of fellowship  let it not be repulsed     My dear   he returned   so be it!    If not for their sakes; for mine  Micawber   said his wife    Emma   he returned   that view of the question is  at such a moment  irresistible  I cannot  even now  distinctly pledge myself to fall upon your family s neck; but the member of your family  who is now in attendance  shall have no genial warmth frozen by me    Mr  Micawber withdrew  and was absent some little time; in the course of which Mrs  Micawber was not wholly free from an apprehension that words might have arisen between him and the Member  At length the same boy reappeared  and presented me with a note written in pencil  and headed  in a legal manner   Heep v  Micawber   From this document  I learned that Mr  Micawber being again arrested   Was in a final paroxysm of despair; and that he begged me to send him his knife and pint pot  by bearer  as they might prove serviceable during the brief remainder of his existence  in jail  He also requested  as a last act of friendship  that I would see his family to the Parish Workhouse  and forget that such a Being ever lived   Of course I answered this note by going down with the boy to pay the money  where I found Mr  Micawber sitting in a corner  looking darkly at the Sheriff  s Officer who had effected the capture  On his release  he embraced me with the utmost fervour; and made an entry of the transaction in his pocket-book--being very particular  I recollect  about a halfpenny I inadvertently omitted from my statement of the total   This momentous pocket-book was a timely reminder to him of another transaction  On our return to the room upstairs  where he accounted for his absence by saying that it had been occasioned by circumstances over which he had no control   he took out of it a large sheet of paper  folded small  and quite covered with long sums  carefully worked  From the glimpse I had of them  I should say that I never saw such sums out of a school ciphering-book  These  it seemed  were calculations of compound interest on what he called  the principal amount of forty-one  ten  eleven and a half   for various periods  After a careful consideration of these  and an elaborate estimate of his resources  he had come to the conclusion to select that sum which represented the amount with compound interest to two years  fifteen calendar months  and fourteen days  from that date  For this he had drawn a note-of-hand with great neatness  which he handed over to Traddles on the spot  a discharge of his debt in full  as between man and man   with many acknowledgements    I have still a presentiment   said Mrs  Micawber  pensively shaking her head   that my family will appear on board  before we finally depart    Mr  Micawber evidently had his presentiment on the subject too  but he put it in his tin pot and swallowed it    If you have any opportunity of sending letters home  on your passage  Mrs  Micawber   said my aunt   you must let us hear from you  you know     My dear Miss Trotwood   she replied   I shall only be too happy to think that anyone expects to hear from us  I shall not fail to correspond  Mr  Copperfield  I trust  as an old and familiar friend  will not object to receive occasional intelligence  himself  from one who knew him when the twins were yet unconscious    I said that I should hope to hear  whenever she had an opportunity of writing    Please Heaven  there will be many such opportunities   said Mr  Micawber   The ocean  in these times  is a perfect fleet of ships; and we can hardly fail to encounter many  in running over  It is merely crossing   said Mr  Micawber  trifling with his eye-glass   merely crossing  The distance is quite imaginary    I think  now  how odd it was  but how wonderfully like Mr  Micawber  that  when he went from London to Canterbury  he should have talked as if he were going to the farthest limits of the earth; and  when he went from England to Australia  as if he were going for a little trip across the channel    On the voyage  I shall endeavour   said Mr  Micawber   occasionally to spin them a yarn; and the melody of my son Wilkins will  I trust  be acceptable at the galley-fire  When Mrs  Micawber has her sea-legs on--an expression in which I hope there is no conventional impropriety--she will give them  I dare say  and dolphins  I believe  will be frequently observed athwart our Bows; and  either on the starboard or the larboard quarter  objects of interest will be continually descried  In short   said Mr  Micawber  with the old genteel air   the probability is  all will be found so exciting  alow and aloft  that when the lookout  stationed in the main-top  cries Land-oh! we shall be very considerably astonished!   With that he flourished off the contents of his little tin pot  as if he had made the voyage  and had passed a first-class examination before the highest naval authorities    What I chiefly hope  my dear Mr  Copperfield   said Mrs  Micawber   is  that in some branches of our family we may live again in the old country  Do not frown  Micawber! I do not now refer to my own family  but to our children s children  However vigorous the sapling   said Mrs  Micawber  shaking her head   I cannot forget the parent-tree; and when our race attains to eminence and fortune  I own I should wish that fortune to flow into the coffers of Britannia     My dear   said Mr  Micawber   Britannia must take her chance  I am bound to say that she has never done much for me  and that I have no particular wish upon the subject     Micawber   returned Mrs  Micawber   there  you are wrong  You are going out  Micawber  to this distant clime  to strengthen  not to weaken  the connexion between yourself and Albion     The connexion in question  my love   rejoined Mr  Micawber   has not laid me  I repeat  under that load of personal obligation  that I am at all sensitive as to the formation of another connexion     Micawber   returned Mrs  Micawber   There  I again say  you are wrong  You do not know your power  Micawber  It is that which will strengthen  even in this step you are about to take  the connexion between yourself and Albion    Mr  Micawber sat in his elbow-chair  with his eyebrows raised; half receiving and half repudiating Mrs  Micawber s views as they were stated  but very sensible of their foresight    My dear Mr  Copperfield   said Mrs  Micawber   I wish Mr  Micawber to feel his position  It appears to me highly important that Mr  Micawber should  from the hour of his embarkation  feel his position  Your old knowledge of me  my dear Mr  Copperfield  will have told you that I have not the sanguine disposition of Mr  Micawber  My disposition is  if I may say so  eminently practical  I know that this is a long voyage  I know that it will involve many privations and inconveniences  I cannot shut my eyes to those facts  But I also know what Mr  Micawber is  I know the latent power of Mr  Micawber  And therefore I consider it vitally important that Mr  Micawber should feel his position     My love   he observed   perhaps you will allow me to remark that it is barely possible that I DO feel my position at the present moment     I think not  Micawber   she rejoined   Not fully  My dear Mr  Copperfield  Mr  Micawber s is not a common case  Mr  Micawber is going to a distant country expressly in order that he may be fully understood and appreciated for the first time  I wish Mr  Micawber to take his stand upon that vessel s prow  and firmly say   Mr  Micawber  glancing at us all  seemed to think there was a good deal in this idea    I wish Mr  Micawber  if I make myself understood   said Mrs  Micawber  in her argumentative tone   to be the Caesar of his own fortunes  That  my dear Mr  Copperfield  appears to me to be his true position  From the first moment of this voyage  I wish Mr  Micawber to stand upon that vessel s prow and say   Mr  Micawber folded his arms in a resolute manner  as if he were then stationed on the figure-head    And doing that   said Mrs  Micawber   --feeling his position--am I not right in saying that Mr  Micawber will strengthen  and not weaken  his connexion with Britain  An important public character arising in that hemisphere  shall I be told that its influence will not be felt at home  Can I be so weak as to imagine that Mr  Micawber  wielding the rod of talent and of power in Australia  will be nothing in England  I am but a woman; but I should be unworthy of myself and of my papa  if I were guilty of such absurd weakness    Mrs  Micawber s conviction that her arguments were unanswerable  gave a moral elevation to her tone which I think I had never heard in it before    And therefore it is   said Mrs  Micawber   that I the more wish  that  at a future period  we may live again on the parent soil  Mr  Micawber may be--I cannot disguise from myself that the probability is  Mr  Micawber will be--a page of History; and he ought then to be represented in the country which gave him birth  and did NOT give him employment!    My love   observed Mr  Micawber   it is impossible for me not to be touched by your affection  I am always willing to defer to your good sense  What will be--will be  Heaven forbid that I should grudge my native country any portion of the wealth that may be accumulated by our descendants!    That s well   said my aunt  nodding towards Mr  Peggotty   and I drink my love to you all  and every blessing and success attend you!   Mr  Peggotty put down the two children he had been nursing  one on each knee  to join Mr  and Mrs  Micawber in drinking to all of us in return; and when he and the Micawbers cordially shook hands as comrades  and his brown face brightened with a smile  I felt that he would make his way  establish a good name  and be beloved  go where he would   Even the children were instructed  each to dip a wooden spoon into Mr  Micawber s pot  and pledge us in its contents  When this was done  my aunt and Agnes rose  and parted from the emigrants  It was a sorrowful farewell  They were all crying; the children hung about Agnes to the last; and we left poor Mrs  Micawber in a very distressed condition  sobbing and weeping by a dim candle  that must have made the room look  from the river  like a miserable light-house   I went down again next morning to see that they were away  They had departed  in a boat  as early as five o clock  It was a wonderful instance to me of the gap such partings make  that although my association of them with the tumble-down public-house and the wooden stairs dated only from last night  both seemed dreary and deserted  now that they were gone   In the afternoon of the next day  my old nurse and I went down to Gravesend  We found the ship in the river  surrounded by a crowd of boats; a favourable wind blowing; the signal for sailing at her mast-head  I hired a boat directly  and we put off to her; and getting through the little vortex of confusion of which she was the centre  went on board   Mr  Peggotty was waiting for us on deck  He told me that Mr  Micawber had just now been arrested again  and for the last time  at the suit of Heep  and that  in compliance with a request I had made to him  he had paid the money  which I repaid him  He then took us down between decks; and there  any lingering fears I had of his having heard any rumours of what had happened  were dispelled by Mr  Micawber s coming out of the gloom  taking his arm with an air of friendship and protection  and telling me that they had scarcely been asunder for a moment  since the night before last   It was such a strange scene to me  and so confined and dark  that  at first  I could make out hardly anything; but  by degrees  it cleared  as my eyes became more accustomed to the gloom  and I seemed to stand in a picture by OSTADE  Among the great beams  bulks  and ringbolts of the ship  and the emigrant-berths  and chests  and bundles  and barrels  and heaps of miscellaneous baggage-- lighted up  here and there  by dangling lanterns; and elsewhere by the yellow daylight straying down a windsail or a hatchway--were crowded groups of people  making new friendships  taking leave of one another  talking  laughing  crying  eating and drinking; some  already settled down into the possession of their few feet of space  with their little households arranged  and tiny children established on stools  or in dwarf elbow-chairs; others  despairing of a resting-place  and wandering disconsolately  From babies who had but a week or two of life behind them  to crooked old men and women who seemed to have but a week or two of life before them; and from ploughmen bodily carrying out soil of England on their boots  to smiths taking away samples of its soot and smoke upon their skins; every age and occupation appeared to be crammed into the narrow compass of the  tween decks   As my eye glanced round this place  I thought I saw sitting  by an open port  with one of the Micawber children near her  a figure like Emily s; it first attracted my attention  by another figure parting from it with a kiss; and as it glided calmly away through the disorder  reminding me of--Agnes! But in the rapid motion and confusion  and in the unsettlement of my own thoughts  I lost it again; and only knew that the time was come when all visitors were being warned to leave the ship; that my nurse was crying on a chest beside me; and that Mrs  Gummidge  assisted by some younger stooping woman in black  was busily arranging Mr  Peggotty s goods    Is there any last wured  Mas r Davy   said he   Is there any one forgotten thing afore we parts     One thing!  said I   Martha!   He touched the younger woman I have mentioned on the shoulder  and Martha stood before me    Heaven bless you  you good man!  cried I   You take her with you!   She answered for him  with a burst of tears  I could speak no more at that time  but I wrung his hand; and if ever I have loved and honoured any man  I loved and honoured that man in my soul   The ship was clearing fast of strangers  The greatest trial that I had  remained  I told him what the noble spirit that was gone  had given me in charge to say at parting  It moved him deeply  But when he charged me  in return  with many messages of affection and regret for those deaf ears  he moved me more   The time was come  I embraced him  took my weeping nurse upon my arm  and hurried away  On deck  I took leave of poor Mrs  Micawber  She was looking distractedly about for her family  even then; and her last words to me were  that she never would desert Mr  Micawber   We went over the side into our boat  and lay at a little distance  to see the ship wafted on her course  It was then calm  radiant sunset  She lay between us  and the red light; and every taper line and spar was visible against the glow  A sight at once so beautiful  so mournful  and so hopeful  as the glorious ship  lying  still  on the flushed water  with all the life on board her crowded at the bulwarks  and there clustering  for a moment  bare-headed and silent  I never saw   Silent  only for a moment  As the sails rose to the wind  and the ship began to move  there broke from all the boats three resounding cheers  which those on board took up  and echoed back  and which were echoed and re-echoed  My heart burst out when I heard the sound  and beheld the waving of the hats and handkerchiefs--and then I saw her!  Then I saw her  at her uncle s side  and trembling on his shoulder  He pointed to us with an eager hand; and she saw us  and waved her last good-bye to me  Aye  Emily  beautiful and drooping  cling to him with the utmost trust of thy bruised heart; for he has clung to thee  with all the might of his great love!  Surrounded by the rosy light  and standing high upon the deck  apart together  she clinging to him  and he holding her  they solemnly passed away  The night had fallen on the Kentish hills when we were rowed ashore--and fallen darkly upon me     CHAPTER 58  ABSENCE   It was a long and gloomy night that gathered on me  haunted by the ghosts of many hopes  of many dear remembrances  many errors  many unavailing sorrows and regrets   I went away from England; not knowing  even then  how great the shock was  that I had to bear  I left all who were dear to me  and went away; and believed that I had borne it  and it was past  As a man upon a field of battle will receive a mortal hurt  and scarcely know that he is struck  so I  when I was left alone with my undisciplined heart  had no conception of the wound with which it had to strive   The knowledge came upon me  not quickly  but little by little  and grain by grain  The desolate feeling with which I went abroad  deepened and widened hourly  At first it was a heavy sense of loss and sorrow  wherein I could distinguish little else  By imperceptible degrees  it became a hopeless consciousness of all that I had lost--love  friendship  interest; of all that had been shattered--my first trust  my first affection  the whole airy castle of my life; of all that remained--a ruined blank and waste  lying wide around me  unbroken  to the dark horizon   If my grief were selfish  I did not know it to be so  I mourned for my child-wife  taken from her blooming world  so young  I mourned for him who might have won the love and admiration of thousands  as he had won mine long ago  I mourned for the broken heart that had found rest in the stormy sea; and for the wandering remnants of the simple home  where I had heard the night-wind blowing  when I was a child   From the accumulated sadness into which I fell  I had at length no hope of ever issuing again  I roamed from place to place  carrying my burden with me everywhere  I felt its whole weight now; and I drooped beneath it  and I said in my heart that it could never be lightened   When this despondency was at its worst  I believed that I should die  Sometimes  I thought that I would like to die at home; and actually turned back on my road  that I might get there soon  At other times  I passed on farther away --from city to city  seeking I know not what  and trying to leave I know not what behind   It is not in my power to retrace  one by one  all the weary phases of distress of mind through which I passed  There are some dreams that can only be imperfectly and vaguely described; and when I oblige myself to look back on this time of my life  I seem to be recalling such a dream  I see myself passing on among the novelties of foreign towns  palaces  cathedrals  temples  pictures  castles  tombs  fantastic streets--the old abiding places of History and Fancy--as a dreamer might; bearing my painful load through all  and hardly conscious of the objects as they fade before me  Listlessness to everything  but brooding sorrow  was the night that fell on my undisciplined heart  Let me look up from it--as at last I did  thank Heaven!--and from its long  sad  wretched dream  to dawn   For many months I travelled with this ever-darkening cloud upon my mind  Some blind reasons that I had for not returning home--reasons then struggling within me  vainly  for more distinct expression--kept me on my pilgrimage  Sometimes  I had proceeded restlessly from place to place  stopping nowhere; sometimes  I had lingered long in one spot  I had had no purpose  no sustaining soul within me  anywhere   I was in Switzerland  I had come out of Italy  over one of the great passes of the Alps  and had since wandered with a guide among the by-ways of the mountains  If those awful solitudes had spoken to my heart  I did not know it  I had found sublimity and wonder in the dread heights and precipices  in the roaring torrents  and the wastes of ice and snow; but as yet  they had taught me nothing else   I came  one evening before sunset  down into a valley  where I was to rest  In the course of my descent to it  by the winding track along the mountain-side  from which I saw it shining far below  I think some long-unwonted sense of beauty and tranquillity  some softening influence awakened by its peace  moved faintly in my breast  I remember pausing once  with a kind of sorrow that was not all oppressive  not quite despairing  I remember almost hoping that some better change was possible within me   I came into the valley  as the evening sun was shining on the remote heights of snow  that closed it in  like eternal clouds  The bases of the mountains forming the gorge in which the little village lay  were richly green; and high above this gentler vegetation  grew forests of dark fir  cleaving the wintry snow-drift  wedge-like  and stemming the avalanche  Above these  were range upon range of craggy steeps  grey rock  bright ice  and smooth verdure-specks of pasture  all gradually blending with the crowning snow  Dotted here and there on the mountain s-side  each tiny dot a home  were lonely wooden cottages  so dwarfed by the towering heights that they appeared too small for toys  So did even the clustered village in the valley  with its wooden bridge across the stream  where the stream tumbled over broken rocks  and roared away among the trees  In the quiet air  there was a sound of distant singing--shepherd voices; but  as one bright evening cloud floated midway along the mountain s-side  I could almost have believed it came from there  and was not earthly music  All at once  in this serenity  great Nature spoke to me; and soothed me to lay down my weary head upon the grass  and weep as I had not wept yet  since Dora died!  I had found a packet of letters awaiting me but a few minutes before  and had strolled out of the village to read them while my supper was making ready  Other packets had missed me  and I had received none for a long time  Beyond a line or two  to say that I was well  and had arrived at such a place  I had not had fortitude or constancy to write a letter since I left home   The packet was in my hand  I opened it  and read the writing of Agnes   She was happy and useful  was prospering as she had hoped  That was all she told me of herself  The rest referred to me   She gave me no advice; she urged no duty on me; she only told me  in her own fervent manner  what her trust in me was  She knew  she said  how such a nature as mine would turn affliction to good  She knew how trial and emotion would exalt and strengthen it  She was sure that in my every purpose I should gain a firmer and a higher tendency  through the grief I had undergone  She  who so gloried in my fame  and so looked forward to its augmentation  well knew that I would labour on  She knew that in me  sorrow could not be weakness  but must be strength  As the endurance of my childish days had done its part to make me what I was  so greater calamities would nerve me on  to be yet better than I was; and so  as they had taught me  would I teach others  She commended me to God  who had taken my innocent darling to His rest; and in her sisterly affection cherished me always  and was always at my side go where I would; proud of what I had done  but infinitely prouder yet of what I was reserved to do   I put the letter in my breast  and thought what had I been an hour ago! When I heard the voices die away  and saw the quiet evening cloud grow dim  and all the colours in the valley fade  and the golden snow upon the mountain-tops become a remote part of the pale night sky  yet felt that the night was passing from my mind  and all its shadows clearing  there was no name for the love I bore her  dearer to me  henceforward  than ever until then   I read her letter many times  I wrote to her before I slept  I told her that I had been in sore need of her help; that without her I was not  and I never had been  what she thought me; but that she inspired me to be that  and I would try   I did try  In three months more  a year would have passed since the beginning of my sorrow  I determined to make no resolutions until the expiration of those three months  but to try  I lived in that valley  and its neighbourhood  all the time   The three months gone  I resolved to remain away from home for some time longer; to settle myself for the present in Switzerland  which was growing dear to me in the remembrance of that evening; to resume my pen; to work   I resorted humbly whither Agnes had commended me; I sought out Nature  never sought in vain; and I admitted to my breast the human interest I had lately shrunk from  It was not long  before I had almost as many friends in the valley as in Yarmouth: and when I left it  before the winter set in  for Geneva  and came back in the spring  their cordial greetings had a homely sound to me  although they were not conveyed in English words   I worked early and late  patiently and hard  I wrote a Story  with a purpose growing  not remotely  out of my experience  and sent it to Traddles  and he arranged for its publication very advantageously for me; and the tidings of my growing reputation began to reach me from travellers whom I encountered by chance  After some rest and change  I fell to work  in my old ardent way  on a new fancy  which took strong possession of me  As I advanced in the execution of this task  I felt it more and more  and roused my utmost energies to do it well  This was my third work of fiction  It was not half written  when  in an interval of rest  I thought of returning home   For a long time  though studying and working patiently  I had accustomed myself to robust exercise  My health  severely impaired when I left England  was quite restored  I had seen much  I had been in many countries  and I hope I had improved my store of knowledge   I have now recalled all that I think it needful to recall here  of this term of absence--with one reservation  I have made it  thus far  with no purpose of suppressing any of my thoughts; for  as I have elsewhere said  this narrative is my written memory  I have desired to keep the most secret current of my mind apart  and to the last  I enter on it now  I cannot so completely penetrate the mystery of my own heart  as to know when I began to think that I might have set its earliest and brightest hopes on Agnes  I cannot say at what stage of my grief it first became associated with the reflection  that  in my wayward boyhood  I had thrown away the treasure of her love  I believe I may have heard some whisper of that distant thought  in the old unhappy loss or want of something never to be realized  of which I had been sensible  But the thought came into my mind as a new reproach and new regret  when I was left so sad and lonely in the world   If  at that time  I had been much with her  I should  in the weakness of my desolation  have betrayed this  It was what I remotely dreaded when I was first impelled to stay away from England  I could not have borne to lose the smallest portion of her sisterly affection; yet  in that betrayal  I should have set a constraint between us hitherto unknown   I could not forget that the feeling with which she now regarded me had grown up in my own free choice and course  That if she had ever loved me with another love--and I sometimes thought the time was when she might have done so--I had cast it away  It was nothing  now  that I had accustomed myself to think of her  when we were both mere children  as one who was far removed from my wild fancies  I had bestowed my passionate tenderness upon another object; and what I might have done  I had not done; and what Agnes was to me  I and her own noble heart had made her   In the beginning of the change that gradually worked in me  when I tried to get a better understanding of myself and be a better man  I did glance  through some indefinite probation  to a period when I might possibly hope to cancel the mistaken past  and to be so blessed as to marry her  But  as time wore on  this shadowy prospect faded  and departed from me  If she had ever loved me  then  I should hold her the more sacred; remembering the confidences I had reposed in her  her knowledge of my errant heart  the sacrifice she must have made to be my friend and sister  and the victory she had won  If she had never loved me  could I believe that she would love me now   I had always felt my weakness  in comparison with her constancy and fortitude; and now I felt it more and more  Whatever I might have been to her  or she to me  if I had been more worthy of her long ago  I was not now  and she was not  The time was past  I had let it go by  and had deservedly lost her   That I suffered much in these contentions  that they filled me with unhappiness and remorse  and yet that I had a sustaining sense that it was required of me  in right and honour  to keep away from myself  with shame  the thought of turning to the dear girl in the withering of my hopes  from whom I had frivolously turned when they were bright and fresh--which consideration was at the root of every thought I had concerning her--is all equally true  I made no effort to conceal from myself  now  that I loved her  that I was devoted to her; but I brought the assurance home to myself  that it was now too late  and that our long-subsisting relation must be undisturbed   I had thought  much and often  of my Dora s shadowing out to me what might have happened  in those years that were destined not to try us; I had considered how the things that never happen  are often as much realities to us  in their effects  as those that are accomplished  The very years she spoke of  were realities now  for my correction; and would have been  one day  a little later perhaps  though we had parted in our earliest folly  I endeavoured to convert what might have been between myself and Agnes  into a means of making me more self-denying  more resolved  more conscious of myself  and my defects and errors  Thus  through the reflection that it might have been  I arrived at the conviction that it could never be   These  with their perplexities and inconsistencies  were the shifting quicksands of my mind  from the time of my departure to the time of my return home  three years afterwards  Three years had elapsed since the sailing of the emigrant ship; when  at that same hour of sunset  and in the same place  I stood on the deck of the packet vessel that brought me home  looking on the rosy water where I had seen the image of that ship reflected   Three years  Long in the aggregate  though short as they went by  And home was very dear to me  and Agnes too--but she was not mine--she was never to be mine  She might have been  but that was past!    CHAPTER 59  RETURN   I landed in London on a wintry autumn evening  It was dark and raining  and I saw more fog and mud in a minute than I had seen in a year  I walked from the Custom House to the Monument before I found a coach; and although the very house-fronts  looking on the swollen gutters  were like old friends to me  I could not but admit that they were very dingy friends   I have often remarked--I suppose everybody has--that one s going away from a familiar place  would seem to be the signal for change in it  As I looked out of the coach window  and observed that an old house on Fish-street Hill  which had stood untouched by painter  carpenter  or bricklayer  for a century  had been pulled down in my absence; and that a neighbouring street  of time-honoured insalubrity and inconvenience  was being drained and widened; I half expected to find St  Paul s Cathedral looking older   For some changes in the fortunes of my friends  I was prepared  My aunt had long been re-established at Dover  and Traddles had begun to get into some little practice at the Bar  in the very first term after my departure  He had chambers in Gray s Inn  now; and had told me  in his last letters  that he was not without hopes of being soon united to the dearest girl in the world   They expected me home before Christmas; but had no idea of my returning so soon  I had purposely misled them  that I might have the pleasure of taking them by surprise  And yet  I was perverse enough to feel a chill and disappointment in receiving no welcome  and rattling  alone and silent  through the misty streets   The well-known shops  however  with their cheerful lights  did something for me; and when I alighted at the door of the Gray s Inn Coffee-house  I had recovered my spirits  It recalled  at first  that so-different time when I had put up at the Golden Cross  and reminded me of the changes that had come to pass since then; but that was natural    Do you know where Mr  Traddles lives in the Inn   I asked the waiter  as I warmed myself by the coffee-room fire    Holborn Court  sir  Number two     Mr  Traddles has a rising reputation among the lawyers  I believe   said I    Well  sir   returned the waiter   probably he has  sir; but I am not aware of it myself    This waiter  who was middle-aged and spare  looked for help to a waiter of more authority--a stout  potential old man  with a double chin  in black breeches and stockings  who came out of a place like a churchwarden s pew  at the end of the coffee-room  where he kept company with a cash-box  a Directory  a Law-list  and other books and papers    Mr  Traddles   said the spare waiter   Number two in the Court    The potential waiter waved him away  and turned  gravely  to me    I was inquiring   said I   whether Mr  Traddles  at number two in the Court  has not a rising reputation among the lawyers     Never heard his name   said the waiter  in a rich husky voice   I felt quite apologetic for Traddles    He s a young man  sure   said the portentous waiter  fixing his eyes severely on me   How long has he been in the Inn     Not above three years   said I   The waiter  who I supposed had lived in his churchwarden s pew for forty years  could not pursue such an insignificant subject  He asked me what I would have for dinner   I felt I was in England again  and really was quite cast down on Traddles s account  There seemed to be no hope for him  I meekly ordered a bit of fish and a steak  and stood before the fire musing on his obscurity   As I followed the chief waiter with my eyes  I could not help thinking that the garden in which he had gradually blown to be the flower he was  was an arduous place to rise in  It had such a prescriptive  stiff-necked  long-established  solemn  elderly air  I glanced about the room  which had had its sanded floor sanded  no doubt  in exactly the same manner when the chief waiter was a boy--if he ever was a boy  which appeared improbable; and at the shining tables  where I saw myself reflected  in unruffled depths of old mahogany; and at the lamps  without a flaw in their trimming or cleaning; and at the comfortable green curtains  with their pure brass rods  snugly enclosing the boxes; and at the two large coal fires  brightly burning; and at the rows of decanters  burly as if with the consciousness of pipes of expensive old port wine below; and both England  and the law  appeared to me to be very difficult indeed to be taken by storm  I went up to my bedroom to change my wet clothes; and the vast extent of that old wainscoted apartment  which was over the archway leading to the Inn  I remember   and the sedate immensity of the four-post bedstead  and the indomitable gravity of the chests of drawers  all seemed to unite in sternly frowning on the fortunes of Traddles  or on any such daring youth  I came down again to my dinner; and even the slow comfort of the meal  and the orderly silence of the place--which was bare of guests  the Long Vacation not yet being over--were eloquent on the audacity of Traddles  and his small hopes of a livelihood for twenty years to come   I had seen nothing like this since I went away  and it quite dashed my hopes for my friend  The chief waiter had had enough of me  He came near me no more; but devoted himself to an old gentleman in long gaiters  to meet whom a pint of special port seemed to come out of the cellar of its own accord  for he gave no order  The second waiter informed me  in a whisper  that this old gentleman was a retired conveyancer living in the Square  and worth a mint of money  which it was expected he would leave to his laundress s daughter; likewise that it was rumoured that he had a service of plate in a bureau  all tarnished with lying by  though more than one spoon and a fork had never yet been beheld in his chambers by mortal vision  By this time  I quite gave Traddles up for lost; and settled in my own mind that there was no hope for him   Being very anxious to see the dear old fellow  nevertheless  I dispatched my dinner  in a manner not at all calculated to raise me in the opinion of the chief waiter  and hurried out by the back way  Number two in the Court was soon reached; and an inscription on the door-post informing me that Mr  Traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top storey  I ascended the staircase  A crazy old staircase I found it to be  feebly lighted on each landing by a club--headed little oil wick  dying away in a little dungeon of dirty glass   In the course of my stumbling upstairs  I fancied I heard a pleasant sound of laughter; and not the laughter of an attorney or barrister  or attorney s clerk or barrister s clerk  but of two or three merry girls  Happening  however  as I stopped to listen  to put my foot in a hole where the Honourable Society of Gray s Inn had left a plank deficient  I fell down with some noise  and when I recovered my footing all was silent   Groping my way more carefully  for the rest of the journey  my heart beat high when I found the outer door  which had Mr  TRADDLES painted on it  open  I knocked  A considerable scuffling within ensued  but nothing else  I therefore knocked again   A small sharp-looking lad  half-footboy and half-clerk  who was very much out of breath  but who looked at me as if he defied me to prove it legally  presented himself    Is Mr  Traddles within   I said    Yes  sir  but he s engaged     I want to see him    After a moment s survey of me  the sharp-looking lad decided to let me in; and opening the door wider for that purpose  admitted me  first  into a little closet of a hall  and next into a little sitting-room; where I came into the presence of my old friend  also out of breath   seated at a table  and bending over papers    Good God!  cried Traddles  looking up   It s Copperfield!  and rushed into my arms  where I held him tight    All well  my dear Traddles     All well  my dear  dear Copperfield  and nothing but good news!   We cried with pleasure  both of us    My dear fellow   said Traddles  rumpling his hair in his excitement  which was a most unnecessary operation   my dearest Copperfield  my long-lost and most welcome friend  how glad I am to see you! How brown you are! How glad I am! Upon my life and honour  I never was so rejoiced  my beloved Copperfield  never!   I was equally at a loss to express my emotions  I was quite unable to speak  at first    My dear fellow!  said Traddles   And grown so famous! My glorious Copperfield! Good gracious me  WHEN did you come  WHERE have you come from  WHAT have you been doing    Never pausing for an answer to anything he said  Traddles  who had clapped me into an easy-chair by the fire  all this time impetuously stirred the fire with one hand  and pulled at my neck-kerchief with the other  under some wild delusion that it was a great-coat  Without putting down the poker  he now hugged me again; and I hugged him; and  both laughing  and both wiping our eyes  we both sat down  and shook hands across the hearth    To think   said Traddles   that you should have been so nearly coming home as you must have been  my dear old boy  and not at the ceremony!    What ceremony  my dear Traddles     Good gracious me!  cried Traddles  opening his eyes in his old way   Didn t you get my last letter     Certainly not  if it referred to any ceremony     Why  my dear Copperfield   said Traddles  sticking his hair upright with both hands  and then putting his hands on my knees   I am married!    Married!  I cried joyfully    Lord bless me  yes!  said Traddles-- by the Reverend Horace--to Sophy--down in Devonshire  Why  my dear boy  she s behind the window curtain! Look here!   To my amazement  the dearest girl in the world came at that same instant  laughing and blushing  from her place of concealment  And a more cheerful  amiable  honest  happy  bright-looking bride  I believe  as I could not help saying on the spot  the world never saw  I kissed her as an old acquaintance should  and wished them joy with all my might of heart    Dear me   said Traddles   what a delightful re-union this is! You are so extremely brown  my dear Copperfield! God bless my soul  how happy I am!    And so am I   said I    And I am sure I am!  said the blushing and laughing Sophy    We are all as happy as possible!  said Traddles   Even the girls are happy  Dear me  I declare I forgot them!    Forgot   said I    The girls   said Traddles   Sophy s sisters  They are staying with us  They have come to have a peep at London  The fact is  when--was it you that tumbled upstairs  Copperfield     It was   said I  laughing    Well then  when you tumbled upstairs   said Traddles   I was romping with the girls  In point of fact  we were playing at Puss in the Corner  But as that wouldn t do in Westminster Hall  and as it wouldn t look quite professional if they were seen by a client  they decamped  And they are now--listening  I have no doubt   said Traddles  glancing at the door of another room    I am sorry   said I  laughing afresh   to have occasioned such a dispersion     Upon my word   rejoined Traddles  greatly delighted   if you had seen them running away  and running back again  after you had knocked  to pick up the combs they had dropped out of their hair  and going on in the maddest manner  you wouldn t have said so  My love  will you fetch the girls    Sophy tripped away  and we heard her received in the adjoining room with a peal of laughter    Really musical  isn t it  my dear Copperfield   said Traddles   It s very agreeable to hear  It quite lights up these old rooms  To an unfortunate bachelor of a fellow who has lived alone all his life  you know  it s positively delicious  It s charming  Poor things  they have had a great loss in Sophy--who  I do assure you  Copperfield is  and ever was  the dearest girl!--and it gratifies me beyond expression to find them in such good spirits  The society of girls is a very delightful thing  Copperfield  It s not professional  but it s very delightful    Observing that he slightly faltered  and comprehending that in the goodness of his heart he was fearful of giving me some pain by what he had said  I expressed my concurrence with a heartiness that evidently relieved and pleased him greatly    But then   said Traddles   our domestic arrangements are  to say the truth  quite unprofessional altogether  my dear Copperfield  Even Sophy s being here  is unprofessional  And we have no other place of abode  We have put to sea in a cockboat  but we are quite prepared to rough it  And Sophy s an extraordinary manager! You ll be surprised how those girls are stowed away  I am sure I hardly know how it s done!    Are many of the young ladies with you   I inquired    The eldest  the Beauty is here   said Traddles  in a low confidential voice   Caroline  And Sarah s here--the one I mentioned to you as having something the matter with her spine  you know  Immensely better! And the two youngest that Sophy educated are with us  And Louisa s here     Indeed!  cried I    Yes   said Traddles   Now the whole set--I mean the chambers--is only three rooms; but Sophy arranges for the girls in the most wonderful way  and they sleep as comfortably as possible  Three in that room   said Traddles  pointing   Two in that    I could not help glancing round  in search of the accommodation remaining for Mr  and Mrs  Traddles  Traddles understood me    Well!  said Traddles   we are prepared to rough it  as I said just now  and we did improvise a bed last week  upon the floor here  But there s a little room in the roof--a very nice room  when you re up there--which Sophy papered herself  to surprise me; and that s our room at present  It s a capital little gipsy sort of place  There s quite a view from it     And you are happily married at last  my dear Traddles!  said I   How rejoiced I am!    Thank you  my dear Copperfield   said Traddles  as we shook hands once more   Yes  I am as happy as it s possible to be  There s your old friend  you see   said Traddles  nodding triumphantly at the flower-pot and stand;  and there s the table with the marble top! All the other furniture is plain and serviceable  you perceive  And as to plate  Lord bless you  we haven t so much as a tea-spoon     All to be earned   said I  cheerfully    Exactly so   replied Traddles   all to be earned  Of course we have something in the shape of tea-spoons  because we stir our tea  But they re Britannia metal     The silver will be the brighter when it comes   said I    The very thing we say!  cried Traddles   You see  my dear Copperfield   falling again into the low confidential tone   after I had delivered my argument in DOE dem  JIPES versus WIGZIELL  which did me great service with the profession  I went down into Devonshire  and had some serious conversation in private with the Reverend Horace  I dwelt upon the fact that Sophy--who I do assure you  Copperfield  is the dearest girl!--    I am certain she is!  said I    She is  indeed!  rejoined Traddles   But I am afraid I am wandering from the subject  Did I mention the Reverend Horace     You said that you dwelt upon the fact--    True! Upon the fact that Sophy and I had been engaged for a long period  and that Sophy  with the permission of her parents  was more than content to take me--in short   said Traddles  with his old frank smile   on our present Britannia-metal footing  Very well  I then proposed to the Reverend Horace--who is a most excellent clergyman  Copperfield  and ought to be a Bishop; or at least ought to have enough to live upon  without pinching himself--that if I could turn the corner  say of two hundred and fifty pounds  in one year; and could see my way pretty clearly to that  or something better  next year; and could plainly furnish a little place like this  besides; then  and in that case  Sophy and I should be united  I took the liberty of representing that we had been patient for a good many years; and that the circumstance of Sophy s being extraordinarily useful at home  ought not to operate with her affectionate parents  against her establishment in life--don t you see     Certainly it ought not   said I    I am glad you think so  Copperfield   rejoined Traddles   because  without any imputation on the Reverend Horace  I do think parents  and brothers  and so forth  are sometimes rather selfish in such cases  Well! I also pointed out  that my most earnest desire was  to be useful to the family; and that if I got on in the world  and anything should happen to him--I refer to the Reverend Horace--    I understand   said I    --Or to Mrs  Crewler--it would be the utmost gratification of my wishes  to be a parent to the girls  He replied in a most admirable manner  exceedingly flattering to my feelings  and undertook to obtain the consent of Mrs  Crewler to this arrangement  They had a dreadful time of it with her  It mounted from her legs into her chest  and then into her head--    What mounted   I asked    Her grief   replied Traddles  with a serious look   Her feelings generally  As I mentioned on a former occasion  she is a very superior woman  but has lost the use of her limbs  Whatever occurs to harass her  usually settles in her legs; but on this occasion it mounted to the chest  and then to the head  and  in short  pervaded the whole system in a most alarming manner  However  they brought her through it by unremitting and affectionate attention; and we were married yesterday six weeks  You have no idea what a Monster I felt  Copperfield  when I saw the whole family crying and fainting away in every direction! Mrs  Crewler couldn t see me before we left--couldn t forgive me  then  for depriving her of her child--but she is a good creature  and has done so since  I had a delightful letter from her  only this morning     And in short  my dear friend   said I   you feel as blest as you deserve to feel!    Oh! That s your partiality!  laughed Traddles   But  indeed  I am in a most enviable state  I work hard  and read Law insatiably  I get up at five every morning  and don t mind it at all  I hide the girls in the daytime  and make merry with them in the evening  And I assure you I am quite sorry that they are going home on Tuesday  which is the day before the first day of Michaelmas Term  But here   said Traddles  breaking off in his confidence  and speaking aloud   ARE the girls! Mr  Copperfield  Miss Crewler--Miss Sarah--Miss Louisa--Margaret and Lucy!   They were a perfect nest of roses; they looked so wholesome and fresh  They were all pretty  and Miss Caroline was very handsome; but there was a loving  cheerful  fireside quality in Sophy s bright looks  which was better than that  and which assured me that my friend had chosen well  We all sat round the fire; while the sharp boy  who I now divined had lost his breath in putting the papers out  cleared them away again  and produced the tea-things  After that  he retired for the night  shutting the outer door upon us with a bang  Mrs  Traddles  with perfect pleasure and composure beaming from her household eyes  having made the tea  then quietly made the toast as she sat in a corner by the fire   She had seen Agnes  she told me while she was toasting   Tom  had taken her down into Kent for a wedding trip  and there she had seen my aunt  too; and both my aunt and Agnes were well  and they had all talked of nothing but me   Tom  had never had me out of his thoughts  she really believed  all the time I had been away   Tom  was the authority for everything   Tom  was evidently the idol of her life; never to be shaken on his pedestal by any commotion; always to be believed in  and done homage to with the whole faith of her heart  come what might   The deference which both she and Traddles showed towards the Beauty  pleased me very much  I don t know that I thought it very reasonable; but I thought it very delightful  and essentially a part of their character  If Traddles ever for an instant missed the tea-spoons that were still to be won  I have no doubt it was when he handed the Beauty her tea  If his sweet-tempered wife could have got up any self-assertion against anyone  I am satisfied it could only have been because she was the Beauty s sister  A few slight indications of a rather petted and capricious manner  which I observed in the Beauty  were manifestly considered  by Traddles and his wife  as her birthright and natural endowment  If she had been born a Queen Bee  and they labouring Bees  they could not have been more satisfied of that   But their self-forgetfulness charmed me  Their pride in these girls  and their submission of themselves to all their whims  was the pleasantest little testimony to their own worth I could have desired to see  If Traddles were addressed as  a darling   once in the course of that evening; and besought to bring something here  or carry something there  or take something up  or put something down  or find something  or fetch something  he was so addressed  by one or other of his sisters-in-law  at least twelve times in an hour  Neither could they do anything without Sophy  Somebody s hair fell down  and nobody but Sophy could put it up  Somebody forgot how a particular tune went  and nobody but Sophy could hum that tune right  Somebody wanted to recall the name of a place in Devonshire  and only Sophy knew it  Something was wanted to be written home  and Sophy alone could be trusted to write before breakfast in the morning  Somebody broke down in a piece of knitting  and no one but Sophy was able to put the defaulter in the right direction  They were entire mistresses of the place  and Sophy and Traddles waited on them  How many children Sophy could have taken care of in her time  I can t imagine; but she seemed to be famous for knowing every sort of song that ever was addressed to a child in the English tongue; and she sang dozens to order with the clearest little voice in the world  one after another  every sister issuing directions for a different tune  and the Beauty generally striking in last   so that I was quite fascinated  The best of all was  that  in the midst of their exactions  all the sisters had a great tenderness and respect both for Sophy and Traddles  I am sure  when I took my leave  and Traddles was coming out to walk with me to the coffee-house  I thought I had never seen an obstinate head of hair  or any other head of hair  rolling about in such a shower of kisses   Altogether  it was a scene I could not help dwelling on with pleasure  for a long time after I got back and had wished Traddles good night  If I had beheld a thousand roses blowing in a top set of chambers  in that withered Gray s Inn  they could not have brightened it half so much  The idea of those Devonshire girls  among the dry law-stationers and the attorneys  offices; and of the tea and toast  and children s songs  in that grim atmosphere of pounce and parchment  red-tape  dusty wafers  ink-jars  brief and draft paper  law reports  writs  declarations  and bills of costs; seemed almost as pleasantly fanciful as if I had dreamed that the Sultan s famous family had been admitted on the roll of attorneys  and had brought the talking bird  the singing tree  and the golden water into Gray s Inn Hall  Somehow  I found that I had taken leave of Traddles for the night  and come back to the coffee-house  with a great change in my despondency about him  I began to think he would get on  in spite of all the many orders of chief waiters in England   Drawing a chair before one of the coffee-room fires to think about him at my leisure  I gradually fell from the consideration of his happiness to tracing prospects in the live-coals  and to thinking  as they broke and changed  of the principal vicissitudes and separations that had marked my life  I had not seen a coal fire  since I had left England three years ago: though many a wood fire had I watched  as it crumbled into hoary ashes  and mingled with the feathery heap upon the hearth  which not inaptly figured to me  in my despondency  my own dead hopes   I could think of the past now  gravely  but not bitterly; and could contemplate the future in a brave spirit  Home  in its best sense  was for me no more  She in whom I might have inspired a dearer love  I had taught to be my sister  She would marry  and would have new claimants on her tenderness; and in doing it  would never know the love for her that had grown up in my heart  It was right that I should pay the forfeit of my headlong passion  What I reaped  I had sown   I was thinking  And had I truly disciplined my heart to this  and could I resolutely bear it  and calmly hold the place in her home which she had calmly held in mine --when I found my eyes resting on a countenance that might have arisen out of the fire  in its association with my early remembrances   Little Mr  Chillip the Doctor  to whose good offices I was indebted in the very first chapter of this history  sat reading a newspaper in the shadow of an opposite corner  He was tolerably stricken in years by this time; but  being a mild  meek  calm little man  had worn so easily  that I thought he looked at that moment just as he might have looked when he sat in our parlour  waiting for me to be born   Mr  Chillip had left Blunderstone six or seven years ago  and I had never seen him since  He sat placidly perusing the newspaper  with his little head on one side  and a glass of warm sherry negus at his elbow  He was so extremely conciliatory in his manner that he seemed to apologize to the very newspaper for taking the liberty of reading it   I walked up to where he was sitting  and said   How do you do  Mr  Chillip    He was greatly fluttered by this unexpected address from a stranger  and replied  in his slow way   I thank you  sir  you are very good  Thank you  sir  I hope YOU are well     You don t remember me   said I    Well  sir   returned Mr  Chillip  smiling very meekly  and shaking his head as he surveyed me   I have a kind of an impression that something in your countenance is familiar to me  sir; but I couldn t lay my hand upon your name  really     And yet you knew it  long before I knew it myself   I returned    Did I indeed  sir   said Mr  Chillip   Is it possible that I had the honour  sir  of officiating when--     Yes   said I    Dear me!  cried Mr  Chillip   But no doubt you are a good deal changed since then  sir     Probably   said I    Well  sir   observed Mr  Chillip   I hope you ll excuse me  if I am compelled to ask the favour of your name    On my telling him my name  he was really moved  He quite shook hands with me--which was a violent proceeding for him  his usual course being to slide a tepid little fish-slice  an inch or two in advance of his hip  and evince the greatest discomposure when anybody grappled with it  Even now  he put his hand in his coat-pocket as soon as he could disengage it  and seemed relieved when he had got it safe back    Dear me  sir!  said Mr  Chillip  surveying me with his head on one side   And it s Mr  Copperfield  is it  Well  sir  I think I should have known you  if I had taken the liberty of looking more closely at you  There s a strong resemblance between you and your poor father  sir     I never had the happiness of seeing my father   I observed    Very true  sir   said Mr  Chillip  in a soothing tone   And very much to be deplored it was  on all accounts! We are not ignorant  sir   said Mr  Chillip  slowly shaking his little head again   down in our part of the country  of your fame  There must be great excitement here  sir   said Mr  Chillip  tapping himself on the forehead with his forefinger   You must find it a trying occupation  sir!    What is your part of the country now   I asked  seating myself near him    I am established within a few miles of Bury St  Edmund s  sir   said Mr  Chillip   Mrs  Chillip  coming into a little property in that neighbourhood  under her father s will  I bought a practice down there  in which you will be glad to hear I am doing well  My daughter is growing quite a tall lass now  sir   said Mr  Chillip  giving his little head another little shake   Her mother let down two tucks in her frocks only last week  Such is time  you see  sir!   As the little man put his now empty glass to his lips  when he made this reflection  I proposed to him to have it refilled  and I would keep him company with another   Well  sir   he returned  in his slow way   it s more than I am accustomed to; but I can t deny myself the pleasure of your conversation  It seems but yesterday that I had the honour of attending you in the measles  You came through them charmingly  sir!   I acknowledged this compliment  and ordered the negus  which was soon produced   Quite an uncommon dissipation!  said Mr  Chillip  stirring it   but I can t resist so extraordinary an occasion  You have no family  sir    I shook my head    I was aware that you sustained a bereavement  sir  some time ago   said Mr  Chillip   I heard it from your father-in-law s sister  Very decided character there  sir     Why  yes   said I   decided enough  Where did you see her  Mr  Chillip     Are you not aware  sir   returned Mr  Chillip  with his placidest smile   that your father-in-law is again a neighbour of mine     No   said I    He is indeed  sir!  said Mr  Chillip   Married a young lady of that part  with a very good little property  poor thing ---And this action of the brain now  sir  Don t you find it fatigue you   said Mr  Chillip  looking at me like an admiring Robin   I waived that question  and returned to the Murdstones   I was aware of his being married again  Do you attend the family   I asked    Not regularly  I have been called in   he replied   Strong phrenological developments of the organ of firmness  in Mr  Murdstone and his sister  sir    I replied with such an expressive look  that Mr  Chillip was emboldened by that  and the negus together  to give his head several short shakes  and thoughtfully exclaim   Ah  dear me! We remember old times  Mr  Copperfield!    And the brother and sister are pursuing their old course  are they   said I    Well  sir   replied Mr  Chillip   a medical man  being so much in families  ought to have neither eyes nor ears for anything but his profession  Still  I must say  they are very severe  sir: both as to this life and the next     The next will be regulated without much reference to them  I dare say   I returned:  what are they doing as to this    Mr  Chillip shook his head  stirred his negus  and sipped it    She was a charming woman  sir!  he observed in a plaintive manner    The present Mrs  Murdstone     A charming woman indeed  sir   said Mr  Chillip;  as amiable  I am sure  as it was possible to be! Mrs  Chillip s opinion is  that her spirit has been entirely broken since her marriage  and that she is all but melancholy mad  And the ladies   observed Mr  Chillip  timorously   are great observers  sir     I suppose she was to be subdued and broken to their detestable mould  Heaven help her!  said I   And she has been     Well  sir  there were violent quarrels at first  I assure you   said Mr  Chillip;  but she is quite a shadow now  Would it be considered forward if I was to say to you  sir  in confidence  that since the sister came to help  the brother and sister between them have nearly reduced her to a state of imbecility    I told him I could easily believe it    I have no hesitation in saying   said Mr  Chillip  fortifying himself with another sip of negus   between you and me  sir  that her mother died of it--or that tyranny  gloom  and worry have made Mrs  Murdstone nearly imbecile  She was a lively young woman  sir  before marriage  and their gloom and austerity destroyed her  They go about with her  now  more like her keepers than her husband and sister-in-law  That was Mrs  Chillip s remark to me  only last week  And I assure you  sir  the ladies are great observers  Mrs  Chillip herself is a great observer!    Does he gloomily profess to be  I am ashamed to use the word in such association  religious still   I inquired    You anticipate  sir   said Mr  Chillip  his eyelids getting quite red with the unwonted stimulus in which he was indulging   One of Mrs  Chillip s most impressive remarks  Mrs  Chillip   he proceeded  in the calmest and slowest manner   quite electrified me  by pointing out that Mr  Murdstone sets up an image of himself  and calls it the Divine Nature  You might have knocked me down on the flat of my back  sir  with the feather of a pen  I assure you  when Mrs  Chillip said so  The ladies are great observers  sir     Intuitively   said I  to his extreme delight    I am very happy to receive such support in my opinion  sir   he rejoined   It is not often that I venture to give a non-medical opinion  I assure you  Mr  Murdstone delivers public addresses sometimes  and it is said --in short  sir  it is said by Mrs  Chillip --that the darker tyrant he has lately been  the more ferocious is his doctrine     I believe Mrs  Chillip to be perfectly right   said I    Mrs  Chillip does go so far as to say   pursued the meekest of little men  much encouraged   that what such people miscall their religion  is a vent for their bad humours and arrogance  And do you know I must say  sir   he continued  mildly laying his head on one side   that I DON T find authority for Mr  and Miss Murdstone in the New Testament     I never found it either!  said I    In the meantime  sir   said Mr  Chillip   they are much disliked; and as they are very free in consigning everybody who dislikes them to perdition  we really have a good deal of perdition going on in our neighbourhood! However  as Mrs  Chillip says  sir  they undergo a continual punishment; for they are turned inward  to feed upon their own hearts  and their own hearts are very bad feeding  Now  sir  about that brain of yours  if you ll excuse my returning to it  Don t you expose it to a good deal of excitement  sir    I found it not difficult  in the excitement of Mr  Chillip s own brain  under his potations of negus  to divert his attention from this topic to his own affairs  on which  for the next half-hour  he was quite loquacious; giving me to understand  among other pieces of information  that he was then at the Gray s Inn Coffee-house to lay his professional evidence before a Commission of Lunacy  touching the state of mind of a patient who had become deranged from excessive drinking   And I assure you  sir   he said   I am extremely nervous on such occasions  I could not support being what is called Bullied  sir  It would quite unman me  Do you know it was some time before I recovered the conduct of that alarming lady  on the night of your birth  Mr  Copperfield    I told him that I was going down to my aunt  the Dragon of that night  early in the morning; and that she was one of the most tender-hearted and excellent of women  as he would know full well if he knew her better  The mere notion of the possibility of his ever seeing her again  appeared to terrify him  He replied with a small pale smile   Is she so  indeed  sir  Really   and almost immediately called for a candle  and went to bed  as if he were not quite safe anywhere else  He did not actually stagger under the negus; but I should think his placid little pulse must have made two or three more beats in a minute  than it had done since the great night of my aunt s disappointment  when she struck at him with her bonnet   Thoroughly tired  I went to bed too  at midnight; passed the next day on the Dover coach; burst safe and sound into my aunt s old parlour while she was at tea  she wore spectacles now ; and was received by her  and Mr  Dick  and dear old Peggotty  who acted as housekeeper  with open arms and tears of joy  My aunt was mightily amused  when we began to talk composedly  by my account of my meeting with Mr  Chillip  and of his holding her in such dread remembrance; and both she and Peggotty had a great deal to say about my poor mother s second husband  and  that murdering woman of a sister  --on whom I think no pain or penalty would have induced my aunt to bestow any Christian or Proper Name  or any other designation     CHAPTER 60  AGNES   My aunt and I  when we were left alone  talked far into the night  How the emigrants never wrote home  otherwise than cheerfully and hopefully; how Mr  Micawber had actually remitted divers small sums of money  on account of those  pecuniary liabilities   in reference to which he had been so business-like as between man and man; how Janet  returning into my aunt s service when she came back to Dover  had finally carried out her renunciation of mankind by entering into wedlock with a thriving tavern-keeper; and how my aunt had finally set her seal on the same great principle  by aiding and abetting the bride  and crowning the marriage-ceremony with her presence; were among our topics--already more or less familiar to me through the letters I had had  Mr  Dick  as usual  was not forgotten  My aunt informed me how he incessantly occupied himself in copying everything he could lay his hands on  and kept King Charles the First at a respectful distance by that semblance of employment; how it was one of the main joys and rewards of her life that he was free and happy  instead of pining in monotonous restraint; and how  as a novel general conclusion  nobody but she could ever fully know what he was    And when  Trot   said my aunt  patting the back of my hand  as we sat in our old way before the fire   when are you going over to Canterbury     I shall get a horse  and ride over tomorrow morning  aunt  unless you will go with me     No!  said my aunt  in her short abrupt way   I mean to stay where I am    Then  I should ride  I said  I could not have come through Canterbury today without stopping  if I had been coming to anyone but her   She was pleased  but answered   Tut  Trot; MY old bones would have kept till tomorrow!  and softly patted my hand again  as I sat looking thoughtfully at the fire   Thoughtfully  for I could not be here once more  and so near Agnes  without the revival of those regrets with which I had so long been occupied  Softened regrets they might be  teaching me what I had failed to learn when my younger life was all before me  but not the less regrets   Oh  Trot   I seemed to hear my aunt say once more; and I understood her better now-- Blind  blind  blind!   We both kept silence for some minutes  When I raised my eyes  I found that she was steadily observant of me  Perhaps she had followed the current of my mind; for it seemed to me an easy one to track now  wilful as it had been once    You will find her father a white-haired old man   said my aunt   though a better man in all other respects--a reclaimed man  Neither will you find him measuring all human interests  and joys  and sorrows  with his one poor little inch-rule now  Trust me  child  such things must shrink very much  before they can be measured off in that way     Indeed they must   said I    You will find her   pursued my aunt   as good  as beautiful  as earnest  as disinterested  as she has always been  If I knew higher praise  Trot  I would bestow it on her    There was no higher praise for her; no higher reproach for me  Oh  how had I strayed so far away!   If she trains the young girls whom she has about her  to be like herself   said my aunt  earnest even to the filling of her eyes with tears   Heaven knows  her life will be well employed! Useful and happy  as she said that day! How could she be otherwise than useful and happy!    Has Agnes any--  I was thinking aloud  rather than speaking    Well  Hey  Any what   said my aunt  sharply    Any lover   said I    A score   cried my aunt  with a kind of indignant pride   She might have married twenty times  my dear  since you have been gone!    No doubt   said I   No doubt  But has she any lover who is worthy of her  Agnes could care for no other    My aunt sat musing for a little while  with her chin upon her hand  Slowly raising her eyes to mine  she said:   I suspect she has an attachment  Trot     A prosperous one   said I    Trot   returned my aunt gravely   I can t say  I have no right to tell you even so much  She has never confided it to me  but I suspect it    She looked so attentively and anxiously at me  I even saw her tremble   that I felt now  more than ever  that she had followed my late thoughts  I summoned all the resolutions I had made  in all those many days and nights  and all those many conflicts of my heart    If it should be so   I began   and I hope it is-    I don t know that it is   said my aunt curtly   You must not be ruled by my suspicions  You must keep them secret  They are very slight  perhaps  I have no right to speak     If it should be so   I repeated   Agnes will tell me at her own good time  A sister to whom I have confided so much  aunt  will not be reluctant to confide in me    My aunt withdrew her eyes from mine  as slowly as she had turned them upon me; and covered them thoughtfully with her hand  By and by she put her other hand on my shoulder; and so we both sat  looking into the past  without saying another word  until we parted for the night   I rode away  early in the morning  for the scene of my old school-days  I cannot say that I was yet quite happy  in the hope that I was gaining a victory over myself; even in the prospect of so soon looking on her face again   The well-remembered ground was soon traversed  and I came into the quiet streets  where every stone was a boy s book to me  I went on foot to the old house  and went away with a heart too full to enter  I returned; and looking  as I passed  through the low window of the turret-room where first Uriah Heep  and afterwards Mr  Micawber  had been wont to sit  saw that it was a little parlour now  and that there was no office  Otherwise the staid old house was  as to its cleanliness and order  still just as it had been when I first saw it  I requested the new maid who admitted me  to tell Miss Wickfield that a gentleman who waited on her from a friend abroad  was there; and I was shown up the grave old staircase  cautioned of the steps I knew so well   into the unchanged drawing-room  The books that Agnes and I had read together  were on their shelves; and the desk where I had laboured at my lessons  many a night  stood yet at the same old corner of the table  All the little changes that had crept in when the Heeps were there  were changed again  Everything was as it used to be  in the happy time   I stood in a window  and looked across the ancient street at the opposite houses  recalling how I had watched them on wet afternoons  when I first came there; and how I had used to speculate about the people who appeared at any of the windows  and had followed them with my eyes up and down stairs  while women went clicking along the pavement in pattens  and the dull rain fell in slanting lines  and poured out of the water-spout yonder  and flowed into the road  The feeling with which I used to watch the tramps  as they came into the town on those wet evenings  at dusk  and limped past  with their bundles drooping over their shoulders at the ends of sticks  came freshly back to me; fraught  as then  with the smell of damp earth  and wet leaves and briar  and the sensation of the very airs that blew upon me in my own toilsome journey   The opening of the little door in the panelled wall made me start and turn  Her beautiful serene eyes met mine as she came towards me  She stopped and laid her hand upon her bosom  and I caught her in my arms    Agnes! my dear girl! I have come too suddenly upon you     No  no! I am so rejoiced to see you  Trotwood!    Dear Agnes  the happiness it is to me  to see you once again!   I folded her to my heart  and  for a little while  we were both silent  Presently we sat down  side by side; and her angel-face was turned upon me with the welcome I had dreamed of  waking and sleeping  for whole years   She was so true  she was so beautiful  she was so good --I owed her so much gratitude  she was so dear to me  that I could find no utterance for what I felt  I tried to bless her  tried to thank her  tried to tell her  as I had often done in letters  what an influence she had upon me; but all my efforts were in vain  My love and joy were dumb   With her own sweet tranquillity  she calmed my agitation; led me back to the time of our parting; spoke to me of Emily  whom she had visited  in secret  many times; spoke to me tenderly of Dora s grave  With the unerring instinct of her noble heart  she touched the chords of my memory so softly and harmoniously  that not one jarred within me; I could listen to the sorrowful  distant music  and desire to shrink from nothing it awoke  How could I  when  blended with it all  was her dear self  the better angel of my life    And you  Agnes   I said  by and by   Tell me of yourself  You have hardly ever told me of your own life  in all this lapse of time!    What should I tell   she answered  with her radiant smile   Papa is well  You see us here  quiet in our own home; our anxieties set at rest  our home restored to us; and knowing that  dear Trotwood  you know all     All  Agnes   said I   She looked at me  with some fluttering wonder in her face    Is there nothing else  Sister   I said   Her colour  which had just now faded  returned  and faded again  She smiled; with a quiet sadness  I thought; and shook her head   I had sought to lead her to what my aunt had hinted at; for  sharply painful to me as it must be to receive that confidence  I was to discipline my heart  and do my duty to her  I saw  however  that she was uneasy  and I let it pass    You have much to do  dear Agnes     With my school   said she  looking up again  in all her bright composure    Yes  It is laborious  is it not     The labour is so pleasant   she returned   that it is scarcely grateful in me to call it by that name     Nothing good is difficult to you   said I   Her colour came and went once more; and once more  as she bent her head  I saw the same sad smile    You will wait and see papa   said Agnes  cheerfully   and pass the day with us  Perhaps you will sleep in your own room  We always call it yours    I could not do that  having promised to ride back to my aunt s at night; but I would pass the day there  joyfully    I must be a prisoner for a little while   said Agnes   but here are the old books  Trotwood  and the old music     Even the old flowers are here   said I  looking round;  or the old kinds     I have found a pleasure   returned Agnes  smiling   while you have been absent  in keeping everything as it used to be when we were children  For we were very happy then  I think     Heaven knows we were!  said I    And every little thing that has reminded me of my brother   said Agnes  with her cordial eyes turned cheerfully upon me   has been a welcome companion  Even this   showing me the basket-trifle  full of keys  still hanging at her side   seems to jingle a kind of old tune!   She smiled again  and went out at the door by which she had come   It was for me to guard this sisterly affection with religious care  It was all that I had left myself  and it was a treasure  If I once shook the foundations of the sacred confidence and usage  in virtue of which it was given to me  it was lost  and could never be recovered  I set this steadily before myself  The better I loved her  the more it behoved me never to forget it   I walked through the streets; and  once more seeing my old adversary the butcher--now a constable  with his staff hanging up in the shop--went down to look at the place where I had fought him; and there meditated on Miss Shepherd and the eldest Miss Larkins  and all the idle loves and likings  and dislikings  of that time  Nothing seemed to have survived that time but Agnes; and she  ever a star above me  was brighter and higher   When I returned  Mr  Wickfield had come home  from a garden he had  a couple of miles or so out of town  where he now employed himself almost every day  I found him as my aunt had described him  We sat down to dinner  with some half-dozen little girls; and he seemed but the shadow of his handsome picture on the wall   The tranquillity and peace belonging  of old  to that quiet ground in my memory  pervaded it again  When dinner was done  Mr  Wickfield taking no wine  and I desiring none  we went up-stairs; where Agnes and her little charges sang and played  and worked  After tea the children left us; and we three sat together  talking of the bygone days    My part in them   said Mr  Wickfield  shaking his white head   has much matter for regret--for deep regret  and deep contrition  Trotwood  you well know  But I would not cancel it  if it were in my power    I could readily believe that  looking at the face beside him    I should cancel with it   he pursued   such patience and devotion  such fidelity  such a child s love  as I must not forget  no! even to forget myself     I understand you  sir   I softly said   I hold it--I have always held it--in veneration     But no one knows  not even you   he returned   how much she has done  how much she has undergone  how hard she has striven  Dear Agnes!   She had put her hand entreatingly on his arm  to stop him; and was very  very pale    Well  well!  he said with a sigh  dismissing  as I then saw  some trial she had borne  or was yet to bear  in connexion with what my aunt had told me   Well! I have never told you  Trotwood  of her mother  Has anyone     Never  sir     It s not much--though it was much to suffer  She married me in opposition to her father s wish  and he renounced her  She prayed him to forgive her  before my Agnes came into this world  He was a very hard man  and her mother had long been dead  He repulsed her  He broke her heart    Agnes leaned upon his shoulder  and stole her arm about his neck    She had an affectionate and gentle heart   he said;  and it was broken  I knew its tender nature very well  No one could  if I did not  She loved me dearly  but was never happy  She was always labouring  in secret  under this distress; and being delicate and downcast at the time of his last repulse--for it was not the first  by many--pined away and died  She left me Agnes  two weeks old; and the grey hair that you recollect me with  when you first came   He kissed Agnes on her cheek    My love for my dear child was a diseased love  but my mind was all unhealthy then  I say no more of that  I am not speaking of myself  Trotwood  but of her mother  and of her  If I give you any clue to what I am  or to what I have been  you will unravel it  I know  What Agnes is  I need not say  I have always read something of her poor mother s story  in her character; and so I tell it you tonight  when we three are again together  after such great changes  I have told it all    His bowed head  and her angel-face and filial duty  derived a more pathetic meaning from it than they had had before  If I had wanted anything by which to mark this night of our re-union  I should have found it in this   Agnes rose up from her father s side  before long; and going softly to her piano  played some of the old airs to which we had often listened in that place    Have you any intention of going away again   Agnes asked me  as I was standing by    What does my sister say to that     I hope not     Then I have no such intention  Agnes     I think you ought not  Trotwood  since you ask me   she said  mildly   Your growing reputation and success enlarge your power of doing good; and if I could spare my brother   with her eyes upon me   perhaps the time could not     What I am  you have made me  Agnes  You should know best     I made you  Trotwood     Yes! Agnes  my dear girl!  I said  bending over her   I tried to tell you  when we met today  something that has been in my thoughts since Dora died  You remember  when you came down to me in our little room--pointing upward  Agnes     Oh  Trotwood!  she returned  her eyes filled with tears   So loving  so confiding  and so young! Can I ever forget     As you were then  my sister  I have often thought since  you have ever been to me  Ever pointing upward  Agnes; ever leading me to something better; ever directing me to higher things!   She only shook her head; through her tears I saw the same sad quiet smile    And I am so grateful to you for it  Agnes  so bound to you  that there is no name for the affection of my heart  I want you to know  yet don t know how to tell you  that all my life long I shall look up to you  and be guided by you  as I have been through the darkness that is past  Whatever betides  whatever new ties you may form  whatever changes may come between us  I shall always look to you  and love you  as I do now  and have always done  You will always be my solace and resource  as you have always been  Until I die  my dearest sister  I shall see you always before me  pointing upward!   She put her hand in mine  and told me she was proud of me  and of what I said; although I praised her very far beyond her worth  Then she went on softly playing  but without removing her eyes from me   Do you know  what I have heard tonight  Agnes   said I  strangely seems to be a part of the feeling with which I regarded you when I saw you first--with which I sat beside you in my rough school-days     You knew I had no mother   she replied with a smile   and felt kindly towards me     More than that  Agnes  I knew  almost as if I had known this story  that there was something inexplicably gentle and softened  surrounding you; something that might have been sorrowful in someone else  as I can now understand it was   but was not so in you    She softly played on  looking at me still    Will you laugh at my cherishing such fancies  Agnes     No!    Or at my saying that I really believe I felt  even then  that you could be faithfully affectionate against all discouragement  and never cease to be so  until you ceased to live ---Will you laugh at such a dream     Oh  no! Oh  no!   For an instant  a distressful shadow crossed her face; but  even in the start it gave me  it was gone; and she was playing on  and looking at me with her own calm smile   As I rode back in the lonely night  the wind going by me like a restless memory  I thought of this  and feared she was not happy  I was not happy; but  thus far  I had faithfully set the seal upon the Past  and  thinking of her  pointing upward  thought of her as pointing to that sky above me  where  in the mystery to come  I might yet love her with a love unknown on earth  and tell her what the strife had been within me when I loved her here     CHAPTER 61  I AM SHOWN TWO INTERESTING PENITENTS   For a time--at all events until my book should be completed  which would be the work of several months--I took up my abode in my aunt s house at Dover; and there  sitting in the window from which I had looked out at the moon upon the sea  when that roof first gave me shelter  I quietly pursued my task   In pursuance of my intention of referring to my own fictions only when their course should incidentally connect itself with the progress of my story  I do not enter on the aspirations  the delights  anxieties  and triumphs of my art  That I truly devoted myself to it with my strongest earnestness  and bestowed upon it every energy of my soul  I have already said  If the books I have written be of any worth  they will supply the rest  I shall otherwise have written to poor purpose  and the rest will be of interest to no one   Occasionally  I went to London; to lose myself in the swarm of life there  or to consult with Traddles on some business point  He had managed for me  in my absence  with the soundest judgement; and my worldly affairs were prospering  As my notoriety began to bring upon me an enormous quantity of letters from people of whom I had no knowledge--chiefly about nothing  and extremely difficult to answer--I agreed with Traddles to have my name painted up on his door  There  the devoted postman on that beat delivered bushels of letters for me; and there  at intervals  I laboured through them  like a Home Secretary of State without the salary   Among this correspondence  there dropped in  every now and then  an obliging proposal from one of the numerous outsiders always lurking about the Commons  to practise under cover of my name  if I would take the necessary steps remaining to make a proctor of myself   and pay me a percentage on the profits  But I declined these offers; being already aware that there were plenty of such covert practitioners in existence  and considering the Commons quite bad enough  without my doing anything to make it worse   The girls had gone home  when my name burst into bloom on Traddles s door; and the sharp boy looked  all day  as if he had never heard of Sophy  shut up in a back room  glancing down from her work into a sooty little strip of garden with a pump in it  But there I always found her  the same bright housewife; often humming her Devonshire ballads when no strange foot was coming up the stairs  and blunting the sharp boy in his official closet with melody   I wondered  at first  why I so often found Sophy writing in a copy-book; and why she always shut it up when I appeared  and hurried it into the table-drawer  But the secret soon came out  One day  Traddles  who had just come home through the drizzling sleet from Court  took a paper out of his desk  and asked me what I thought of that handwriting    Oh  DON T  Tom!  cried Sophy  who was warming his slippers before the fire    My dear   returned Tom  in a delighted state   why not  What do you say to that writing  Copperfield     It s extraordinarily legal and formal   said I   I don t think I ever saw such a stiff hand     Not like a lady s hand  is it   said Traddles    A lady s!  I repeated   Bricks and mortar are more like a lady s hand!   Traddles broke into a rapturous laugh  and informed me that it was Sophy s writing; that Sophy had vowed and declared he would need a copying-clerk soon  and she would be that clerk; that she had acquired this hand from a pattern; and that she could throw off--I forget how many folios an hour  Sophy was very much confused by my being told all this  and said that when  Tom  was made a judge he wouldn t be so ready to proclaim it  Which  Tom  denied; averring that he should always be equally proud of it  under all circumstances    What a thoroughly good and charming wife she is  my dear Traddles!  said I  when she had gone away  laughing    My dear Copperfield   returned Traddles   she is  without any exception  the dearest girl! The way she manages this place; her punctuality  domestic knowledge  economy  and order; her cheerfulness  Copperfield!    Indeed  you have reason to commend her!  I returned   You are a happy fellow  I believe you make yourselves  and each other  two of the happiest people in the world     I am sure we ARE two of the happiest people   returned Traddles   I admit that  at all events  Bless my soul  when I see her getting up by candle-light on these dark mornings  busying herself in the day s arrangements  going out to market before the clerks come into the Inn  caring for no weather  devising the most capital little dinners out of the plainest materials  making puddings and pies  keeping everything in its right place  always so neat and ornamental herself  sitting up at night with me if it s ever so late  sweet-tempered and encouraging always  and all for me  I positively sometimes can t believe it  Copperfield!   He was tender of the very slippers she had been warming  as he put them on  and stretched his feet enjoyingly upon the fender    I positively sometimes can t believe it   said Traddles   Then our pleasures! Dear me  they are inexpensive  but they are quite wonderful! When we are at home here  of an evening  and shut the outer door  and draw those curtains--which she made--where could we be more snug  When it s fine  and we go out for a walk in the evening  the streets abound in enjoyment for us  We look into the glittering windows of the jewellers  shops; and I show Sophy which of the diamond-eyed serpents  coiled up on white satin rising grounds  I would give her if I could afford it; and Sophy shows me which of the gold watches that are capped and jewelled and engine-turned  and possessed of the horizontal lever-escape-movement  and all sorts of things  she would buy for me if she could afford it; and we pick out the spoons and forks  fish-slices  butter-knives  and sugar-tongs  we should both prefer if we could both afford it; and really we go away as if we had got them! Then  when we stroll into the squares  and great streets  and see a house to let  sometimes we look up at it  and say  how would THAT do  if I was made a judge  And we parcel it out--such a room for us  such rooms for the girls  and so forth; until we settle to our satisfaction that it would do  or it wouldn t do  as the case may be  Sometimes  we go at half-price to the pit of the theatre--the very smell of which is cheap  in my opinion  at the money--and there we thoroughly enjoy the play: which Sophy believes every word of  and so do I  In walking home  perhaps we buy a little bit of something at a cook s-shop  or a little lobster at the fishmongers  and bring it here  and make a splendid supper  chatting about what we have seen  Now  you know  Copperfield  if I was Lord Chancellor  we couldn t do this!    You would do something  whatever you were  my dear Traddles   thought I   that would be pleasant and amiable  And by the way   I said aloud   I suppose you never draw any skeletons now     Really   replied Traddles  laughing  and reddening   I can t wholly deny that I do  my dear Copperfield  For being in one of the back rows of the King s Bench the other day  with a pen in my hand  the fancy came into my head to try how I had preserved that accomplishment  And I am afraid there s a skeleton--in a wig--on the ledge of the desk    After we had both laughed heartily  Traddles wound up by looking with a smile at the fire  and saying  in his forgiving way   Old Creakle!    I have a letter from that old--Rascal here   said I  For I never was less disposed to forgive him the way he used to batter Traddles  than when I saw Traddles so ready to forgive him himself    From Creakle the schoolmaster   exclaimed Traddles   No!    Among the persons who are attracted to me in my rising fame and fortune   said I  looking over my letters   and who discover that they were always much attached to me  is the self-same Creakle  He is not a schoolmaster now  Traddles  He is retired  He is a Middlesex Magistrate    I thought Traddles might be surprised to hear it  but he was not so at all    How do you suppose he comes to be a Middlesex Magistrate   said I    Oh dear me!  replied Traddles   it would be very difficult to answer that question  Perhaps he voted for somebody  or lent money to somebody  or bought something of somebody  or otherwise obliged somebody  or jobbed for somebody  who knew somebody who got the lieutenant of the county to nominate him for the commission     On the commission he is  at any rate   said I   And he writes to me here  that he will be glad to show me  in operation  the only true system of prison discipline; the only unchallengeable way of making sincere and lasting converts and penitents--which  you know  is by solitary confinement  What do you say     To the system   inquired Traddles  looking grave    No  To my accepting the offer  and your going with me     I don t object   said Traddles    Then I ll write to say so  You remember  to say nothing of our treatment  this same Creakle turning his son out of doors  I suppose  and the life he used to lead his wife and daughter     Perfectly   said Traddles    Yet  if you ll read his letter  you ll find he is the tenderest of men to prisoners convicted of the whole calendar of felonies   said I;  though I can t find that his tenderness extends to any other class of created beings    Traddles shrugged his shoulders  and was not at all surprised  I had not expected him to be  and was not surprised myself; or my observation of similar practical satires would have been but scanty  We arranged the time of our visit  and I wrote accordingly to Mr  Creakle that evening   On the appointed day--I think it was the next day  but no matter--Traddles and I repaired to the prison where Mr  Creakle was powerful  It was an immense and solid building  erected at a vast expense  I could not help thinking  as we approached the gate  what an uproar would have been made in the country  if any deluded man had proposed to spend one half the money it had cost  on the erection of an industrial school for the young  or a house of refuge for the deserving old   In an office that might have been on the ground-floor of the Tower of Babel  it was so massively constructed  we were presented to our old schoolmaster; who was one of a group  composed of two or three of the busier sort of magistrates  and some visitors they had brought  He received me  like a man who had formed my mind in bygone years  and had always loved me tenderly  On my introducing Traddles  Mr  Creakle expressed  in like manner  but in an inferior degree  that he had always been Traddles s guide  philosopher  and friend  Our venerable instructor was a great deal older  and not improved in appearance  His face was as fiery as ever; his eyes were as small  and rather deeper set  The scanty  wet-looking grey hair  by which I remembered him  was almost gone; and the thick veins in his bald head were none the more agreeable to look at   After some conversation among these gentlemen  from which I might have supposed that there was nothing in the world to be legitimately taken into account but the supreme comfort of prisoners  at any expense  and nothing on the wide earth to be done outside prison-doors  we began our inspection  It being then just dinner-time  we went  first into the great kitchen  where every prisoner s dinner was in course of being set out separately  to be handed to him in his cell   with the regularity and precision of clock-work  I said aside  to Traddles  that I wondered whether it occurred to anybody  that there was a striking contrast between these plentiful repasts of choice quality  and the dinners  not to say of paupers  but of soldiers  sailors  labourers  the great bulk of the honest  working community; of whom not one man in five hundred ever dined half so well  But I learned that the  system  required high living; and  in short  to dispose of the system  once for all  I found that on that head and on all others   the system  put an end to all doubts  and disposed of all anomalies  Nobody appeared to have the least idea that there was any other system  but THE system  to be considered   As we were going through some of the magnificent passages  I inquired of Mr  Creakle and his friends what were supposed to be the main advantages of this all-governing and universally over-riding system  I found them to be the perfect isolation of prisoners--so that no one man in confinement there  knew anything about another; and the reduction of prisoners to a wholesome state of mind  leading to sincere contrition and repentance   Now  it struck me  when we began to visit individuals in their cells  and to traverse the passages in which those cells were  and to have the manner of the going to chapel and so forth  explained to us  that there was a strong probability of the prisoners knowing a good deal about each other  and of their carrying on a pretty complete system of intercourse  This  at the time I write  has been proved  I believe  to be the case; but  as it would have been flat blasphemy against the system to have hinted such a doubt then  I looked out for the penitence as diligently as I could   And here again  I had great misgivings  I found as prevalent a fashion in the form of the penitence  as I had left outside in the forms of the coats and waistcoats in the windows of the tailors  shops  I found a vast amount of profession  varying very little in character: varying very little  which I thought exceedingly suspicious   even in words  I found a great many foxes  disparaging whole vineyards of inaccessible grapes; but I found very few foxes whom I would have trusted within reach of a bunch  Above all  I found that the most professing men were the greatest objects of interest; and that their conceit  their vanity  their want of excitement  and their love of deception  which many of them possessed to an almost incredible extent  as their histories showed   all prompted to these professions  and were all gratified by them   However  I heard so repeatedly  in the course of our goings to and fro  of a certain Number Twenty Seven  who was the Favourite  and who really appeared to be a Model Prisoner  that I resolved to suspend my judgement until I should see Twenty Seven  Twenty Eight  I understood  was also a bright particular star; but it was his misfortune to have his glory a little dimmed by the extraordinary lustre of Twenty Seven  I heard so much of Twenty Seven  of his pious admonitions to everybody around him  and of the beautiful letters he constantly wrote to his mother  whom he seemed to consider in a very bad way   that I became quite impatient to see him   I had to restrain my impatience for some time  on account of Twenty Seven being reserved for a concluding effect  But  at last  we came to the door of his cell; and Mr  Creakle  looking through a little hole in it  reported to us  in a state of the greatest admiration  that he was reading a Hymn Book   There was such a rush of heads immediately  to see Number Twenty Seven reading his Hymn Book  that the little hole was blocked up  six or seven heads deep  To remedy this inconvenience  and give us an opportunity of conversing with Twenty Seven in all his purity  Mr  Creakle directed the door of the cell to be unlocked  and Twenty Seven to be invited out into the passage  This was done; and whom should Traddles and I then behold  to our amazement  in this converted Number Twenty Seven  but Uriah Heep!  He knew us directly; and said  as he came out--with the old writhe --   How do you do  Mr  Copperfield  How do you do  Mr  Traddles    This recognition caused a general admiration in the party  I rather thought that everyone was struck by his not being proud  and taking notice of us    Well  Twenty Seven   said Mr  Creakle  mournfully admiring him   How do you find yourself today     I am very umble  sir!  replied Uriah Heep    You are always so  Twenty Seven   said Mr  Creakle   Here  another gentleman asked  with extreme anxiety:  Are you quite comfortable     Yes  I thank you  sir!  said Uriah Heep  looking in that direction   Far more comfortable here  than ever I was outside  I see my follies  now  sir  That s what makes me comfortable    Several gentlemen were much affected; and a third questioner  forcing himself to the front  inquired with extreme feeling:  How do you find the beef     Thank you  sir   replied Uriah  glancing in the new direction of this voice   it was tougher yesterday than I could wish; but it s my duty to bear  I have committed follies  gentlemen   said Uriah  looking round with a meek smile   and I ought to bear the consequences without repining   A murmur  partly of gratification at Twenty Seven s celestial state of mind  and partly of indignation against the Contractor who had given him any cause of complaint  a note of which was immediately made by Mr  Creakle   having subsided  Twenty Seven stood in the midst of us  as if he felt himself the principal object of merit in a highly meritorious museum  That we  the neophytes  might have an excess of light shining upon us all at once  orders were given to let out Twenty Eight   I had been so much astonished already  that I only felt a kind of resigned wonder when Mr  Littimer walked forth  reading a good book!   Twenty Eight   said a gentleman in spectacles  who had not yet spoken   you complained last week  my good fellow  of the cocoa  How has it been since     I thank you  sir   said Mr  Littimer   it has been better made  If I might take the liberty of saying so  sir  I don t think the milk which is boiled with it is quite genuine; but I am aware  sir  that there is a great adulteration of milk  in London  and that the article in a pure state is difficult to be obtained    It appeared to me that the gentleman in spectacles backed his Twenty Eight against Mr  Creakle s Twenty Seven  for each of them took his own man in hand    What is your state of mind  Twenty Eight   said the questioner in spectacles    I thank you  sir   returned Mr  Littimer;  I see my follies now  sir  I am a good deal troubled when I think of the sins of my former companions  sir; but I trust they may find forgiveness     You are quite happy yourself   said the questioner  nodding encouragement    I am much obliged to you  sir   returned Mr  Littimer   Perfectly so     Is there anything at all on your mind now   said the questioner   If so  mention it  Twenty Eight     Sir   said Mr  Littimer  without looking up   if my eyes have not deceived me  there is a gentleman present who was acquainted with me in my former life  It may be profitable to that gentleman to know  sir  that I attribute my past follies  entirely to having lived a thoughtless life in the service of young men; and to having allowed myself to be led by them into weaknesses  which I had not the strength to resist  I hope that gentleman will take warning  sir  and will not be offended at my freedom  It is for his good  I am conscious of my own past follies  I hope he may repent of all the wickedness and sin to which he has been a party    I observed that several gentlemen were shading their eyes  each with one hand  as if they had just come into church    This does you credit  Twenty Eight   returned the questioner   I should have expected it of you  Is there anything else     Sir   returned Mr  Littimer  slightly lifting up his eyebrows  but not his eyes   there was a young woman who fell into dissolute courses  that I endeavoured to save  sir  but could not rescue  I beg that gentleman  if he has it in his power  to inform that young woman from me that I forgive her her bad conduct towards myself  and that I call her to repentance--if he will be so good     I have no doubt  Twenty Eight   returned the questioner   that the gentleman you refer to feels very strongly--as we all must--what you have so properly said  We will not detain you     I thank you  sir   said Mr  Littimer   Gentlemen  I wish you a good day  and hoping you and your families will also see your wickedness  and amend!   With this  Number Twenty Eight retired  after a glance between him and Uriah; as if they were not altogether unknown to each other  through some medium of communication; and a murmur went round the group  as his door shut upon him  that he was a most respectable man  and a beautiful case    Now  Twenty Seven   said Mr  Creakle  entering on a clear stage with his man   is there anything that anyone can do for you  If so  mention it     I would umbly ask  sir   returned Uriah  with a jerk of his malevolent head   for leave to write again to mother     It shall certainly be granted   said Mr  Creakle    Thank you  sir! I am anxious about mother  I am afraid she ain t safe    Somebody incautiously asked  what from  But there was a scandalized whisper of  Hush!    Immortally safe  sir   returned Uriah  writhing in the direction of the voice   I should wish mother to be got into my state  I never should have been got into my present state if I hadn t come here  I wish mother had come here  It would be better for everybody  if they got took up  and was brought here    This sentiment gave unbounded satisfaction--greater satisfaction  I think  than anything that had passed yet    Before I come here   said Uriah  stealing a look at us  as if he would have blighted the outer world to which we belonged  if he could   I was given to follies; but now I am sensible of my follies  There s a deal of sin outside  There s a deal of sin in mother  There s nothing but sin everywhere--except here     You are quite changed   said Mr  Creakle    Oh dear  yes  sir!  cried this hopeful penitent    You wouldn t relapse  if you were going out   asked somebody else    Oh de-ar no  sir!    Well!  said Mr  Creakle   this is very gratifying  You have addressed Mr  Copperfield  Twenty Seven  Do you wish to say anything further to him     You knew me  a long time before I came here and was changed  Mr  Copperfield   said Uriah  looking at me; and a more villainous look I never saw  even on his visage   You knew me when  in spite of my follies  I was umble among them that was proud  and meek among them that was violent--you was violent to me yourself  Mr  Copperfield  Once  you struck me a blow in the face  you know    General commiseration  Several indignant glances directed at me    But I forgive you  Mr  Copperfield   said Uriah  making his forgiving nature the subject of a most impious and awful parallel  which I shall not record   I forgive everybody  It would ill become me to bear malice  I freely forgive you  and I hope you ll curb your passions in future  I hope Mr  W  will repent  and Miss W   and all of that sinful lot  You ve been visited with affliction  and I hope it may do you good; but you d better have come here  Mr  W  had better have come here  and Miss W  too  The best wish I could give you  Mr  Copperfield  and give all of you gentlemen  is  that you could be took up and brought here  When I think of my past follies  and my present state  I am sure it would be best for you  I pity all who ain t brought here!   He sneaked back into his cell  amidst a little chorus of approbation; and both Traddles and I experienced a great relief when he was locked in   It was a characteristic feature in this repentance  that I was fain to ask what these two men had done  to be there at all  That appeared to be the last thing about which they had anything to say  I addressed myself to one of the two warders  who  I suspected from certain latent indications in their faces  knew pretty well what all this stir was worth    Do you know   said I  as we walked along the passage   what felony was Number Twenty Seven s last  The answer was that it was a Bank case    A fraud on the Bank of England   I asked   Yes  sir  Fraud  forgery  and conspiracy  He and some others  He set the others on  It was a deep plot for a large sum  Sentence  transportation for life  Twenty Seven was the knowingest bird of the lot  and had very nearly kept himself safe; but not quite  The Bank was just able to put salt upon his tail--and only just     Do you know Twenty Eight s offence     Twenty Eight   returned my informant  speaking throughout in a low tone  and looking over his shoulder as we walked along the passage  to guard himself from being overheard  in such an unlawful reference to these Immaculates  by Creakle and the rest;  Twenty Eight  also transportation  got a place  and robbed a young master of a matter of two hundred and fifty pounds in money and valuables  the night before they were going abroad  I particularly recollect his case  from his being took by a dwarf     A what     A little woman  I have forgot her name     Not Mowcher     That s it! He had eluded pursuit  and was going to America in a flaxen wig  and whiskers  and such a complete disguise as never you see in all your born days; when the little woman  being in Southampton  met him walking along the street--picked him out with her sharp eye in a moment--ran betwixt his legs to upset him--and held on to him like grim Death     Excellent Miss Mowcher!  cried I    You d have said so  if you had seen her  standing on a chair in the witness-box at the trial  as I did   said my friend   He cut her face right open  and pounded her in the most brutal manner  when she took him; but she never loosed her hold till he was locked up  She held so tight to him  in fact  that the officers were obliged to take  em both together  She gave her evidence in the gamest way  and was highly complimented by the Bench  and cheered right home to her lodgings  She said in Court that she d have took him single-handed  on account of what she knew concerning him   if he had been Samson  And it s my belief she would!   It was mine too  and I highly respected Miss Mowcher for it   We had now seen all there was to see  It would have been in vain to represent to such a man as the Worshipful Mr  Creakle  that Twenty Seven and Twenty Eight were perfectly consistent and unchanged; that exactly what they were then  they had always been; that the hypocritical knaves were just the subjects to make that sort of profession in such a place; that they knew its market-value at least as well as we did  in the immediate service it would do them when they were expatriated; in a word  that it was a rotten  hollow  painfully suggestive piece of business altogether  We left them to their system and themselves  and went home wondering    Perhaps it s a good thing  Traddles   said I   to have an unsound Hobby ridden hard; for it s the sooner ridden to death     I hope so   replied Traddles     CHAPTER 62  A LIGHT SHINES ON MY WAY   The year came round to Christmas-time  and I had been at home above two months  I had seen Agnes frequently  However loud the general voice might be in giving me encouragement  and however fervent the emotions and endeavours to which it roused me  I heard her lightest word of praise as I heard nothing else   At least once a week  and sometimes oftener  I rode over there  and passed the evening  I usually rode back at night; for the old unhappy sense was always hovering about me now--most sorrowfully when I left her--and I was glad to be up and out  rather than wandering over the past in weary wakefulness or miserable dreams  I wore away the longest part of many wild sad nights  in those rides; reviving  as I went  the thoughts that had occupied me in my long absence   Or  if I were to say rather that I listened to the echoes of those thoughts  I should better express the truth  They spoke to me from afar off  I had put them at a distance  and accepted my inevitable place  When I read to Agnes what I wrote; when I saw her listening face; moved her to smiles or tears; and heard her cordial voice so earnest on the shadowy events of that imaginative world in which I lived; I thought what a fate mine might have been--but only thought so  as I had thought after I was married to Dora  what I could have wished my wife to be   My duty to Agnes  who loved me with a love  which  if I disquieted  I wronged most selfishly and poorly  and could never restore; my matured assurance that I  who had worked out my own destiny  and won what I had impetuously set my heart on  had no right to murmur  and must bear; comprised what I felt and what I had learned  But I loved her: and now it even became some consolation to me  vaguely to conceive a distant day when I might blamelessly avow it; when all this should be over; when I could say  Agnes  so it was when I came home; and now I am old  and I never have loved since!   She did not once show me any change in herself  What she always had been to me  she still was; wholly unaltered   Between my aunt and me there had been something  in this connexion  since the night of my return  which I cannot call a restraint  or an avoidance of the subject  so much as an implied understanding that we thought of it together  but did not shape our thoughts into words  When  according to our old custom  we sat before the fire at night  we often fell into this train; as naturally  and as consciously to each other  as if we had unreservedly said so  But we preserved an unbroken silence  I believed that she had read  or partly read  my thoughts that night; and that she fully comprehended why I gave mine no more distinct expression   This Christmas-time being come  and Agnes having reposed no new confidence in me  a doubt that had several times arisen in my mind--whether she could have that perception of the true state of my breast  which restrained her with the apprehension of giving me pain--began to oppress me heavily  If that were so  my sacrifice was nothing; my plainest obligation to her unfulfilled; and every poor action I had shrunk from  I was hourly doing  I resolved to set this right beyond all doubt;--if such a barrier were between us  to break it down at once with a determined hand   It was--what lasting reason have I to remember it!--a cold  harsh  winter day  There had been snow  some hours before; and it lay  not deep  but hard-frozen on the ground  Out at sea  beyond my window  the wind blew ruggedly from the north  I had been thinking of it  sweeping over those mountain wastes of snow in Switzerland  then inaccessible to any human foot; and had been speculating which was the lonelier  those solitary regions  or a deserted ocean    Riding today  Trot   said my aunt  putting her head in at the door    Yes   said I   I am going over to Canterbury  It s a good day for a ride     I hope your horse may think so too   said my aunt;  but at present he is holding down his head and his ears  standing before the door there  as if he thought his stable preferable    My aunt  I may observe  allowed my horse on the forbidden ground  but had not at all relented towards the donkeys    He will be fresh enough  presently!  said I    The ride will do his master good  at all events   observed my aunt  glancing at the papers on my table   Ah  child  you pass a good many hours here! I never thought  when I used to read books  what work it was to write them     It s work enough to read them  sometimes   I returned   As to the writing  it has its own charms  aunt     Ah! I see!  said my aunt   Ambition  love of approbation  sympathy  and much more  I suppose  Well: go along with you!    Do you know anything more   said I  standing composedly before her--she had patted me on the shoulder  and sat down in my chair-- of that attachment of Agnes    She looked up in my face a little while  before replying:   I think I do  Trot     Are you confirmed in your impression   I inquired    I think I am  Trot    She looked so steadfastly at me: with a kind of doubt  or pity  or suspense in her affection: that I summoned the stronger determination to show her a perfectly cheerful face    And what is more  Trot--  said my aunt    Yes!    I think Agnes is going to be married     God bless her!  said I  cheerfully    God bless her!  said my aunt   and her husband too!   I echoed it  parted from my aunt  and went lightly downstairs  mounted  and rode away  There was greater reason than before to do what I had resolved to do   How well I recollect the wintry ride! The frozen particles of ice  brushed from the blades of grass by the wind  and borne across my face; the hard clatter of the horse s hoofs  beating a tune upon the ground; the stiff-tilled soil; the snowdrift  lightly eddying in the chalk-pit as the breeze ruffled it; the smoking team with the waggon of old hay  stopping to breathe on the hill-top  and shaking their bells musically; the whitened slopes and sweeps of Down-land lying against the dark sky  as if they were drawn on a huge slate!  I found Agnes alone  The little girls had gone to their own homes now  and she was alone by the fire  reading  She put down her book on seeing me come in; and having welcomed me as usual  took her work-basket and sat in one of the old-fashioned windows   I sat beside her on the window-seat  and we talked of what I was doing  and when it would be done  and of the progress I had made since my last visit  Agnes was very cheerful; and laughingly predicted that I should soon become too famous to be talked to  on such subjects    So I make the most of the present time  you see   said Agnes   and talk to you while I may    As I looked at her beautiful face  observant of her work  she raised her mild clear eyes  and saw that I was looking at her    You are thoughtful today  Trotwood!    Agnes  shall I tell you what about  I came to tell you    She put aside her work  as she was used to do when we were seriously discussing anything; and gave me her whole attention    My dear Agnes  do you doubt my being true to you     No!  she answered  with a look of astonishment    Do you doubt my being what I always have been to you     No!  she answered  as before    Do you remember that I tried to tell you  when I came home  what a debt of gratitude I owed you  dearest Agnes  and how fervently I felt towards you     I remember it   she said  gently   very well     You have a secret   said I   Let me share it  Agnes    She cast down her eyes  and trembled    I could hardly fail to know  even if I had not heard--but from other lips than yours  Agnes  which seems strange--that there is someone upon whom you have bestowed the treasure of your love  Do not shut me out of what concerns your happiness so nearly! If you can trust me  as you say you can  and as I know you may  let me be your friend  your brother  in this matter  of all others!   With an appealing  almost a reproachful  glance  she rose from the window; and hurrying across the room as if without knowing where  put her hands before her face  and burst into such tears as smote me to the heart   And yet they awakened something in me  bringing promise to my heart  Without my knowing why  these tears allied themselves with the quietly sad smile which was so fixed in my remembrance  and shook me more with hope than fear or sorrow    Agnes! Sister! Dearest! What have I done     Let me go away  Trotwood  I am not well  I am not myself  I will speak to you by and by--another time  I will write to you  Don t speak to me now  Don t! don t!   I sought to recollect what she had said  when I had spoken to her on that former night  of her affection needing no return  It seemed a very world that I must search through in a moment   Agnes  I cannot bear to see you so  and think that I have been the cause  My dearest girl  dearer to me than anything in life  if you are unhappy  let me share your unhappiness  If you are in need of help or counsel  let me try to give it to you  If you have indeed a burden on your heart  let me try to lighten it  For whom do I live now  Agnes  if it is not for you!    Oh  spare me! I am not myself! Another time!  was all I could distinguish   Was it a selfish error that was leading me away  Or  having once a clue to hope  was there something opening to me that I had not dared to think of    I must say more  I cannot let you leave me so! For Heaven s sake  Agnes  let us not mistake each other after all these years  and all that has come and gone with them! I must speak plainly  If you have any lingering thought that I could envy the happiness you will confer; that I could not resign you to a dearer protector  of your own choosing; that I could not  from my removed place  be a contented witness of your joy; dismiss it  for I don t deserve it! I have not suffered quite in vain  You have not taught me quite in vain  There is no alloy of self in what I feel for you    She was quiet now  In a little time  she turned her pale face towards me  and said in a low voice  broken here and there  but very clear:   I owe it to your pure friendship for me  Trotwood--which  indeed  I do not doubt--to tell you  you are mistaken  I can do no more  If I have sometimes  in the course of years  wanted help and counsel  they have come to me  If I have sometimes been unhappy  the feeling has passed away  If I have ever had a burden on my heart  it has been lightened for me  If I have any secret  it is--no new one; and is--not what you suppose  I cannot reveal it  or divide it  It has long been mine  and must remain mine     Agnes! Stay! A moment!   She was going away  but I detained her  I clasped my arm about her waist   In the course of years!   It is not a new one!  New thoughts and hopes were whirling through my mind  and all the colours of my life were changing    Dearest Agnes! Whom I so respect and honour--whom I so devotedly love! When I came here today  I thought that nothing could have wrested this confession from me  I thought I could have kept it in my bosom all our lives  till we were old  But  Agnes  if I have indeed any new-born hope that I may ever call you something more than Sister  widely different from Sister!--   Her tears fell fast; but they were not like those she had lately shed  and I saw my hope brighten in them    Agnes! Ever my guide  and best support! If you had been more mindful of yourself  and less of me  when we grew up here together  I think my heedless fancy never would have wandered from you  But you were so much better than I  so necessary to me in every boyish hope and disappointment  that to have you to confide in  and rely upon in everything  became a second nature  supplanting for the time the first and greater one of loving you as I do!   Still weeping  but not sadly--joyfully! And clasped in my arms as she had never been  as I had thought she never was to be!   When I loved Dora--fondly  Agnes  as you know--    Yes!  she cried  earnestly   I am glad to know it!    When I loved her--even then  my love would have been incomplete  without your sympathy  I had it  and it was perfected  And when I lost her  Agnes  what should I have been without you  still!   Closer in my arms  nearer to my heart  her trembling hand upon my shoulder  her sweet eyes shining through her tears  on mine!   I went away  dear Agnes  loving you  I stayed away  loving you  I returned home  loving you!   And now  I tried to tell her of the struggle I had had  and the conclusion I had come to  I tried to lay my mind before her  truly  and entirely  I tried to show her how I had hoped I had come into the better knowledge of myself and of her; how I had resigned myself to what that better knowledge brought; and how I had come there  even that day  in my fidelity to this  If she did so love me  I said  that she could take me for her husband  she could do so  on no deserving of mine  except upon the truth of my love for her  and the trouble in which it had ripened to be what it was; and hence it was that I revealed it  And O  Agnes  even out of thy true eyes  in that same time  the spirit of my child-wife looked upon me  saying it was well; and winning me  through thee  to tenderest recollections of the Blossom that had withered in its bloom!   I am so blest  Trotwood--my heart is so overcharged--but there is one thing I must say     Dearest  what    She laid her gentle hands upon my shoulders  and looked calmly in my face    Do you know  yet  what it is     I am afraid to speculate on what it is  Tell me  my dear     I have loved you all my life!   O  we were happy  we were happy! Our tears were not for the trials  hers so much the greater  through which we had come to be thus  but for the rapture of being thus  never to be divided more!  We walked  that winter evening  in the fields together; and the blessed calm within us seemed to be partaken by the frosty air  The early stars began to shine while we were lingering on  and looking up to them  we thanked our GOD for having guided us to this tranquillity   We stood together in the same old-fashioned window at night  when the moon was shining; Agnes with her quiet eyes raised up to it; I following her glance  Long miles of road then opened out before my mind; and  toiling on  I saw a ragged way-worn boy  forsaken and neglected  who should come to call even the heart now beating against mine  his own    It was nearly dinner-time next day when we appeared before my aunt  She was up in my study  Peggotty said: which it was her pride to keep in readiness and order for me  We found her  in her spectacles  sitting by the fire    Goodness me!  said my aunt  peering through the dusk   who s this you re bringing home     Agnes   said I   As we had arranged to say nothing at first  my aunt was not a little discomfited  She darted a hopeful glance at me  when I said  Agnes ; but seeing that I looked as usual  she took off her spectacles in despair  and rubbed her nose with them   She greeted Agnes heartily  nevertheless; and we were soon in the lighted parlour downstairs  at dinner  My aunt put on her spectacles twice or thrice  to take another look at me  but as often took them off again  disappointed  and rubbed her nose with them  Much to the discomfiture of Mr  Dick  who knew this to be a bad symptom    By the by  aunt   said I  after dinner;  I have been speaking to Agnes about what you told me     Then  Trot   said my aunt  turning scarlet   you did wrong  and broke your promise     You are not angry  aunt  I trust  I am sure you won t be  when you learn that Agnes is not unhappy in any attachment     Stuff and nonsense!  said my aunt   As my aunt appeared to be annoyed  I thought the best way was to cut her annoyance short  I took Agnes in my arm to the back of her chair  and we both leaned over her  My aunt  with one clap of her hands  and one look through her spectacles  immediately went into hysterics  for the first and only time in all my knowledge of her   The hysterics called up Peggotty  The moment my aunt was restored  she flew at Peggotty  and calling her a silly old creature  hugged her with all her might  After that  she hugged Mr  Dick  who was highly honoured  but a good deal surprised ; and after that  told them why  Then  we were all happy together   I could not discover whether my aunt  in her last short conversation with me  had fallen on a pious fraud  or had really mistaken the state of my mind  It was quite enough  she said  that she had told me Agnes was going to be married; and that I now knew better than anyone how true it was    We were married within a fortnight  Traddles and Sophy  and Doctor and Mrs  Strong  were the only guests at our quiet wedding  We left them full of joy; and drove away together  Clasped in my embrace  I held the source of every worthy aspiration I had ever had; the centre of myself  the circle of my life  my own  my wife; my love of whom was founded on a rock!   Dearest husband!  said Agnes   Now that I may call you by that name  I have one thing more to tell you     Let me hear it  love     It grows out of the night when Dora died  She sent you for me     She did     She told me that she left me something  Can you think what it was    I believed I could  I drew the wife who had so long loved me  closer to my side    She told me that she made a last request to me  and left me a last charge     And it was--    That only I would occupy this vacant place    And Agnes laid her head upon my breast  and wept; and I wept with her  though we were so happy      CHAPTER 63  A VISITOR  What I have purposed to record is nearly finished; but there is yet an incident conspicuous in my memory  on which it often rests with delight  and without which one thread in the web I have spun would have a ravelled end   I had advanced in fame and fortune  my domestic joy was perfect  I had been married ten happy years  Agnes and I were sitting by the fire  in our house in London  one night in spring  and three of our children were playing in the room  when I was told that a stranger wished to see me   He had been asked if he came on business  and had answered No; he had come for the pleasure of seeing me  and had come a long way  He was an old man  my servant said  and looked like a farmer   As this sounded mysterious to the children  and moreover was like the beginning of a favourite story Agnes used to tell them  introductory to the arrival of a wicked old Fairy in a cloak who hated everybody  it produced some commotion  One of our boys laid his head in his mother s lap to be out of harm s way  and little Agnes  our eldest child  left her doll in a chair to represent her  and thrust out her little heap of golden curls from between the window-curtains  to see what happened next    Let him come in here!  said I   There soon appeared  pausing in the dark doorway as he entered  a hale  grey-haired old man  Little Agnes  attracted by his looks  had run to bring him in  and I had not yet clearly seen his face  when my wife  starting up  cried out to me  in a pleased and agitated voice  that it was Mr  Peggotty!  It WAS Mr  Peggotty  An old man now  but in a ruddy  hearty  strong old age  When our first emotion was over  and he sat before the fire with the children on his knees  and the blaze shining on his face  he looked  to me  as vigorous and robust  withal as handsome  an old man  as ever I had seen    Mas r Davy   said he  And the old name in the old tone fell so naturally on my ear!  Mas r Davy   tis a joyful hour as I see you  once more   long with your own trew wife!    A joyful hour indeed  old friend!  cried I    And these heer pretty ones   said Mr  Peggotty   To look at these heer flowers! Why  Mas r Davy  you was but the heighth of the littlest of these  when I first see you! When Em ly warn t no bigger  and our poor lad were BUT a lad!    Time has changed me more than it has changed you since then   said I   But let these dear rogues go to bed; and as no house in England but this must hold you  tell me where to send for your luggage  is the old black bag among it  that went so far  I wonder!   and then  over a glass of Yarmouth grog  we will have the tidings of ten years!    Are you alone   asked Agnes    Yes  ma am   he said  kissing her hand   quite alone    We sat him between us  not knowing how to give him welcome enough; and as I began to listen to his old familiar voice  I could have fancied he was still pursuing his long journey in search of his darling niece    It s a mort of water   said Mr  Peggotty   fur to come across  and on y stay a matter of fower weeks  But water   specially when  tis salt  comes nat ral to me; and friends is dear  and I am heer  --Which is verse   said Mr  Peggotty  surprised to find it out   though I hadn t such intentions     Are you going back those many thousand miles  so soon   asked Agnes    Yes  ma am   he returned   I giv the promise to Em ly  afore I come away  You see  I doen t grow younger as the years comes round  and if I hadn t sailed as  twas  most like I shouldn t never have done  t  And it s allus been on my mind  as I must come and see Mas r Davy and your own sweet blooming self  in your wedded happiness  afore I got to be too old    He looked at us  as if he could never feast his eyes on us sufficiently  Agnes laughingly put back some scattered locks of his grey hair  that he might see us better    And now tell us   said I   everything relating to your fortunes     Our fortuns  Mas r Davy   he rejoined   is soon told  We haven t fared nohows  but fared to thrive  We ve allus thrived  We ve worked as we ought to  t  and maybe we lived a leetle hard at first or so  but we have allus thrived  What with sheep-farming  and what with stock-farming  and what with one thing and what with t other  we are as well to do  as well could be  Theer s been kiender a blessing fell upon us   said Mr  Peggotty  reverentially inclining his head   and we ve done nowt but prosper  That is  in the long run  If not yesterday  why then today  If not today  why then tomorrow     And Emily   said Agnes and I  both together    Em ly   said he   arter you left her  ma am--and I never heerd her saying of her prayers at night  t other side the canvas screen  when we was settled in the Bush  but what I heerd your name--and arter she and me lost sight of Mas r Davy  that theer shining sundown--was that low  at first  that  if she had know d then what Mas r Davy kep from us so kind and thowtful   tis my opinion she d have drooped away  But theer was some poor folks aboard as had illness among  em  and she took care of them; and theer was the children in our company  and she took care of them; and so she got to be busy  and to be doing good  and that helped her     When did she first hear of it   I asked    I kep it from her arter I heerd on  t   said Mr  Peggotty   going on nigh a year  We was living then in a solitary place  but among the beautifullest trees  and with the roses a-covering our Beein to the roof  Theer come along one day  when I was out a-working on the land  a traveller from our own Norfolk or Suffolk in England  I doen t rightly mind which   and of course we took him in  and giv him to eat and drink  and made him welcome  We all do that  all the colony over  He d got an old newspaper with him  and some other account in print of the storm  That s how she know d it  When I came home at night  I found she know d it    He dropped his voice as he said these words  and the gravity I so well remembered overspread his face    Did it change her much   we asked    Aye  for a good long time   he said  shaking his head;  if not to this present hour  But I think the solitoode done her good  And she had a deal to mind in the way of poultry and the like  and minded of it  and come through  I wonder   he said thoughtfully   if you could see my Em ly now  Mas r Davy  whether you d know her!    Is she so altered   I inquired    I doen t know  I see her ev ry day  and doen t know; But  odd-times  I have thowt so  A slight figure   said Mr  Peggotty  looking at the fire   kiender worn; soft  sorrowful  blue eyes; a delicate face; a pritty head  leaning a little down; a quiet voice and way--timid a most  That s Em ly!   We silently observed him as he sat  still looking at the fire    Some thinks   he said   as her affection was ill-bestowed; some  as her marriage was broken off by death  No one knows how  tis  She might have married well  a mort of times   she says to me  
fond of going any distance fur to teach a child  or fur to tend a sick person  or fur to do some kindness tow rds a young girl s wedding  and she s done a many  but has never seen one ; fondly loving of her uncle; patient; liked by young and old; sowt out by all that has any trouble  That s Em ly!   He drew his hand across his face  and with a half-suppressed sigh looked up from the fire    Is Martha with you yet   I asked    Martha   he replied   got married  Mas r Davy  in the second year  A young man  a farm-labourer  as come by us on his way to market with his mas r s drays--a journey of over five hundred mile  theer and back--made offers fur to take her fur his wife  wives is very scarce theer   and then to set up fur their two selves in the Bush  She spoke to me fur to tell him her trew story  I did  They was married  and they live fower hundred mile away from any voices but their own and the singing birds     Mrs  Gummidge   I suggested   It was a pleasant key to touch  for Mr  Peggotty suddenly burst into a roar of laughter  and rubbed his hands up and down his legs  as he had been accustomed to do when he enjoyed himself in the long-shipwrecked boat    Would you believe it!  he said   Why  someun even made offer fur to marry her! If a ship s cook that was turning settler  Mas r Davy  didn t make offers fur to marry Missis Gummidge  I m Gormed--and I can t say no fairer than that!   I never saw Agnes laugh so  This sudden ecstasy on the part of Mr  Peggotty was so delightful to her  that she could not leave off laughing; and the more she laughed the more she made me laugh  and the greater Mr  Peggotty s ecstasy became  and the more he rubbed his legs    And what did Mrs  Gummidge say   I asked  when I was grave enough    If you ll believe me   returned Mr  Peggotty   Missis Gummidge   stead of saying standing by  and laid it over that theer ship s cook s head  till he sung out fur help  and I went in and reskied of him    Mr  Peggotty burst into a great roar of laughter  and Agnes and I both kept him company    But I must say this  for the good creetur   he resumed  wiping his face  when we were quite exhausted;  she has been all she said she d be to us  and more  She s the willingest  the trewest  the honestest-helping woman  Mas r Davy  as ever draw d the breath of life  I have never know d her to be lone and lorn  for a single minute  not even when the colony was all afore us  and we was new to it  And thinking of the old  un is a thing she never done  I do assure you  since she left England!    Now  last  not least  Mr  Micawber   said I   He has paid off every obligation he incurred here--even to Traddles s bill  you remember my dear Agnes--and therefore we may take it for granted that he is doing well  But what is the latest news of him    Mr  Peggotty  with a smile  put his hand in his breast-pocket  and produced a flat-folded  paper parcel  from which he took out  with much care  a little odd-looking newspaper    You are to understan   Mas r Davy   said he   as we have left the Bush now  being so well to do; and have gone right away round to Port Middlebay Harbour  wheer theer s what we call a town     Mr  Micawber was in the Bush near you   said I    Bless you  yes   said Mr  Peggotty   and turned to with a will  I never wish to meet a better gen l man for turning to with a will  I ve seen that theer bald head of his a perspiring in the sun  Mas r Davy  till I a most thowt it would have melted away  And now he s a Magistrate     A Magistrate  eh   said I   Mr  Peggotty pointed to a certain paragraph in the newspaper  where I read aloud as follows  from the Port Middlebay Times:    The public dinner to our distinguished fellow-colonist and townsman  WILKINS MICAWBER  ESQUIRE  Port Middlebay District Magistrate  came off yesterday in the large room of the Hotel  which was crowded to suffocation  It is estimated that not fewer than forty-seven persons must have been accommodated with dinner at one time  exclusive of the company in the passage and on the stairs  The beauty  fashion  and exclusiveness of Port Middlebay  flocked to do honour to one so deservedly esteemed  so highly talented  and so widely popular  Doctor Mell  of Colonial Salem-House Grammar School  Port Middlebay  presided  and on his right sat the distinguished guest  After the removal of the cloth  and the singing of Non Nobis  beautifully executed  and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the bell-like notes of that gifted amateur  WILKINS MICAWBER  ESQUIRE  JUNIOR   the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received  Doctor Mell  in a speech replete with feeling  then proposed defies description  Again and again it rose and fell  like the waves of ocean  At length all was hushed  and WILKINS MICAWBER  ESQUIRE  presented himself to return thanks  Far be it from us  in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment  to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothly-flowing periods of his polished and highly-ornate address! Suffice it to observe  that it was a masterpiece of eloquence; and that those passages in which he more particularly traced his own successful career to its source  and warned the younger portion of his auditory from the shoals of ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they were unable to liquidate  brought a tear into the manliest eye present  The remaining toasts were DOCTOR MELL; Mrs  MICAWBER  who gracefully bowed her acknowledgements from the side-door  where a galaxy of beauty was elevated on chairs  at once to witness and adorn the gratifying scene   Mrs  RIDGER BEGS  late Miss Micawber ; Mrs  MELL; WILKINS MICAWBER  ESQUIRE  JUNIOR  who convulsed the assembly by humorously remarking that he found himself unable to return thanks in a speech  but would do so  with their permission  in a song ; Mrs  MICAWBER S FAMILY  well known  it is needless to remark  in the mother-country   &c  &c  &c  At the conclusion of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by art-magic for dancing  Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE  who disported themselves until Sol gave warning for departure  Wilkins Micawber  Esquire  Junior  and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena  fourth daughter of Doctor Mell  were particularly remarkable     I was looking back to the name of Doctor Mell  pleased to have discovered  in these happier circumstances  Mr  Mell  formerly poor pinched usher to my Middlesex magistrate  when Mr  Peggotty pointing to another part of the paper  my eyes rested on my own name  and I read thus:    TO DAVID COPPERFIELD  ESQUIRE    THE EMINENT AUTHOR    My Dear Sir    Years have elapsed  since I had an opportunity of ocularly perusing the lineaments  now familiar to the imaginations of a considerable portion of the civilized world    But  my dear Sir  though estranged  by the force of circumstances over which I have had no control  from the personal society of the friend and companion of my youth  I have not been unmindful of his soaring flight  Nor have I been debarred        Though seas between us braid ha  roared    BURNS  from participating in the intellectual feasts he has spread before us    I cannot  therefore  allow of the departure from this place of an individual whom we mutually respect and esteem  without  my dear Sir  taking this public opportunity of thanking you  on my own behalf  and  I may undertake to add  on that of the whole of the Inhabitants of Port Middlebay  for the gratification of which you are the ministering agent    Go on  my dear Sir! You are not unknown here  you are not unappreciated  Though   we are neither 
  nor  I may add  
course! The inhabitants of Port Middlebay may at least aspire to watch it  with delight  with entertainment  with instruction!   Among the eyes elevated towards you from this portion of the globe  will ever be found  while it has light and life                   The                      Eye                           Appertaining to                                 WILKINS MICAWBER                                      Magistrate     I found  on glancing at the remaining contents of the newspaper  that Mr  Micawber was a diligent and esteemed correspondent of that journal  There was another letter from him in the same paper  touching a bridge; there was an advertisement of a collection of similar letters by him  to be shortly republished  in a neat volume   with considerable additions ; and  unless I am very much mistaken  the Leading Article was his also   We talked much of Mr  Micawber  on many other evenings while Mr  Peggotty remained with us  He lived with us during the whole term of his stay --which  I think  was something less than a month --and his sister and my aunt came to London to see him  Agnes and I parted from him aboard-ship  when he sailed; and we shall never part from him more  on earth   But before he left  he went with me to Yarmouth  to see a little tablet I had put up in the churchyard to the memory of Ham  While I was copying the plain inscription for him at his request  I saw him stoop  and gather a tuft of grass from the grave and a little earth    For Em ly   he said  as he put it in his breast   I promised  Mas r Davy      CHAPTER 64  A LAST RETROSPECT   And now my written story ends  I look back  once more--for the last time--before I close these leaves   I see myself  with Agnes at my side  journeying along the road of life  I see our children and our friends around us; and I hear the roar of many voices  not indifferent to me as I travel on   What faces are the most distinct to me in the fleeting crowd  Lo  these; all turning to me as I ask my thoughts the question!  Here is my aunt  in stronger spectacles  an old woman of four-score years and more  but upright yet  and a steady walker of six miles at a stretch in winter weather   Always with her  here comes Peggotty  my good old nurse  likewise in spectacles  accustomed to do needle-work at night very close to the lamp  but never sitting down to it without a bit of wax candle  a yard-measure in a little house  and a work-box with a picture of St  Paul s upon the lid   The cheeks and arms of Peggotty  so hard and red in my childish days  when I wondered why the birds didn t peck her in preference to apples  are shrivelled now; and her eyes  that used to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face  are fainter  though they glitter still ; but her rough forefinger  which I once associated with a pocket nutmeg-grater  is just the same  and when I see my least child catching at it as it totters from my aunt to her  I think of our little parlour at home  when I could scarcely walk  My aunt s old disappointment is set right  now  She is godmother to a real living Betsey Trotwood; and Dora  the next in order  says she spoils her   There is something bulky in Peggotty s pocket  It is nothing smaller than the Crocodile Book  which is in rather a dilapidated condition by this time  with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across  but which Peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic  I find it very curious to see my own infant face  looking up at me from the Crocodile stories; and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance Brooks of Sheffield   Among my boys  this summer holiday time  I see an old man making giant kites  and gazing at them in the air  with a delight for which there are no words  He greets me rapturously  and whispers  with many nods and winks   Trotwood  you will be glad to hear that I shall finish the Memorial when I have nothing else to do  and that your aunt s the most extraordinary woman in the world  sir!   Who is this bent lady  supporting herself by a stick  and showing me a countenance in which there are some traces of old pride and beauty  feebly contending with a querulous  imbecile  fretful wandering of the mind  She is in a garden; and near her stands a sharp  dark  withered woman  with a white scar on her lip  Let me hear what they say    Rosa  I have forgotten this gentleman s name    Rosa bends over her  and calls to her   Mr  Copperfield     I am glad to see you  sir  I am sorry to observe you are in mourning  I hope Time will be good to you    Her impatient attendant scolds her  tells her I am not in mourning  bids her look again  tries to rouse her    You have seen my son  sir   says the elder lady   Are you reconciled    Looking fixedly at me  she puts her hand to her forehead  and moans  Suddenly  she cries  in a terrible voice   Rosa  come to me  He is dead!  Rosa kneeling at her feet  by turns caresses her  and quarrels with her; now fiercely telling her   I loved him better than you ever did! --now soothing her to sleep on her breast  like a sick child  Thus I leave them; thus I always find them; thus they wear their time away  from year to year   What ship comes sailing home from India  and what English lady is this  married to a growling old Scotch Croesus with great flaps of ears  Can this be Julia Mills   Indeed it is Julia Mills  peevish and fine  with a black man to carry cards and letters to her on a golden salver  and a copper-coloured woman in linen  with a bright handkerchief round her head  to serve her Tiffin in her dressing-room  But Julia keeps no diary in these days; never sings Affection s Dirge; eternally quarrels with the old Scotch Croesus  who is a sort of yellow bear with a tanned hide  Julia is steeped in money to the throat  and talks and thinks of nothing else  I liked her better in the Desert of Sahara   Or perhaps this IS the Desert of Sahara! For  though Julia has a stately house  and mighty company  and sumptuous dinners every day  I see no green growth near her; nothing that can ever come to fruit or flower  What Julia calls  society   I see; among it Mr  Jack Maldon  from his Patent Place  sneering at the hand that gave it him  and speaking to me of the Doctor as  so charmingly antique   But when society is the name for such hollow gentlemen and ladies  Julia  and when its breeding is professed indifference to everything that can advance or can retard mankind  I think we must have lost ourselves in that same Desert of Sahara  and had better find the way out   And lo  the Doctor  always our good friend  labouring at his Dictionary  somewhere about the letter D   and happy in his home and wife  Also the Old Soldier  on a considerably reduced footing  and by no means so influential as in days of yore!  Working at his chambers in the Temple  with a busy aspect  and his hair  where he is not bald  made more rebellious than ever by the constant friction of his lawyer s-wig  I come  in a later time  upon my dear old Traddles  His table is covered with thick piles of papers; and I say  as I look around me:   If Sophy were your clerk  now  Traddles  she would have enough to do!    You may say that  my dear Copperfield! But those were capital days  too  in Holborn Court! Were they not     When she told you you would be a judge  But it was not the town talk then!    At all events   says Traddles   if I ever am one--   Why  you know you will be     Well  my dear Copperfield  WHEN I am one  I shall tell the story  as I said I would    We walk away  arm in arm  I am going to have a family dinner with Traddles  It is Sophy s birthday; and  on our road  Traddles discourses to me of the good fortune he has enjoyed    I really have been able  my dear Copperfield  to do all that I had most at heart  There s the Reverend Horace promoted to that living at four hundred and fifty pounds a year; there are our two boys receiving the very best education  and distinguishing themselves as steady scholars and good fellows; there are three of the girls married very comfortably; there are three more living with us; there are three more keeping house for the Reverend Horace since Mrs  Crewler s decease; and all of them happy     Except--  I suggest    Except the Beauty   says Traddles   Yes  It was very unfortunate that she should marry such a vagabond  But there was a certain dash and glare about him that caught her  However  now we have got her safe at our house  and got rid of him  we must cheer her up again    Traddles s house is one of the very houses--or it easily may have been--which he and Sophy used to parcel out  in their evening walks  It is a large house; but Traddles keeps his papers in his dressing-room and his boots with his papers; and he and Sophy squeeze themselves into upper rooms  reserving the best bedrooms for the Beauty and the girls  There is no room to spare in the house; for more of  the girls  are here  and always are here  by some accident or other  than I know how to count  Here  when we go in  is a crowd of them  running down to the door  and handing Traddles about to be kissed  until he is out of breath  Here  established in perpetuity  is the poor Beauty  a widow with a little girl; here  at dinner on Sophy s birthday  are the three married girls with their three husbands  and one of the husband s brothers  and another husband s cousin  and another husband s sister  who appears to me to be engaged to the cousin  Traddles  exactly the same simple  unaffected fellow as he ever was  sits at the foot of the large table like a Patriarch; and Sophy beams upon him  from the head  across a cheerful space that is certainly not glittering with Britannia metal   And now  as I close my task  subduing my desire to linger yet  these faces fade away  But one face  shining on me like a Heavenly light by which I see all other objects  is above them and beyond them all  And that remains   I turn my head  and see it  in its beautiful serenity  beside me   My lamp burns low  and I have written far into the night; but the dear presence  without which I were nothing  bears me company   O Agnes  O my soul  so may thy face be by me when I close my life indeed; so may I  when realities are melting from me  like the shadows which I now dismiss  still find thee near me  pointing upward!  
_BOOKEND_
My dear Mr  Bennet 
have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last 
But it is 
for Mrs  Long has just been here  and she told me all about it 
Do you not want to know who has taken it 
You want to tell me  and I have no objection to hearing it 
Why  my dear  you must know  Mrs  Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place  and was so much delighted with it  that he agreed with Mr  Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas  and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week 
What is his name 
Bingley 
Is he married or single 
Oh! Single  my dear  to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year  What a fine thing for our girls!
How so  How can it affect them 
My dear Mr  Bennet 
how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them 
Is that his design in settling here 
Design! Nonsense  how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them  and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes 
I see no occasion for that  You and the girls may go  or you may send them by themselves  which perhaps will be still better  for as you are as handsome as any of them  Mr  Bingley may like you the best of the party 
My dear  you flatter me  I certainly have had my share of beauty  but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now  When a woman has five grown-up daughters  she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty 
In such cases  a woman has not often much beauty to think of 
But  my dear  you must indeed go and see Mr  Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood 
It is more than I engage for  I assure you 
But consider your daughters  Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them  Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go  merely on that account  for in general  you know  they visit no newcomers  Indeed you must go  for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not 
You are over-scrupulous  surely  I dare say Mr  Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy 
I desire you will do no such thing  Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane  nor half so good-humoured as Lydia  But you are always giving her the preference 
They have none of them much to recommend them 
they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters 
Mr  Bennet  how can you abuse your own children in such a way  You take delight in vexing me  You have no compassion for my poor nerves 
You mistake me  my dear  I have a high respect for your nerves  They are my old friends  I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least 
Ah  you do not know what I suffer 
But I hope you will get over it  and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood 
It will be no use to us  if twenty such should come  since you will not visit them 
Depend upon it  my dear  that when there are twenty  I will visit them all 
I hope Mr  Bingley will like it  Lizzy 
We are not in a way to know what Mr  Bingley likes 
since we are not to visit 
But you forget  mamma 
that we shall meet him at the assemblies  and that Mrs  Long promised to introduce him 
I do not believe Mrs  Long will do any such thing  She has two nieces of her own  She is a selfish  hypocritical woman  and I have no opinion of her 
No more have I 
and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you 
Don t keep coughing so  Kitty  for Heaven s sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves  You tear them to pieces 
Kitty has no discretion in her coughs 
she times them ill 
I do not cough for my own amusement 
When is your next ball to be  Lizzy 
To-morrow fortnight 
Aye  so it is 
and Mrs  Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him  for she will not know him herself 
Then  my dear  you may have the advantage of your friend  and introduce Mr  Bingley to her 
Impossible  Mr  Bennet  impossible  when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing 
I honour your circumspection  A fortnight s acquaintance is certainly very little  One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight  But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all  Mrs  Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and  therefore  as she will think it an act of kindness  if you decline the office  I will take it on myself 
Nonsense  nonsense!
What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation 
Do you consider the forms of introduction  and the stress that is laid on them  as nonsense  I cannot quite agree with you there  What say you  Mary  For you are a young lady of deep reflection  I know  and read great books and make extracts 
While Mary is adjusting her ideas 
let us return to Mr  Bingley 
I am sick of Mr  Bingley 
I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before  If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him  It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit  we cannot escape the acquaintance now 
How good it was in you  my dear Mr  Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last  I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance  Well  how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke  too  that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now 
Now  Kitty  you may cough as much as you choose 
What an excellent father you have  girls!
I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me  either  for that matter  At our time of life it is not so pleasant  I can tell you  to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes  we would do anything  Lydia  my love  though you are the youngest  I dare say Mr  Bingley will dance with you at the next ball 
Oh!
I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest  I m the tallest 
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield 
and all the others equally well married  I shall have nothing to wish for 
Come  Darcy 
I must have you dance  I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner  You had much better dance 
I certainly shall not  You know how I detest it  unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner  At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable  Your sisters are engaged  and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with 
I would not be so fastidious as you are 
for a kingdom! Upon my honour  I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty 
You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room 
Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you  who is very pretty  and I dare say very agreeable  Do let me ask my partner to introduce you 
Which do you mean 
She is tolerable  but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men  You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles  for you are wasting your time with me 
Oh! my dear Mr  Bennet 
we have had a most delightful evening  a most excellent ball  I wish you had been there  Jane was so admired  nothing could be like it  Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr  Bingley thought her quite beautiful  and danced with her twice! Only think of that  my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time  First of all  he asked Miss Lucas  I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But  however  he did not admire her at all; indeed  nobody can  you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance  So he inquired who she was  and got introduced  and asked her for the two next  Then the two third he danced with Miss King  and the two fourth with Maria Lucas  and the two fifth with Jane again  and the two sixth with Lizzy  and the Boulanger—
If he had had any compassion for me 
he would not have danced half so much! For God s sake  say no more of his partners  Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!
Oh! my dear  I am quite delighted with him  He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women  I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses  I dare say the lace upon Mrs  Hurst s gown—
But I can assure you 
that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable  horrid man  not at all worth pleasing  So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here  and he walked there  fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there  my dear  to have given him one of your set-downs  I quite detest the man 
He is just what a young man ought to be 
sensible  good-humoured  lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease  with such perfect good breeding!
He is also handsome 
which a young man ought likewise to be  if he possibly can  His character is thereby complete 
I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time  I did not expect such a compliment 
Did not you  I did for you  But that is one great difference between us  Compliments always take you by surprise  and me never  What could be more natural than his asking you again  He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room  No thanks to his gallantry for that  Well  he certainly is very agreeable  and I give you leave to like him  You have liked many a stupider person 
Dear Lizzy!
Oh! you are a great deal too apt  you know  to like people in general  You never see a fault in anybody  All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes  I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life 
I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think 
I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder  With your good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere  But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of everybody s character and make it still better  and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone  And so you like this man s sisters  too  do you  Their manners are not equal to his 
Certainly not—at first  But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them  Miss Bingley is to live with her brother  and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her 
You began the evening well  Charlotte 
You were Mr  Bingley s first choice 
Yes; but he seemed to like his second better 
Oh! you mean Jane  I suppose  because he danced with her twice  To be sure that did seem as if he admired her—indeed I rather believe he did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about Mr  Robinson 
Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr  Robinson; did not I mention it to you  Mr  Robinson s asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies  and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room  and which he thought the prettiest  and his answering immediately to the last question:  Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet  beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point  
Upon my word! Well  that is very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but  however  it may all come to nothing  you know 
My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours  Eliza 
Mr  Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend  is he —poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable 
I beg you would not put it into Lizzy s head to be vexed by his ill-treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man  that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him  Mrs  Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips 
Are you quite sure  ma am —is not there a little mistake 
I certainly saw Mr  Darcy speaking to her 
Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield  and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to 
Miss Bingley told me 
that he never speaks much  unless among his intimate acquaintances  With them he is remarkably agreeable 
I do not believe a word of it  my dear  If he had been so very agreeable  he would have talked to Mrs  Long  But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride  and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs  Long does not keep a carriage  and had come to the ball in a hack chaise 
I do not mind his not talking to Mrs  Long 
but I wish he had danced with Eliza 
Another time  Lizzy 
I would not dance with him  if I were you 
I believe  ma am  I may safely promise you never to dance with him 
His pride 
does not offend me so much as pride often does  because there is an excuse for it  One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man  with family  fortune  everything in his favour  should think highly of himself  If I may so express it  he has a right to be proud 
That is very true 
and I could easily forgive his pride  if he had not mortified mine 
Pride 
is a very common failing  I believe  By all that I have ever read  I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it  and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other  real or imaginary  Vanity and pride are different things  though the words are often used synonymously  A person may be proud without being vain  Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves  vanity to what we would have others think of us 
If I were as rich as Mr  Darcy 
I should not care how proud I was  I would keep a pack of foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine a day 
Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought 
and if I were to see you at it  I should take away your bottle directly 
It may perhaps be pleasant 
to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded  If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it  she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark  There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment  that it is not safe to leave any to itself  We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement  In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels  Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her  if she does not help him on 
But she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow  If I can perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton  indeed  not to discover it too 
Remember  Eliza  that he does not know Jane s disposition as you do 
But if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to conceal it  he must find it out 
Perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her  But  though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours together; and  as they always see each other in large mixed parties  it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together  Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention  When she is secure of him  there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses 
Your plan is a good one 
where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married  and if I were determined to get a rich husband  or any husband  I dare say I should adopt it  But these are not Jane s feelings; she is not acting by design  As yet  she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness  She has known him only a fortnight  She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house  and has since dined with him in company four times  This is not quite enough to make her understand his character 
Not as you represent it  Had she merely dined with him  she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal 
Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic  I do not imagine that much has been unfolded 
Well 
I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow  I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth  Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance  If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand  it does not advance their felicity in the least  They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life 
You make me laugh  Charlotte; but it is not sound  You know it is not sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself 
What does Mr  Darcy mean 
by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster 
That is a question which Mr  Darcy only can answer 
But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about  He has a very satirical eye  and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself  I shall soon grow afraid of him 
Did you not think  Mr  Darcy  that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now  when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton 
With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic 
You are severe on us 
It will be her turn soon to be teased 
I am going to open the instrument  Eliza  and you know what follows 
You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn  you would have been invaluable; but as it is  I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers 
Very well  if it must be so  it must 
There is a fine old saying  which everybody here is of course familiar with:  Keep your breath to cool your porridge ; and I shall keep mine to swell my song 
What a charming amusement for young people this is  Mr  Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all  I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society 
Certainly  sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world  Every savage can dance 
Your friend performs delightfully 
and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself  Mr  Darcy 
You saw me dance at Meryton  I believe  sir 
Yes  indeed  and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight  Do you often dance at St  James s 
Never  sir 
Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place 
It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it 
You have a house in town  I conclude 
I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas 
My dear Miss Eliza  why are you not dancing  Mr  Darcy  you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner  You cannot refuse to dance  I am sure when so much beauty is before you 
Indeed  sir  I have not the least intention of dancing  I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner 
You excel so much in the dance  Miss Eliza  that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general  he can have no objection  I am sure  to oblige us for one half-hour 
Mr  Darcy is all politeness 
He is  indeed; but  considering the inducement  my dear Miss Eliza  we cannot wonder at his complaisance—for who would object to such a partner 
I can guess the subject of your reverie 
I should imagine not 
You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion  I was never more annoyed! The insipidity  and yet the noise—the nothingness  and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!
Your conjecture is totally wrong  I assure you  My mind was more agreeably engaged  I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow 
Miss Elizabeth Bennet 
Miss Elizabeth Bennet!
I am all astonishment  How long has she been such a favourite —and pray  when am I to wish you joy 
That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask  A lady s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love  from love to matrimony  in a moment  I knew you would be wishing me joy 
Nay  if you are serious about it  I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled  You will be having a charming mother-in-law  indeed; and  of course  she will always be at Pemberley with you 
From all that I can collect by your manner of talking  you must be two of the silliest girls in the country  I have suspected it some time  but I am now convinced 
I am astonished  my dear 
that you should be so ready to think your own children silly  If I wished to think slightingly of anybody s children  it should not be of my own  however 
If my children are silly  I must hope to be always sensible of it 
Yes—but as it happens  they are all of them very clever 
This is the only point  I flatter myself  on which we do not agree  I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular  but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish 
My dear Mr  Bennet  you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother  When they get to our age  I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do  I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and  indeed  so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel  with five or six thousand a year  should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William s in his regimentals 
Mamma 
my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke s library 
Well  Jane  who is it from  What is it about  What does he say  Well  Jane  make haste and tell us; make haste  my love 
It is from Miss Bingley 
 CAROLINE BINGLEY
With the officers!
I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that 
Dining out 
that is very unlucky 
Can I have the carriage 
No  my dear  you had better go on horseback  because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night 
That would be a good scheme 
if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home 
Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr  Bingley s chaise to go to Meryton  and the Hursts have no horses to theirs 
I had much rather go in the coach 
But  my dear  your father cannot spare the horses  I am sure  They are wanted in the farm  Mr  Bennet  are they not 
They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them 
But if you have got them to-day 
my mother s purpose will be answered 
This was a lucky idea of mine  indeed!
   said Mr  Bennet  when Elizabeth had read the note aloud  
  Elizabeth  feeling really anxious  was determined to go to her  though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman  walking was her only alternative  She declared her resolution    cried her mother  
   said her father  
   observed Mary  
   said Lydia  as they walked along  
 In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers  wives  and Elizabeth continued her walk alone  crossing field after field at a quick pace  jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity  and finding herself at last within view of the house  with weary ankles  dirty stockings  and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise   She was shown into the breakfast-parlour  where all but Jane were assembled  and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise  That she should have walked three miles so early in the day  in such dirty weather  and by herself  was almost incredible to Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it  She was received  however  very politely by them; and in their brother s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness  Mr  Darcy said very little  and Mr  Hurst nothing at all  The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion  and doubt as to the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone  The latter was thinking only of his breakfast   Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered  Miss Bennet had slept ill  and though up  was very feverish  and not well enough to leave her room  Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane  who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit  was delighted at her entrance  She was not equal  however  to much conversation  and when Miss Bingley left them together  could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with  Elizabeth silently attended her   When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself  when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane  The apothecary came  and having examined his patient  said  as might be supposed  that she had caught a violent cold  and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed  and promised her some draughts  The advice was followed readily  for the feverish symptoms increased  and her head ached acutely  Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out  they had  in fact  nothing to do elsewhere   When the clock struck three  Elizabeth felt that she must go  and very unwillingly said so  Miss Bingley offered her the carriage  and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it  when Jane testified such concern in parting with her  that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present  Elizabeth most thankfully consented  and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes       Chapter 8  At five o clock the two ladies retired to dress  and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner  To the civil inquiries which then poured in  and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr  Bingley s  she could not make a very favourable answer  Jane was by no means better  The sisters  on hearing this  repeated three or four times how much they were grieved  how shocking it was to have a bad cold  and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike   Their brother  indeed  was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency  His anxiety for Jane was evident  and his attentions to herself most pleasing  and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others  She had very little notice from any but him  Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr  Darcy  her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr  Hurst  by whom Elizabeth sat  he was an indolent man  who lived only to eat  drink  and play at cards; who  when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout  had nothing to say to her   When dinner was over  she returned directly to Jane  and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room  Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed  a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation  no style  no beauty  Mrs  Hurst thought the same  and added:      said Bingley; 
  said Miss Bingley; 
     observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper  
  he replied; 
      cried Bingley  
  To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend s vulgar relations   With a renewal of tenderness  however  they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour  and sat with her till summoned to coffee  She was still very poorly  and Elizabeth would not quit her at all  till late in the evening  when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep  and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself  On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo  and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it  and making her sister the excuse  said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below  with a book  Mr  Hurst looked at her with astonishment    said he; 
  said Miss Bingley  
  cried Elizabeth; 
  said Bingley; 
 Elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying  He immediately offered to fetch her others—all that his library afforded    Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room    said Miss Bingley  
  he replied  
         Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed  as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside  she drew near the card-table  and stationed herself between Mr  Bingley and his eldest sister  to observe the game    said Miss Bingley; 
    said Bingley  
    said Darcy  
   observed Elizabeth  
   cried his faithful assistant  
  added Darcy  
    Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description  when Mr  Hurst called them to order  with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward  As all conversation was thereby at an end  Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room    said Miss Bingley  when the door was closed on her  
  replied Darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly addressed  
 Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject   Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse  and that she could not leave her  Bingley urged Mr  Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters  convinced that no country advice could be of any service  recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians  This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal; and it was settled that Mr  Jones should be sent for early in the morning  if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better  Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable  They solaced their wretchedness  however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister       Chapter 9  Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room  and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr  Bingley by a housemaid  and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters  In spite of this amendment  however  she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn  desiring her mother to visit Jane  and form her own judgement of her situation  The note was immediately dispatched  and its contents as quickly complied with  Mrs  Bennet  accompanied by her two youngest girls  reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast   Had she found Jane in any apparent danger  Mrs  Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering immediately  as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield  She would not listen  therefore  to her daughter s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think it at all advisable  After sitting a little while with Jane  on Miss Bingley s appearance and invitation  the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour  Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs  Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected    was her answer  
  cried Bingley  
  said Miss Bingley  with cold civility  
 Mrs  Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments    she added  
  replied he; 
       cried her mother  
  continued Bingley immediately  
   said Darcy  
   cried Mrs  Bennet  offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood  
 Everybody was surprised  and Darcy  after looking at her for a moment  turned silently away  Mrs  Bennet  who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him  continued her triumph     he replied  
  looking at Darcy  
  said Elizabeth  blushing for her mother  
  Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance  His sister was less delicate  and directed her eyes towards Mr  Darcy with a very expressive smile  Elizabeth  for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts  now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away         said Elizabeth impatiently  
   Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again  She longed to speak  but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs  Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr  Bingley for his kindness to Jane  with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy  Mr  Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer  and forced his younger sister to be civil also  and say what the occasion required  She performed her part indeed without much graciousness  but Mrs  Bennet was satisfied  and soon afterwards ordered her carriage  Upon this signal  the youngest of her daughters put herself forward  The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit  and the result of it was  that the youngest should tax Mr  Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield   Lydia was a stout  well-grown girl of fifteen  with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother  whose affection had brought her into public at an early age  She had high animal spirits  and a sort of natural self-consequence  which the attention of the officers  to whom her uncle s good dinners  and her own easy manners recommended her  had increased into assurance  She was very equal  therefore  to address Mr  Bingley on the subject of the ball  and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding  that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it  His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother s ear:   Lydia declared herself satisfied   she added  
 Mrs  Bennet and her daughters then departed  and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane  leaving her own and her relations  behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr  Darcy; the latter of whom  however  could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her  in spite of all Miss Bingley s witticisms on fine eyes       Chapter 10  The day passed much as the day before had done  Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid  who continued  though slowly  to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room  The loo-table  however  did not appear  Mr  Darcy was writing  and Miss Bingley  seated near him  was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister  Mr  Hurst and Mr  Bingley were at piquet  and Mrs  Hurst was observing their game   Elizabeth took up some needlework  and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion  The perpetual commendations of the lady  either on his handwriting  or on the evenness of his lines  or on the length of his letter  with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received  formed a curious dialogue  and was exactly in union with her opinion of each    He made no answer            He was silent         cried her brother  
   cried Miss Bingley  
   said Elizabeth  
  said Darcy  
    cried Bingley  
   cried Elizabeth  
  said Bingley  
         cried Bingley; 
 Mr  Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended  and therefore checked her laugh  Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received  in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense    said his friend  
   said Elizabeth  
 Mr  Darcy took her advice  and did finish his letter   When that business was over  he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music  Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and  after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived  she seated herself   Mrs  Hurst sang with her sister  and while they were thus employed  Elizabeth could not help observing  as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument  how frequently Mr  Darcy s eyes were fixed on her  She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her  was still more strange  She could only imagine  however  at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible  according to his ideas of right  than in any other person present  The supposition did not pain her  She liked him too little to care for his approbation   After playing some Italian songs  Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr  Darcy  drawing near Elizabeth  said to her:   She smiled  but made no answer  He repeated the question  with some surprise at her silence    said she  
  Elizabeth  having rather expected to affront him  was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her  He really believed  that were it not for the inferiority of her connections  he should be in some danger   Miss Bingley saw  or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth   She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest  by talking of their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in such an alliance    said she  as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day  
    At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs  Hurst and Elizabeth herself     answered Mrs  Hurst  
 Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr  Darcy  she left Elizabeth to walk by herself  The path just admitted three  Mr  Darcy felt their rudeness  and immediately said:   But Elizabeth  who had not the least inclination to remain with them  laughingly answered:   She then ran gaily off  rejoicing as she rambled about  in the hope of being at home again in a day or two  Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening       Chapter 11  When the ladies removed after dinner  Elizabeth ran up to her sister  and seeing her well guarded from cold  attended her into the drawing-room  where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared  Their powers of conversation were considerable  They could describe an entertainment with accuracy  relate an anecdote with humour  and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit   But when the gentlemen entered  Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy  and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps  He addressed himself to Miss Bennet  with a polite congratulation; Mr  Hurst also made her a slight bow  and said he was  When tea was over  Mr  Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain  She had obtained private intelligence that Mr  Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr  Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected  She assured him that no one intended to play  and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her  Mr  Hurst had therefore nothing to do  but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep  Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs  Hurst  principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings  joined now and then in her brother s conversation with Miss Bennet   Miss Bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr  Darcy s progress through his book  as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry  or looking at his page  She could not win him  however  to any conversation; he merely answered her question  and read on  At length  quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book  which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his  she gave a great yawn and said   No one made any reply  She then yawned again  threw aside her book  and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet  she turned suddenly towards him and said:    cried her brother  
  she replied  
  Miss Bingley made no answer  and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room  Her figure was elegant  and she walked well; but Darcy  at whom it was all aimed  was still inflexibly studious  In the desperation of her feelings  she resolved on one effort more  and  turning to Elizabeth  said:   Elizabeth was surprised  but agreed to it immediately  Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr  Darcy looked up  He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be  and unconsciously closed his book  He was directly invited to join their party  but he declined it  observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together  with either of which motives his joining them would interfere    was her answer; 
 Miss Bingley  however  was incapable of disappointing Mr  Darcy in anything  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives    said he  as soon as she allowed him to speak  
  cried Miss Bingley  
  said Elizabeth  
   cried Elizabeth  
  said he  
  replied Elizabeth—
    Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile    said Miss Bingley; 
   said Darcy  
  cried Elizabeth  
    he replied with a smile  
  cried Miss Bingley  tired of a conversation in which she had no share  
 Her sister had not the smallest objection  and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy  after a few moments  recollection  was not sorry for it  He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention       Chapter 12  In consequence of an agreement between the sisters  Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother  to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day  But Mrs  Bennet  who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday  which would exactly finish Jane s week  could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before  Her answer  therefore  was not propitious  at least not to Elizabeth s wishes  for she was impatient to get home  Mrs  Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added  that if Mr  Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer  she could spare them very well  Against staying longer  however  Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful  on the contrary  as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long  she urged Jane to borrow Mr  Bingley s carriage immediately  and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned  and the request made   The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred  Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay  for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other   The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon  and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her—that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right   To Mr  Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough  She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her  and more teasing than usual to himself  He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him  nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested  his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it  Steady to his purpose  he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday  and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour  he adhered most conscientiously to his book  and would not even look at her   On Sunday  after morning service  the separation  so agreeable to almost all  took place  Miss Bingley s civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly  as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted  after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield  and embracing her most tenderly  she even shook hands with the former  Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits   They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother  Mrs  Bennet wondered at their coming  and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble  and was sure Jane would have caught cold again  But their father  though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure  was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle  The evening conversation  when they were all assembled  had lost much of its animation  and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth   They found Mary  as usual  deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire  and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to  Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort  Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle  a private had been flogged  and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married       Chapter 13   said Mr  Bennet to his wife  as they were at breakfast the next morning  
   Mrs  Bennet s eyes sparkled    said her husband; 
 This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once   After amusing himself some time with their curiosity  he thus explained:    cried his wife  
 Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail  They had often attempted to do it before  but it was a subject on which Mrs  Bennet was beyond the reach of reason  and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters  in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about    said Mr  Bennet  
    WILLIAM COLLINS
At four o clock  therefore  we may expect this peace-making gentleman 
He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man  upon my word  and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance  especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again 
There is some sense in what he says about the girls  however  and if he is disposed to make them any amends  I shall not be the person to discourage him 
Though it is difficult 
to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due  the wish is certainly to his credit 
He must be an oddity  I think 
I cannot make him out —There is something very pompous in his style —And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail —We cannot suppose he would help it if he could —Could he be a sensible man  sir 
No  my dear  I think not  I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse  There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter  which promises well  I am impatient to see him 
In point of composition 
the letter does not seem defective  The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new  yet I think it is well expressed 
You are very kind  I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so  for else they will be destitute enough  Things are settled so oddly 
You allude  perhaps  to the entail of this estate 
Ah! sir  I do indeed  It is a grievous affair to my poor girls  you must confess  Not that I mean to find fault with you  for such things I know are all chance in this world  There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed 
I am very sensible  madam  of the hardship to my fair cousins  and could say much on the subject  but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate  But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them  At present I will not say more; but  perhaps  when we are better acquainted—
he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension  as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine  She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her  She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings  and had sent for him only the Saturday before  to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening  Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew  but he had never seen anything but affability in her  She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two  to visit his relations  She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could  provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage  where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making  and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs 
That is all very proper and civil  I am sure 
and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman  It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her  Does she live near you  sir 
The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park  her ladyship s residence 
I think you said she was a widow  sir  Has she any family 
She has only one daughter  the heiress of Rosings  and of very extensive property 
Ah!
then she is better off than many girls  And what sort of young lady is she  Is she handsome 
She is a most charming young lady indeed  Lady Catherine herself says that  in point of true beauty  Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex  because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth  She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution  which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of  as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education  and who still resides with them  But she is perfectly amiable  and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies 
Has she been presented  I do not remember her name among the ladies at court 
Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means  as I told Lady Catherine one day  has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament  Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies  I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine  that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess  and that the most elevated rank  instead of giving her consequence  would be adorned by her  These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship  and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay 
You judge very properly 
and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy  May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment  or are the result of previous study 
They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time  and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions  I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible 
Do you know  mamma  that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does  Colonel Forster will hire him  My aunt told me so herself on Saturday  I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it  and to ask when Mr  Denny comes back from town 
I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp  though written solely for their benefit  It amazes me  I confess; for  certainly  there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction  But I will no longer importune my young cousin 
As to her younger daughters  she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter  she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint  was likely to be very soon engaged 
stupid  disagreeable fellows 
I know little of the game at present 
but I shall be glad to improve myself  for in my situation in life—
About a month 
He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire  I understand 
Yes 
his estate there is a noble one  A clear ten thousand per annum  You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself  for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy 
You may well be surprised  Miss Bennet  at such an assertion  after seeing  as you probably might  the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday  Are you much acquainted with Mr  Darcy 
As much as I ever wish to be 
I have spent four days in the same house with him  and I think him very disagreeable 
I have no right to give my opinion 
as to his being agreeable or otherwise  I am not qualified to form one  I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge  It is impossible for me to be impartial  But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else  Here you are in your own family 
Upon my word  I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood  except Netherfield  He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire  Everybody is disgusted with his pride  You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone 
I cannot pretend to be sorry 
that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen  The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence  or frightened by his high and imposing manners  and sees him only as he chooses to be seen 
I should take him  even on my slight acquaintance  to be an ill-tempered man 
I wonder 
whether he is likely to be in this country much longer 
I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield  I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood 
Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr  Darcy  If he wishes to avoid seeing me  he must go  We are not on friendly terms  and it always gives me pain to meet him  but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world  a sense of very great ill-usage  and most painful regrets at his being what he is  His father  Miss Bennet  the late Mr  Darcy  was one of the best men that ever breathed  and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr  Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections  His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything  rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father 
It was the prospect of constant society  and good society 
which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire  I knew it to be a most respectable  agreeable corps  and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters  and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them  Society  I own  is necessary to me  I have been a disappointed man  and my spirits will not bear solitude  I must have employment and society  A military life is not what I was intended for  but circumstances have now made it eligible  The church ought to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church  and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living  had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now 
Indeed!
Yes—the late Mr  Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift  He was my godfather  and excessively attached to me  I cannot do justice to his kindness  He meant to provide for me amply  and thought he had done it; but when the living fell  it was given elsewhere 
Good heavens!
but how could that be  How could his will be disregarded  Why did you not seek legal redress 
There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law  A man of honour could not have doubted the intention  but Mr  Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation  and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance  imprudence—in short anything or nothing  Certain it is  that the living became vacant two years ago  exactly as I was of an age to hold it  and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it  that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it  I have a warm  unguarded temper  and I may have spoken my opinion of him  and to him  too freely  I can recall nothing worse  But the fact is  that we are very different sort of men  and that he hates me 
This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced 
Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me  Till I can forget his father  I can never defy or expose him 
But what 
can have been his motive  What can have induced him to behave so cruelly 
A thorough  determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy  Had the late Mr  Darcy liked me less  his son might have borne with me better; but his father s uncommon attachment to me irritated him  I believe  very early in life  He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me 
I had not thought Mr  Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him  I had not thought so very ill of him  I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general  but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge  such injustice  such inhumanity as this 
I do remember his boasting one day  at Netherfield  of the implacability of his resentments  of his having an unforgiving temper  His disposition must be dreadful 
I will not trust myself on the subject 
I can hardly be just to him 
To treat in such a manner the godson  the friend  the favourite of his father!
A young man  too  like you  whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable
and one  too  who had probably been his companion from childhood  connected together  as I think you said  in the closest manner!
We were born in the same parish  within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house  sharing the same amusements  objects of the same parental care  My father began life in the profession which your uncle  Mr  Phillips  appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr  Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property  He was most highly esteemed by Mr  Darcy  a most intimate  confidential friend  Mr  Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence  and when  immediately before my father s death  Mr  Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me  I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him  as of his affection to myself 
How strange!
How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr  Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive  that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it 
It is wonderful 
for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend  It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling  But we are none of us consistent  and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride 
Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good 
Yes  It has often led him to be liberal and generous  to give his money freely  to display hospitality  to assist his tenants  and relieve the poor  Family pride  and filial pride—for he is very proud of what his father was—have done this  Not to appear to disgrace his family  to degenerate from the popular qualities  or lose the influence of the Pemberley House  is a powerful motive  He has also brotherly pride  which  with some brotherly affection  makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister  and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers 
What sort of girl is Miss Darcy 
I wish I could call her amiable  It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy  But she is too much like her brother—very  very proud  As a child  she was affectionate and pleasing  and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement  But she is nothing to me now  She is a handsome girl  about fifteen or sixteen  and  I understand  highly accomplished  Since her father s death  her home has been London  where a lady lives with her  and superintends her education 
I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr  Bingley! How can Mr  Bingley  who seems good humour itself  and is  I really believe  truly amiable  be in friendship with such a man  How can they suit each other  Do you know Mr  Bingley 
Not at all 
He is a sweet-tempered  amiable  charming man  He cannot know what Mr  Darcy is 
Probably not; but Mr  Darcy can please where he chooses  He does not want abilities  He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while  Among those who are at all his equals in consequence  he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous  His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded  just  sincere  rational  honourable  and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure 
I know very well  madam 
that when persons sit down to a card-table  they must take their chances of these things  and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object  There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same  but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh  I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh 
has very lately given him a living  I hardly know how Mr  Collins was first introduced to her notice  but he certainly has not known her long 
You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr  Darcy 
No  indeed  I did not  I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine s connections  I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday 
Her daughter  Miss de Bourgh  will have a very large fortune  and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates 
Mr  Collins 
speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship  I suspect his gratitude misleads him  and that in spite of her being his patroness  she is an arrogant  conceited woman 
I believe her to be both in a great degree 
I have not seen her for many years  but I very well remember that I never liked her  and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent  She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune  part from her authoritative manner  and the rest from the pride for her nephew  who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class 
They have both 
been deceived  I dare say  in some way or other  of which we can form no idea  Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other  It is  in short  impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them  without actual blame on either side 
Very true  indeed; and now  my dear Jane  what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business  Do clear them too  or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody 
Laugh as much as you choose  but you will not laugh me out of my opinion  My dearest Lizzy  do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr  Darcy  to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner  one whom his father had promised to provide for  It is impossible  No man of common humanity  no man who had any value for his character  could be capable of it  Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him  Oh! no 
I can much more easily believe Mr  Bingley s being imposed on  than that Mr  Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names  facts  everything mentioned without ceremony  If it be not so  let Mr  Darcy contradict it  Besides  there was truth in his looks 
It is difficult indeed—it is distressing  One does not know what to think 
I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think 
While I can have my mornings to myself 
it is enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements  Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody 
I am by no means of the opinion  I assure you 
that a ball of this kind  given by a young man of character  to respectable people  can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself  that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours  Miss Elizabeth  for the two first dances especially  a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause  and not to any disrespect for her 
I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now  if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here 
I dare say you will find him very agreeable 
Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil 
It is your turn to say something now  Mr  Darcy  I talked about the dance  and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room  or the number of couples 
Very well  That reply will do for the present  Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones  But now we may be silent 
Do you talk by rule  then  while you are dancing 
Sometimes  One must speak a little  you know  It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some  conversation ought to be so arranged  as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible 
Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case  or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine 
Both 
for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds  We are each of an unsocial  taciturn disposition  unwilling to speak  unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room  and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb 
This is no very striking resemblance of your own character  I am sure 
How near it may be to mine  I cannot pretend to say  You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly 
I must not decide on my own performance 
When you met us there the other day  we had just been forming a new acquaintance 
Mr  Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable of retaining them  is less certain 
He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship 
and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life 
I have been most highly gratified indeed  my dear sir  Such very superior dancing is not often seen  It is evident that you belong to the first circles  Allow me to say  however  that your fair partner does not disgrace you  and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated  especially when a certain desirable event  my dear Eliza  glancing at her sister and Bingley  shall take place  What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr  Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you  sir  You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady  whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me 
Sir William s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of 
I do not think we were speaking at all  Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves  We have tried two or three subjects already without success  and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine 
What think you of books 
Books—oh! no  I am sure we never read the same  or not with the same feelings 
I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case  there can at least be no want of subject  We may compare our different opinions 
No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else 
The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it 
Yes  always 
I remember hearing you once say  Mr  Darcy  that you hardly ever forgave  that your resentment once created was unappeasable  You are very cautious  I suppose  as to its being created 
I am 
And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice 
I hope not 
It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion  to be secure of judging properly at first 
May I ask to what these questions tend 
Merely to the illustration of your character 
I am trying to make it out 
And what is your success 
I do not get on at all  I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly 
I can readily believe 
that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish  Miss Bennet  that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment  as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either 
But if I do not take your likeness now  I may never have another opportunity 
I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours 
So  Miss Eliza  I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you  among his other communication  that he was the son of old Wickham  the late Mr  Darcy s steward  Let me recommend you  however  as a friend  not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr  Darcy s using him ill  it is perfectly false; for  on the contrary  he has always been remarkably kind to him  though George Wickham has treated Mr  Darcy in a most infamous manner  I do not know the particulars  but I know very well that Mr  Darcy is not in the least to blame  that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned  and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers  he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way  His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing  indeed  and I wonder how he could presume to do it  I pity you  Miss Eliza  for this discovery of your favourite s guilt; but really  considering his descent  one could not expect much better 
His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same 
for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr  Darcy s steward  and of that  I can assure you  he informed me himself 
I beg your pardon 
Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant 
Insolent girl!
You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this  I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr  Darcy 
I want to know 
what you have learnt about Mr  Wickham  But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon 
No 
I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you  Mr  Bingley does not know the whole of his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr  Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct  the probity  and honour of his friend  and is perfectly convinced that Mr  Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr  Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister s  Mr  Wickham is by no means a respectable young man  I am afraid he has been very imprudent  and has deserved to lose Mr  Darcy s regard 
Mr  Bingley does not know Mr  Wickham himself 
No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton 
This account then is what he has received from Mr  Darcy  I am satisfied  But what does he say of the living 
He does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has heard them from Mr  Darcy more than once  but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only 
I have not a doubt of Mr  Bingley s sincerity 
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only  Mr  Bingley s defense of his friend was a very able one  I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story  and has learnt the rest from that friend himself  I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before 
I have found out 
by a singular accident  that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness  I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh  and of her mother Lady Catherine  How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with  perhaps  a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him  which I am now going to do  and trust he will excuse my not having done it before  My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology 
You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr  Darcy!
Indeed I am  I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier  I believe him to be Lady Catherine s nephew  It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se nnight 
My dear Miss Elizabeth  I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say  that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity  and those which regulate the clergy; for  give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained  You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty  Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant guide  though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself 
apology 
Hunsford 
Lady Catherine de Bourgh 
I have no reason  I assure you 
to be dissatisfied with my reception  Mr  Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention  He answered me with the utmost civility  and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine s discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily  It was really a very handsome thought  Upon the whole  I am much pleased with him 
What is Mr  Darcy to me  pray  that I should be afraid of him  I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear 
For heaven s sake  madam  speak lower  What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr  Darcy  You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!
That will do extremely well  child  You have delighted us long enough  Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit 
If I 
were so fortunate as to be able to sing  I should have great pleasure  I am sure  in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion  and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman  I do not mean  however  to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music  for there are certainly other things to be attended to  The rector of a parish has much to do  In the first place  he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron  He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and the care and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible  And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody  especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment  I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family 
Lord  how tired I am!
May I hope  madam  for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth  when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning 
Oh dear!—yes—certainly  I am sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection  Come  Kitty  I want you up stairs 
Dear madam  do not go  I beg you will not go  Mr  Collins must excuse me  He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear  I am going away myself 
No  no  nonsense  Lizzy  I desire you to stay where you are 
Lizzy  I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr  Collins 
Believe me  my dear Miss Elizabeth  that your modesty  so far from doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other perfections  You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you  that I have your respected mother s permission for this address  You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse  however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken  Almost as soon as I entered the house  I singled you out as the companion of my future life  But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject  perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and  moreover  for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife  as I certainly did 
My reasons for marrying are  first  that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances  like myself  to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly  that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier  that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness  Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion  unasked too!  on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille  while Mrs  Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh s footstool  that she said   Mr  Collins  you must marry  A clergyman like you must marry  Choose properly  choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own  let her be an active  useful sort of person  not brought up high  but able to make a small income go a good way  This is my advice  Find such a woman as soon as you can  bring her to Hunsford  and I will visit her   Allow me  by the way  to observe  my fair cousin  that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer  You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity  I think  must be acceptable to her  especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite  Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood  where I can assure you there are many amiable young women  But the fact is  that being  as I am  to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father  who  however  may live many years longer   I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters  that the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the melancholy event takes place—which  however  as I have already said  may not be for several years  This has been my motive  my fair cousin  and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem  And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection  To fortune I am perfectly indifferent  and shall make no demand of that nature on your father  since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents  which will not be yours till after your mother s decease  is all that you may ever be entitled to  On that head  therefore  I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married 
You are too hasty  sir 
You forget that I have made no answer  Let me do it without further loss of time  Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me  I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals  but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them 
I am not now to learn 
that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second  or even a third time  I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said  and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long 
Upon my word  sir 
your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration  I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are  who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time  I am perfectly serious in my refusal  You could not make me happy  and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so  Nay  were your friend Lady Catherine to know me  I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation 
Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so 
but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you  And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again  I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty  economy  and other amiable qualification 
Indeed  Mr  Collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary  You must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment of believing what I say  I wish you very happy and very rich  and by refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise  In making me the offer  you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family  and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls  without any self-reproach  This matter may be considered  therefore  as finally settled 
When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject  I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present  because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application  and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character 
Really  Mr  Collins 
you puzzle me exceedingly  If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement  I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one 
You must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course  My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance  or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable  My situation in life  my connections with the family of de Bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration  that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you  Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications  As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me  I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense  according to the usual practice of elegant females 
I do assure you  sir  that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man  I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere  I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals  but to accept them is absolutely impossible  My feelings in every respect forbid it  Can I speak plainer  Do not consider me now as an elegant female  intending to plague you  but as a rational creature  speaking the truth from her heart 
You are uniformly charming!
and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals will not fail of being acceptable 
But  depend upon it  Mr  Collins 
that Lizzy shall be brought to reason  I will speak to her about it directly  She is a very headstrong  foolish girl  and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it 
Pardon me for interrupting you  madam 
but if she is really headstrong and foolish  I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation  who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state  If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit  perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me  because if liable to such defects of temper  she could not contribute much to my felicity 
Sir  you quite misunderstand me 
Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these  In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived  I will go directly to Mr  Bennet  and we shall very soon settle it with her  I am sure 
Oh! Mr  Bennet  you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar  You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr  Collins  for she vows she will not have him  and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her 
I have not the pleasure of understanding you 
Of what are you talking 
Of Mr  Collins and Lizzy  Lizzy declares she will not have Mr  Collins  and Mr  Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy 
And what am I to do on the occasion  It seems an hopeless business 
Speak to Lizzy about it yourself  Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him 
Let her be called down  She shall hear my opinion 
Come here  child 
I have sent for you on an affair of importance  I understand that Mr  Collins has made you an offer of marriage  Is it true 
Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused 
I have  sir 
Very well  We now come to the point  Your mother insists upon your accepting it  Is it not so  Mrs  Bennet 
Yes  or I will never see her again 
An unhappy alternative is before you  Elizabeth  From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents  Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr  Collins  and I will never see you again if you do 
What do you mean  Mr  Bennet  in talking this way  You promised me to insist upon her marrying him 
My dear 
I have two small favours to request  First  that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly  of my room  I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be 
I am glad you are come  for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning  Mr  Collins has made an offer to Lizzy  and she will not have him 
Pray do  my dear Miss Lucas 
for nobody is on my side  nobody takes part with me  I am cruelly used  nobody feels for my poor nerves 
Aye  there she comes 
looking as unconcerned as may be  and caring no more for us than if we were at York  provided she can have her own way  But I tell you  Miss Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way  you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead  I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you  I have done with you from this very day  I told you in the library  you know  that I should never speak to you again  and you will find me as good as my word  I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children  Not that I have much pleasure  indeed  in talking to anybody  People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking  Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so  Those who do not complain are never pitied 
Now  I do insist upon it  that you  all of you  hold your tongues  and let me and Mr  Collins have a little conversation together 
Oh! Mr  Collins!
My dear madam 
let us be for ever silent on this point  Far be it from me 
to resent the behaviour of your daughter  Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned  Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation  You will not  I hope  consider me as showing any disrespect to your family  my dear madam  by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter s favour  without having paid yourself and Mr  Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf  My conduct may  I fear  be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own  But we are all liable to error  I have certainly meant well through the whole affair  My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself  with due consideration for the advantage of all your family  and if my manner has been at all reprehensible  I here beg leave to apologise 
I found 
as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr  Darcy; that to be in the same room  the same party with him for so many hours together  might be more than I could bear  and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself 
This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal  The whole party have left Netherfield by this time  and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming back again  You shall hear what she says 
I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend; but we will hope  at some future period  to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known  and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence  I depend on you for that 
It is unlucky 
that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country  But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware  and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters  Mr  Bingley will not be detained in London by them 
Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter  I will read it to you:
When my brother left us yesterday  he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so  and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again  we have determined on following him thither  that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel  Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you  my dearest friend  had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair  I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you 
It is evident by this 
that he comes back no more this winter 
It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should 
Why will you think so  It must be his own doing  He is his own master  But you do not know all  I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me  I will have no reserves from you 
Mr  Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and  to confess the truth  we are scarcely less eager to meet her again  I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance  and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting  from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister  I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them  and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable  My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister s partiality is not misleading me  I think  when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart  With all these circumstances to favour an attachment  and nothing to prevent it  am I wrong  my dearest Jane  in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many 
What do you think of this sentence  my dear Lizzy 
Is it not clear enough  Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him  she means  most kindly!  to put me on my guard  Can there be any other opinion on the subject 
Yes  there can; for mine is totally different  Will you hear it 
Most willingly 
You shall have it in a few words  Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you  and wants him to marry Miss Darcy  She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there  and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you 
Indeed  Jane  you ought to believe me  No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection  Miss Bingley  I am sure  cannot  She is not such a simpleton  Could she have seen half as much love in Mr  Darcy for herself  she would have ordered her wedding clothes  But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother  from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage  she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and I dare say it would succeed  if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way  But  my dearest Jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy  he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday  or that it will be in her power to persuade him that  instead of being in love with you  he is very much in love with her friend 
If we thought alike of Miss Bingley 
your representation of all this might make me quite easy  But I know the foundation is unjust  Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself 
That is right  You could not have started a more happy idea  since you will not take comfort in mine  Believe her to be deceived  by all means  You have now done your duty by her  and must fret no longer 
But  my dear sister  can I be happy  even supposing the best  in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere 
You must decide for yourself 
and if  upon mature deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife  I advise you by all means to refuse him 
How can you talk so 
You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation  I could not hesitate 
I did not think you would; and that being the case  I cannot consider your situation with much compassion 
But if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be required  A thousand things may arise in six months!
It keeps him in good humour 
and I am more obliged to you than I can express 
My dear madam 
this invitation is particularly gratifying  because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible 
But is there not danger of Lady Catherine s disapprobation here  my good sir  You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness 
My dear sir 
I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship s concurrence 
You cannot be too much upon your guard  Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again  which I should think exceedingly probable  stay quietly at home  and be satisfied that we shall take no offence 
Believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it  you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this  and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire  As for my fair cousins  though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary  I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness  not excepting my cousin Elizabeth 
Engaged to Mr  Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!
Why should you be surprised  my dear Eliza  Do you think it incredible that Mr  Collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion  because he was not so happy as to succeed with you 
I see what you are feeling 
You must be surprised  very much surprised—so lately as Mr  Collins was wishing to marry you  But when you have had time to think it over  I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done  I am not romantic  you know; I never was  I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr  Collins s character  connection  and situation in life  I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state 
Undoubtedly;
Good Lord! Sir William  how can you tell such a story  Do not you know that Mr  Collins wants to marry Lizzy 
Indeed  Mr  Bennet 
it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that I should be forced to make way for her  and live to see her take her place in it!
My dear  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts  Let us hope for better things  Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor 
I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate  If it was not for the entail  I should not mind it 
What should not you mind 
I should not mind anything at all 
Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility 
I never can be thankful  Mr  Bennet  for anything about the entail  How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own daughters  I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr  Collins too! Why should he have it more than anybody else 
I leave it to yourself to determine 
Oh  that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him  But I will not repine  It cannot last long  He will be forgot  and we shall all be as we were before 
You doubt me 
indeed  you have no reason  He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance  but that is all  I have nothing either to hope or fear  and nothing to reproach him with  Thank God! I have not that pain  A little time  therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better 
I have this comfort immediately  that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side  and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself 
My dear Jane!
you are too good  Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you  I feel as if I had never done you justice  or loved you as you deserve 
Nay 
this is not fair  You wish to think all the world respectable  and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody  I only want to think you perfect  and you set yourself against it  Do not be afraid of my running into any excess  of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will  You need not  There are few people whom I really love  and still fewer of whom I think well  The more I see of the world  the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters  and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense  I have met with two instances lately  one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte s marriage  It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!
My dear Lizzy  do not give way to such feelings as these  They will ruin your happiness  You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper  Consider Mr  Collins s respectability  and Charlotte s steady  prudent character  Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune  it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe  for everybody s sake  that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin 
To oblige you  I would try to believe almost anything  but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him  I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart  My dear Jane  Mr  Collins is a conceited  pompous  narrow-minded  silly man; you know he is  as well as I do; and you must feel  as well as I do  that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking  You shall not defend her  though it is Charlotte Lucas  You shall not  for the sake of one individual  change the meaning of principle and integrity  nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me  that selfishness is prudence  and insensibility of danger security for happiness 
I must think your language too strong in speaking of both 
and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together  But enough of this  You alluded to something else  You mentioned two instances  I cannot misunderstand you  but I entreat you  dear Lizzy  not to pain me by thinking that person to blame  and saying your opinion of him is sunk  We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured  We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect  It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us  Women fancy admiration means more than it does 
And men take care that they should 
If it is designedly done  they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine 
I am far from attributing any part of Mr  Bingley s conduct to design 
but without scheming to do wrong  or to make others unhappy  there may be error  and there may be misery  Thoughtlessness  want of attention to other people s feelings  and want of resolution  will do the business 
And do you impute it to either of those 
Yes; to the last  But if I go on  I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem  Stop me whilst you can 
You persist  then  in supposing his sisters influence him 
Yes  in conjunction with his friend 
I cannot believe it  Why should they try to influence him  They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me  no other woman can secure it 
Your first position is false  They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money  great connections  and pride 
Beyond a doubt  they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy 
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing  They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better  But  whatever may be their own wishes  it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s  What sister would think herself at liberty to do it  unless there were something very objectionable  If they believed him attached to me  they would not try to part us; if he were so  they could not succeed  By supposing such an affection  you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong  and me most unhappy  Do not distress me by the idea  I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or  at least  it is light  it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters  Let me take it in the best light  in the light in which it may be understood 
So  Lizzy 
your sister is crossed in love  I find  I congratulate her  Next to being married  a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then  It is something to think of  and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions  When is your turn to come  You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane  Now is your time  Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country  Let Wickham be your man  He is a pleasant fellow  and would jilt you creditably 
Thank you  sir  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me  We must not all expect Jane s good fortune 
True 
but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you  you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it 
I do not blame Jane 
for Jane would have got Mr  Bingley if she could  But Lizzy! Oh  sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr  Collins s wife by this time  had it not been for her own perverseness  He made her an offer in this very room  and she refused him  The consequence of it is  that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have  and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever  The Lucases are very artful people indeed  sister  They are all for what they can get  I am sorry to say it of them  but so it is  It makes me very nervous and poorly  to be thwarted so in my own family  and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else  However  your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts  and I am very glad to hear what you tell us  of long sleeves 
It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane 
I am sorry it went off  But these things happen so often! A young man  such as you describe Mr  Bingley  so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks  and when accident separates them  so easily forgets her  that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent 
An excellent consolation in its way 
but it will not do for us  We do not suffer by accident  It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before 
But that expression of  violently in love  is so hackneyed  so doubtful  so indefinite  that it gives me very little idea  It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour s acquaintance  as to a real  strong attachment  Pray  how violent was Mr  Bingley s love 
I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her  Every time they met  it was more decided and remarkable  At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies  by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself  without receiving an answer  Could there be finer symptoms  Is not general incivility the very essence of love 
Oh  yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt  Poor Jane! I am sorry for her  because  with her disposition  she may not get over it immediately  It had better have happened to you  Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner  But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us  Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything 
I hope 
that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her  We live in so different a part of town  all our connections are so different  and  as you well know  we go out so little  that it is very improbable that they should meet at all  unless he really comes to see her 
And that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend  and Mr  Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt  how could you think of it  Mr  Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street  but he would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities  were he once to enter it; and depend upon it  Mr  Bingley never stirs without him 
So much the better  I hope they will not meet at all  But does not Jane correspond with his sister  She will not be able to help calling 
She will drop the acquaintance entirely 
You are too sensible a girl  Lizzy  to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and  therefore  I am not afraid of speaking openly  Seriously  I would have you be on your guard  Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent  I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have  I should think you could not do better  But as it is  you must not let your fancy run away with you  You have sense  and we all expect you to use it  Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct  I am sure  You must not disappoint your father 
My dear aunt  this is being serious indeed 
Yes  and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise 
Well  then  you need not be under any alarm  I will take care of myself  and of Mr  Wickham too  He shall not be in love with me  if I can prevent it 
Elizabeth  you are not serious now 
I beg your pardon  I will try again  At present I am not in love with Mr  Wickham; no  I certainly am not  But he is  beyond all comparison  the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not  I see the imprudence of it  Oh! that abominable Mr  Darcy! My father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour  and I should be miserable to forfeit it  My father  however  is partial to Mr  Wickham  In short  my dear aunt  I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection  young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other  how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted  or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist  All that I can promise you  therefore  is not to be in a hurry  I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object  When I am in company with him  I will not be wishing  In short  I will do my best 
Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often  At least  you should not remind your mother of inviting him 
As I did the other day 
very true  it will be wise in me to refrain from that  But do not imagine that he is always here so often  It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week  You know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends  But really  and upon my honour  I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied 
wished they might be happy 
I shall depend on hearing from you very often  Eliza 
That you certainly shall 
And I have another favour to ask you  Will you come and see me 
We shall often meet  I hope  in Hertfordshire 
I am not likely to leave Kent for some time  Promise me  therefore  to come to Hunsford 
My father and Maria are coming to me in March 
and I hope you will consent to be of the party  Indeed  Eliza  you will be as welcome as either of them 
My aunt 
is going to-morrow into that part of the town  and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street 
I did not think Caroline in spirits 
but she was very glad to see me  and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London  I was right  therefore  my last letter had never reached her  I inquired after their brother  of course  He was well  but so much engaged with Mr  Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him  I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner  I wish I could see her  My visit was not long  as Caroline and Mrs  Hurst were going out  I dare say I shall see them soon here 
My dearest Lizzy will  I am sure  be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement  at my expense  when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley s regard for me  But  my dear sister  though the event has proved you right  do not think me obstinate if I still assert that  considering what her behaviour was  my confidence was as natural as your suspicion  I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again  I am sure I should be deceived again  Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note  not a line  did I receive in the meantime  When she did come  it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight  formal apology  for not calling before  said not a word of wishing to see me again  and was in every respect so altered a creature  that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer  I pity  though I cannot help blaming her  She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side  But I pity her  because she must feel that she has been acting wrong  and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it  I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless  yet if she feels it  it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable  I cannot but wonder  however  at her having any such fears now  because  if he had at all cared about me  we must have met  long ago  He knows of my being in town  I am certain  from something she said herself; and yet it would seem  by her manner of talking  as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy  I cannot understand it  If I were not afraid of judging harshly  I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this  But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought  and think only of what will make me happy—your affection  and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt  Let me hear from you very soon  Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again  of giving up the house  but not with any certainty  We had better not mention it  I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford  Pray go to see them  with Sir William and Maria  I am sure you will be very comfortable there —Yours  etc 
I am now convinced  my dear aunt  that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion  I should at present detest his very name  and wish him all manner of evil  But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King  I cannot find out that I hate her at all  or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl  There can be no love in all this  My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him  I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance  Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly  Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do  They are young in the ways of the world  and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain 
But my dear Elizabeth 
what sort of girl is Miss King  I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary 
Pray  my dear aunt  what is the difference in matrimonial affairs  between the mercenary and the prudent motive  Where does discretion end  and avarice begin  Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me  because it would be imprudent; and now  because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds  you want to find out that he is mercenary 
If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is  I shall know what to think 
She is a very good kind of girl  I believe  I know no harm of her 
But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death made her mistress of this fortune 
No—why should he  If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I had no money  what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about  and who was equally poor 
But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event 
A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe  If she does not object to it  why should we 
Her not objecting does not justify him  It only shows her being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling 
Well 
have it as you choose  He shall be mercenary  and she shall be foolish 
No  Lizzy  that is what I do not choose  I should be sorry  you know  to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire 
Oh! if that is all  I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better  I am sick of them all  Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality  who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him  Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing  after all 
Take care  Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment 
We have not determined how far it shall carry us 
but  perhaps  to the Lakes 
Oh  my dear  dear aunt 
what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour  Adieu to disappointment and spleen  What are young men to rocks and mountains  Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return  it shall not be like other travellers  without being able to give one accurate idea of anything  We will know where we have gone—we will recollect what we have seen  Lakes  mountains  and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene  will we begin quarreling about its relative situation  Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers 
Yes  Miss Elizabeth  you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church  and I need not say you will be delighted with her  She is all affability and condescension  and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over  I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here  Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming  We dine at Rosings twice every week  and are never allowed to walk home  Her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us  I should say  one of her ladyship s carriages  for she has several 
Lady Catherine is a very respectable  sensible woman indeed 
and a most attentive neighbour 
Very true  my dear  that is exactly what I say  She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference 
Oh  my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room  for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is  Make haste  and come down this moment 
And is this all 
I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden  and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter 
La! my dear 
it is not Lady Catherine  The old lady is Mrs  Jenkinson  who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh  Only look at her  She is quite a little creature  Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small 
She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind  Why does she not come in 
Oh  Charlotte says she hardly ever does  It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in 
I like her appearance 
She looks sickly and cross  Yes  she will do for him very well  She will make him a very proper wife 
I confess 
that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings  I rather expected  from my knowledge of her affability  that it would happen  But who could have foreseen such an attention as this  Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there  an invitation  moreover  including the whole party  so immediately after your arrival!
I am the less surprised at what has happened 
from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are  which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire  About the court  such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon 
Do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel  Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter  I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more  Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed  She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved 
Your father s estate is entailed on Mr  Collins  I think  For your sake 
I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line  It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh s family  Do you play and sing  Miss Bennet 
A little 
Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you  Our instrument is a capital one  probably superior to——You shall try it some day  Do your sisters play and sing 
One of them does 
Why did not you all learn  You ought all to have learned  The Miss Webbs all play  and their father has not so good an income as yours  Do you draw 
No  not at all 
What  none of you 
Not one 
That is very strange  But I suppose you had no opportunity  Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters 
My mother would have had no objection  but my father hates London 
Has your governess left you 
We never had any governess 
No governess! How was that possible  Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing  Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education 
Then  who taught you  who attended to you  Without a governess  you must have been neglected 
Compared with some families  I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means  We were always encouraged to read  and had all the masters that were necessary  Those who chose to be idle  certainly might 
Aye  no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent  and if I had known your mother  I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one  I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction  and nobody but a governess can give it  It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way  I am always glad to get a young person well placed out  Four nieces of Mrs  Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person  who was merely accidentally mentioned to me  and the family are quite delighted with her  Mrs  Collins  did I tell you of Lady Metcalf s calling yesterday to thank me  She finds Miss Pope a treasure   Lady Catherine   said she   you have given me a treasure   Are any of your younger sisters out  Miss Bennet 
Yes  ma am  all 
All! What  all five out at once  Very odd! And you only the second  The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young 
Yes  my youngest is not sixteen  Perhaps she is full young to be much in company  But really  ma am  I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters  that they should not have their share of society and amusement  because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early  The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first  And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind 
Upon my word 
you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person  Pray  what is your age 
With three younger sisters grown up 
your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it 
You cannot be more than twenty  I am sure  therefore you need not conceal your age 
I am not one-and-twenty 
I may thank you  Eliza  for this piece of civility  Mr  Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me 
My eldest sister has been in town these three months  Have you never happened to see her there 
What is that you are saying  Fitzwilliam  What is it you are talking of  What are you telling Miss Bennet  Let me hear what it is 
We are speaking of music  madam 
Of music! Then pray speak aloud  It is of all subjects my delight  I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music  There are few people in England  I suppose  who have more true enjoyment of music than myself  or a better natural taste  If I had ever learnt  I should have been a great proficient  And so would Anne  if her health had allowed her to apply  I am confident that she would have performed delightfully  How does Georgiana get on  Darcy 
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her 
and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal 
I assure you  madam 
that she does not need such advice  She practises very constantly 
So much the better  It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her  I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account  I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice  I have told Miss Bennet several times  that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs  Collins has no instrument  she is very welcome  as I have often told her  to come to Rosings every day  and play on the pianoforte in Mrs  Jenkinson s room  She would be in nobody s way  you know  in that part of the house 
You mean to frighten me  Mr  Darcy  by coming in all this state to hear me  I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well  There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others  My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me 
I shall not say you are mistaken 
because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own 
Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me  and teach you not to believe a word I say  I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character  in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit  Indeed  Mr  Darcy  it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and  give me leave to say  very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear 
I am not afraid of you 
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of 
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers 
You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful  The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire  you must know  was at a ball—and at this ball  what do you think he did  He danced only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce; and  to my certain knowledge  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner  Mr  Darcy  you cannot deny the fact 
I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party 
True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room  Well  Colonel Fitzwilliam  what do I play next  My fingers wait your orders 
Perhaps 
I should have judged better  had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers 
Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this 
Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education  and who has lived in the world  is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers 
I can answer your question 
without applying to him  It is because he will not give himself the trouble 
I certainly have not the talent which some people possess 
of conversing easily with those I have never seen before  I cannot catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested in their concerns  as I often see done 
My fingers 
do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women s do  They have not the same force or rapidity  and do not produce the same expression  But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising  It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution 
You are perfectly right  You have employed your time much better  No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting  We neither of us perform to strangers 
Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more  and could have the advantage of a London master  She has a very good notion of fingering  though her taste is not equal to Anne s  Anne would have been a delightful performer  had her health allowed her to learn 
How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November  Mr  Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr  Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for  if I recollect right  he went but the day before  He and his sisters were well  I hope  when you left London 
Perfectly so  I thank you 
I think I have understood that Mr  Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again 
I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future  He has many friends  and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing 
If he means to be but little at Netherfield  it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely  for then we might possibly get a settled family there  But  perhaps  Mr  Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own  and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle 
I should not be surprised 
if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers 
This seems a very comfortable house  Lady Catherine  I believe  did a great deal to it when Mr  Collins first came to Hunsford 
I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object 
Mr  Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife 
Yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him  or have made him happy if they had  My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr  Collins as the wisest thing she ever did  She seems perfectly happy  however  and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her 
It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends 
An easy distance  do you call it  It is nearly fifty miles 
And what is fifty miles of good road  Little more than half a day s journey  Yes  I call it a very easy distance 
I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match 
I should never have said Mrs  Collins was settled near her family 
It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire  Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn  I suppose  would appear far 
I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family  The far and the near must be relative  and depend on many varying circumstances  Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil  But that is not the case here  Mr  and Mrs  Collins have a comfortable income  but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance 
You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment  You cannot have been always at Longbourn 
Are you pleased with Kent 
What can be the meaning of this 
My dear  Eliza  he must be in love with you  or he would never have called us in this familiar way 
I did not know before that you ever walked this way 
I have been making the tour of the park 
as I generally do every year  and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage  Are you going much farther 
No  I should have turned in a moment 
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday 
Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again  But I am at his disposal  He arranges the business just as he pleases 
And if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice  I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr  Darcy 
He likes to have his own way very well 
But so we all do  It is only that he has better means of having it than many others  because he is rich  and many others are poor  I speak feelingly  A younger son  you know  must be inured to self-denial and dependence 
In my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little of either  Now seriously  what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence  When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose  or procuring anything you had a fancy for 
These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature  But in matters of greater weight  I may suffer from want of money  Younger sons cannot marry where they like 
Unless where they like women of fortune  which I think they very often do 
Our habits of expense make us too dependent  and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money 
Is this 
meant for me 
And pray  what is the usual price of an earl s younger son  Unless the elder brother is very sickly  I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds 
I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal  I wonder he does not marry  to secure a lasting convenience of that kind  But  perhaps  his sister does as well for the present  and  as she is under his sole care  he may do what he likes with her 
No 
that is an advantage which he must divide with me  I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy 
Are you indeed  And pray what sort of guardians do you make  Does your charge give you much trouble  Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage  and if she has the true Darcy spirit  she may like to have her own way 
You need not be frightened  I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world  She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance  Mrs  Hurst and Miss Bingley  I think I have heard you say that you know them 
I know them a little  Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man—he is a great friend of Darcy s 
Oh! yes 
Mr  Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr  Bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him 
Care of him! Yes  I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care  From something that he told me in our journey hither  I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him  But I ought to beg his pardon  for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant  It was all conjecture 
What is it you mean 
It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known  because if it were to get round to the lady s family  it would be an unpleasant thing 
You may depend upon my not mentioning it 
And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley  What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any other particulars  and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort  and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer 
Did Mr  Darcy give you reasons for this interference 
I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady 
And what arts did he use to separate them 
He did not talk to me of his own arts 
He only told me what I have now told you 
I am thinking of what you have been telling me 
Your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings  Why was he to be the judge 
You are rather disposed to call his interference officious 
I do not see what right Mr  Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend s inclination  or why  upon his own judgement alone  he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy  But 
as we know none of the particulars  it is not fair to condemn him  It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case 
That is not an unnatural surmise 
but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly 
There were some very strong objections against the lady 
To Jane herself 
there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding excellent  her mind improved  and her manners captivating  Neither could anything be urged against my father  who  though with some peculiarities  has abilities Mr  Darcy himself need not disdain  and respectability which he will probably never reach 
In vain I have struggled  It will not do  My feelings will not be repressed  You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you 
In such cases as this  it is  I believe  the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however unequally they may be returned  It is natural that obligation should be felt  and if I could feel gratitude  I would now thank you  But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion  and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly  I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone  It has been most unconsciously done  however  and I hope will be of short duration  The feelings which  you tell me  have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard  can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation 
And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so little endeavour at civility  I am thus rejected  But it is of small importance 
I might as well inquire 
why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me  you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will  against your reason  and even against your character  Was not this some excuse for incivility  if I was uncivil  But I have other provocations  You know I have  Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most beloved sister 
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you  No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there  You dare not  you cannot deny  that you have been the principal  if not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability  and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes  and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind 
Can you deny that you have done it 
I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister  or that I rejoice in my success  Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself 
But it is not merely this affair 
on which my dislike is founded  Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided  Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr  Wickham  On this subject  what can you have to say  In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself  or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others 
You take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns 
Who that knows what his misfortunes have been  can help feeling an interest in him 
His misfortunes!
yes  his misfortunes have been great indeed 
And of your infliction 
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty  You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him  You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert  You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule 
And this 
is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully  My faults  according to this calculation  are heavy indeed! But perhaps 
these offenses might have been overlooked  had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design  These bitter accusations might have been suppressed  had I  with greater policy  concealed my struggles  and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified  unalloyed inclination; by reason  by reflection  by everything  But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence  Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related  They were natural and just  Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections —to congratulate myself on the hope of relations  whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own 
You are mistaken  Mr  Darcy  if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you  had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner 
You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it 
From the very beginning—from the first moment  I may almost say—of my acquaintance with you  your manners  impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others  were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry 
You have said quite enough  madam  I perfectly comprehend your feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been  Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness 
I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you  Will you do me the honour of reading that letter 
     FITZWILLIAM DARCY
This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!
How despicably I have acted!
I  who have prided myself on my discernment! I  who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister  and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet  how just a humiliation! Had I been in love  I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity  not love  has been my folly  Pleased with the preference of one  and offended by the neglect of the other  on the very beginning of our acquaintance  I have courted prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either were concerned  Till this moment I never knew myself 
What would she have said  how would she have behaved 
I assure you  I feel it exceedingly 
I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do  But I am particularly attached to these young men  and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are  The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely  more  I think  than last year  His attachment to Rosings certainly increases 
But if that is the case  you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer  Mrs  Collins will be very glad of your company  I am sure 
I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation 
but it is not in my power to accept it  I must be in town next Saturday 
Why  at that rate  you will have been here only six weeks  I expected you to stay two months  I told Mrs  Collins so before you came  There can be no occasion for your going so soon  Mrs  Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight 
But my father cannot  He wrote last week to hurry my return 
Oh! your father of course may spare you  if your mother can  Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father  And if you will stay another month complete  it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London  for I am going there early in June  for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box  there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  I should not object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large 
You are all kindness  madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan 
Mrs  Collins  you must send a servant with them  You know I always speak my mind  and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves  It is highly improper  You must contrive to send somebody  I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing  Young women should always be properly guarded and attended  according to their situation in life  When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer  I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her  Miss Darcy  the daughter of Mr  Darcy  of Pemberley  and Lady Anne  could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner  I am excessively attentive to all those things  You must send John with the young ladies  Mrs  Collins  I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone 
My uncle is to send a servant for us 
Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant  does he  I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things  Where shall you change horses  Oh! Bromley  of course  If you mention my name at the Bell  you will be attended to 
I know not  Miss Elizabeth 
whether Mrs  Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it  The favour of your company has been much felt  I assure you  We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode  Our plain manner of living  our small rooms and few domestics  and the little we see of the world  must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension  and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly 
It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably  We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society  and  from our connection with Rosings  the frequent means of varying the humble home scene  I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome  Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast  You see on what a footing we are  You see how continually we are engaged there  In truth I must acknowledge that  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage  I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion  while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings 
You may  in fact  carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire  my dear cousin  I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so  Lady Catherine s great attentions to Mrs  Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be silent  Only let me assure you  my dear Miss Elizabeth  that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage  My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking  There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us  We seem to have been designed for each other 
But 
you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them  with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here 
Good gracious!
it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!
A great many indeed 
We have dined nine times at Rosings  besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!
And how much I shall have to conceal!
Is not this nice  Is not this an agreeable surprise 
And we mean to treat you all 
but you must lend us the money  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there 
Look here  I have bought this bonnet  I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not  I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home  and see if I can make it up any better 
Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh  I think it will be very tolerable  Besides  it will not much signify what one wears this summer  after the ——shire have left Meryton  and they are going in a fortnight 
Are they indeed!
They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all  Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!
Yes 
that would be a delightful scheme indeed  and completely do for us at once  Good Heaven! Brighton  and a whole campful of soldiers  to us  who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia  and the monthly balls of Meryton!
Now I have got some news for you 
What do you think  It is excellent news—capital news—and about a certain person we all like!
Aye  that is just like your formality and discretion  You thought the waiter must not hear  as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say  But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone  I never saw such a long chin in my life  Well  but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter  is it not  There is no danger of Wickham s marrying Mary King  There s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay  Wickham is safe 
And Mary King is safe!
safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune 
She is a great fool for going away  if she liked him 
But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side 
I am sure there is not on his  I will answer for it  he never cared three straws about her—who could about such a nasty little freckled thing 
How nicely we are all crammed in 
I am glad I bought my bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well  now let us be quite comfortable and snug  and talk and laugh all the way home  And in the first place  let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away  Have you seen any pleasant men  Have you had any flirting  I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back  Jane will be quite an old maid soon  I declare  She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord  how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands  you can t think  She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr  Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it  Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls  Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster s  Kitty and me were to spend the day there  and Mrs  Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening;  by the bye  Mrs  Forster and me are such friends!  and so she asked the two Harringtons to come  but Harriet was ill  and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then  what do you think we did  We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady  only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it  but Colonel and Mrs  Forster  and Kitty and me  except my aunt  for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny  and Wickham  and Pratt  and two or three more of the men came in  they did not know him in the least  Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs  Forster  I thought I should have died  And that made the men suspect something  and then they soon found out what was the matter 
I am glad you are come back  Lizzy 
Oh! Mary 
I wish you had gone with us  for we had such fun! As we went along  Kitty and I drew up the blinds  and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way  if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George  I do think we behaved very handsomely  for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world  and if you would have gone  we would have treated you too  And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach  I was ready to die of laughter  And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud  that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!
Far be it from me  my dear sister  to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds  But I confess they would have no charms for me—I should infinitely prefer a book 
His being so sure of succeeding was wrong 
and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!
Indeed 
I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings  which will probably soon drive away his regard for me  You do not blame me  however  for refusing him 
Blame you! Oh  no 
But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham 
No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did 
But you will know it  when I tell you what happened the very next day 
This will not do 
you never will be able to make both of them good for anything  Take your choice  but you must be satisfied with only one  There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much  For my part  I am inclined to believe it all Darcy s; but you shall do as you choose 
I do not know when I have been more shocked 
Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief  And poor Mr  Darcy! Dear Lizzy  only consider what he must have suffered  Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion  too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing  I am sure you must feel it so 
Oh! no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both  I know you will do him such ample justice  that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent  Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer  my heart will be as light as a feather 
Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!
There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men  One has got all the goodness  and the other all the appearance of it 
I never thought Mr  Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do 
And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him  without any reason  It is such a spur to one s genius  such an opening for wit  to have a dislike of that kind  One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty 
Lizzy  when you first read that letter  I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now 
Indeed  I could not  I was uncomfortable enough  I may say unhappy  And with no one to speak to about what I felt  no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!
How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr  Darcy  for now they do appear wholly undeserved 
Certainly  But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging  There is one point on which I want your advice  I want to be told whether I ought  or ought not  to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham s character 
Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully  What is your opinion 
That it ought not to be attempted  Mr  Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public  On the contrary  every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct  who will believe me  The general prejudice against Mr  Darcy is so violent  that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light  I am not equal to it  Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is  Some time hence it will be all found out  and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before  At present I will say nothing about it 
You are quite right  To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever  He is now  perhaps  sorry for what he has done  and anxious to re-establish a character  We must not make him desperate 
And then 
if that very improbable event should ever take place  I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself  The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!
Well  Lizzy 
what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane s  For my part  I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody  I told my sister Phillips so the other day  But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London  Well  he is a very undeserving young man—and I do not suppose there s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now  There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody  too  who is likely to know 
I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more 
Oh well! it is just as he chooses  Nobody wants him to come  Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her  I would not have put up with it  Well  my comfort is  I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done 
Well  Lizzy 
and so the Collinses live very comfortable  do they  Well  well  I only hope it will last  And what sort of table do they keep  Charlotte is an excellent manager  I dare say  If she is half as sharp as her mother  she is saving enough  There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping  I dare say 
No  nothing at all 
A great deal of good management  depend upon it  Yes  yes  they will take care not to outrun their income  They will never be distressed for money  Well  much good may it do them! And so  I suppose  they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead  They look upon it as quite their own  I dare say  whenever that happens 
It was a subject which they could not mention before me 
No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves  Well  if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own  so much the better  I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me 
Good Heaven! what is to become of us  What are we to do 
How can you be smiling so  Lizzy 
I am sure 
I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller s regiment went away  I thought I should have broken my heart 
I am sure I shall break mine 
If one could but go to Brighton!
Oh  yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable 
A little sea-bathing would set me up forever 
And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good 
I cannot see why Mrs  Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia 
Though I am not her particular friend  I have just as much right to be asked as she has  and more too  for I am two years older 
Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other  and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances 
If you were aware 
of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia s unguarded and imprudent manner—nay  which has already arisen from it  I am sure you would judge differently in the affair 
Already arisen 
What  has she frightened away some of your lovers  Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down  Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret  Come  let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia s folly 
Indeed you are mistaken  I have no such injuries to resent  It is not of particular  but of general evils  which I am now complaining  Our importance  our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility  the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia s character  Excuse me  for I must speak plainly  If you  my dear father  will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits  and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life  she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment  Her character will be fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt  too  in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and  from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind  wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite  In this danger Kitty also is comprehended  She will follow wherever Lydia leads  Vain  ignorant  idle  and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father  can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known  and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace 
Do not make yourself uneasy  my love  Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say  three—very silly sisters  We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton  Let her go  then  Colonel Forster is a sensible man  and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody  At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here  The officers will find women better worth their notice  Let us hope  therefore  that her being there may teach her her own insignificance  At any rate  she cannot grow many degrees worse  without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life 
How long did you say he was at Rosings 
Nearly three weeks 
And you saw him frequently 
Yes  almost every day 
His manners are very different from his cousin s 
Yes  very different  But I think Mr  Darcy improves upon acquaintance 
Indeed!
And pray  may I ask —
Is it in address that he improves  Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style —for I dare not hope 
that he is improved in essentials 
Oh  no!
In essentials  I believe  he is very much what he ever was 
When I said that he improved on acquaintance  I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement  but that  from knowing him better  his disposition was better understood 
You  who so well know my feeling towards Mr  Darcy  will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right  His pride  in that direction  may be of service  if not to himself  to many others  for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by  I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you  I imagine  have been alluding  is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt  of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe  His fear of her has always operated  I know  when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh  which I am certain he has very much at heart 
But it is fortunate 
that I have something to wish for  Were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment would be certain  But here  by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister s absence  I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised  A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation 
But surely 
I may enter his county with impunity  and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me 
My love  should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much 
a place  too  with which so many of your acquaintances are connected  Wickham passed all his youth there  you know 
If it were merely a fine house richly furnished 
I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful  They have some of the finest woods in the country 
And of this place 
I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger  I might have rejoiced in them as my own  and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt  But no 
that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them 
But we expect him to-morrow  with a large party of friends 
He is now gone into the army 
but I am afraid he has turned out very wild 
And that 
is my master—and very like him  It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago 
I have heard much of your master s fine person 
it is a handsome face  But  Lizzy  you can tell us whether it is like or not 
Does that young lady know Mr  Darcy 
A little 
And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma am 
Yes  very handsome 
I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer  larger picture of him than this  This room was my late master s favourite room  and these miniatures are just as they used to be then  He was very fond of them 
And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother 
Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long  In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him 
Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year 
Not so much as I could wish  sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months 
Except 
when she goes to Ramsgate 
If your master would marry  you might see more of him 
Yes  sir; but I do not know when that will be  I do not know who is good enough for him 
It is very much to his credit  I am sure  that you should think so 
I say no more than the truth  and everybody will say that knows him 
I have never known a cross word from him in my life  and I have known him ever since he was four years old 
There are very few people of whom so much can be said  You are lucky in having such a master 
Yes  sir  I know I am  If I were to go through the world  I could not meet with a better  But I have always observed  that they who are good-natured when children  are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered  most generous-hearted boy in the world 
Can this be Mr  Darcy 
His father was an excellent man 
Yes  ma am  that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the poor 
He is the best landlord  and the best master 
that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays  who think of nothing but themselves  There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name  Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it  To my fancy  it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men 
In what an amiable light does this place him!
This fine account of him 
is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend 
Perhaps we might be deceived 
That is not very likely; our authority was too good 
He is certainly a good brother 
And this is always the way with him 
Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment  There is nothing he would not do for her 
delightful 
charming 
What will be his surprise 
when he knows who they are  He takes them now for people of fashion 
Why is he so altered  From what can it proceed  It cannot be for me—it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened  My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this  It is impossible that he should still love me 
for your housekeeper 
informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed  before we left Bakewell  we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country 
They will join me early to-morrow 
and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you—Mr  Bingley and his sisters 
There is also one other person in the party 
who more particularly wishes to be known to you  Will you allow me  or do I ask too much  to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton 
He is perfectly well behaved  polite  and unassuming 
There is something a little stately in him  to be sure 
but it is confined to his air  and is not unbecoming  I can now say with the housekeeper  that though some people may call him proud  I have seen nothing of it 
I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us  It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention  His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling 
To be sure  Lizzy 
he is not so handsome as Wickham; or  rather  he has not Wickham s countenance  for his features are perfectly good  But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable 
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities 
Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word  as he might change his mind another day  and warn me off his grounds 
From what we have seen of him 
I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham  He has not an ill-natured look  On the contrary  there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks  And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart  But  to be sure  the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes  But he is a liberal master  I suppose  and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue 
was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;
It is above eight months  We have not met since the 26th of November  when we were all dancing together at Netherfield 
Pray  Miss Eliza  are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton  They must be a great loss to your family 
How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning  Mr  Darcy 
I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter  She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again 
For my own part 
I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her  Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome  Her nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines  Her teeth are tolerable  but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes  which have sometimes been called so fine  I could never see anything extraordinary in them  They have a sharp  shrewish look  which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion  which is intolerable 
I remember  when we first knew her in Hertfordshire  how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night  after they had been dining at Netherfield   She a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit   But afterwards she seemed to improve on you  and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time 
Yes 
but that was only when I first saw her  for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance 
Since writing the above  dearest Lizzy  something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well  What I have to say relates to poor Lydia  An express came at twelve last night  just as we were all gone to bed  from Colonel Forster  to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth  with Wickham! Imagine our surprise  To Kitty  however  it does not seem so wholly unexpected  I am very  very sorry  So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best  and that his character has been misunderstood  Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him  but this step  and let us rejoice over it  marks nothing bad at heart  His choice is disinterested at least  for he must know my father can give her nothing  Our poor mother is sadly grieved  My father bears it better  How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves  They were off Saturday night about twelve  as is conjectured  but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight  The express was sent off directly  My dear Lizzy  they must have passed within ten miles of us  Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon  Lydia left a few lines for his wife  informing her of their intention  I must conclude  for I cannot be long from my poor mother  I am afraid you will not be able to make it out  but I hardly know what I have written 
By this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible  but though not confined for time  my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent  Dearest Lizzy  I hardly know what I would write  but I have bad news for you  and it cannot be delayed  Imprudent as the marriage between Mr  Wickham and our poor Lydia would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place  for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland  Colonel Forster came yesterday  having left Brighton the day before  not many hours after the express  Though Lydia s short letter to Mrs  F  gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green  something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W  never intended to go there  or to marry Lydia at all  which was repeated to Colonel F   who  instantly taking the alarm  set off from B  intending to trace their route  He did trace them easily to Clapham  but no further; for on entering that place  they removed into a hackney coach  and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom  All that is known after this is  that they were seen to continue the London road  I know not what to think  After making every possible inquiry on that side London  Colonel F  came on into Hertfordshire  anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes  and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield  but without any success—no such people had been seen to pass through  With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn  and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart  I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs  F   but no one can throw any blame on them  Our distress  my dear Lizzy  is very great  My father and mother believe the worst  but I cannot think so ill of him  Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia s connections  which is not likely  can I suppose her so lost to everything  Impossible! I grieve to find  however  that Colonel F  is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes  and said he feared W  was not a man to be trusted  My poor mother is really ill  and keeps her room  Could she exert herself  it would be better; but this is not to be expected  And as to my father  I never in my life saw him so affected  Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence  one cannot wonder  I am truly glad  dearest Lizzy  that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now  as the first shock is over  shall I own that I long for your return  I am not so selfish  however  as to press for it  if inconvenient  Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible  I know my dear uncle and aunt so well  that I am not afraid of requesting it  though I have still something more to ask of the former  My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly  to try to discover her  What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way  and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening  In such an exigence  my uncle s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel  and I rely upon his goodness 
Oh! where  where is my uncle 
I beg your pardon  but I must leave you  I must find Mr  Gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose 
Good God! what is the matter 
I will not detain you a minute; but let me  or let the servant go after Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner  You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself 
Let me call your maid  Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief  A glass of wine; shall I get you one  You are very ill 
No  I thank you 
There is nothing the matter with me  I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn 
I have just had a letter from Jane  with such dreadful news  It cannot be concealed from anyone  My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr  Wickham  They are gone off together from Brighton  You know him too well to doubt the rest  She has no money  no connections  nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever 
When I consider 
that I might have prevented it! I  who knew what he was  Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt  to my own family! Had his character been known  this could not have happened  But it is all—all too late now 
I am grieved indeed 
grieved—shocked  But is it certain—absolutely certain 
Oh  yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night  and were traced almost to London  but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland 
And what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover her 
My father is gone to London  and Jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance; and we shall be off  I hope  in half-an-hour  But nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done  How is such a man to be worked on  How are they even to be discovered  I have not the smallest hope  It is every way horrible!
When my eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I known what I ought  what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much  Wretched  wretched mistake!
I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence  nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay  but real  though unavailing concern  Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes  which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks  This unfortunate affair will  I fear  prevent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day 
Oh  yes  Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy  Say that urgent business calls us home immediately  Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible  I know it cannot be long 
But what is to be done about Pemberley 
John told us Mr  Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so 
Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement  That is all settled 
What is all settled 
And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth  Oh  that I knew how it was!
I have been thinking it over again  Elizabeth 
and really  upon serious consideration  I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter  It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless  and who was actually staying in his colonel s family  that I am strongly inclined to hope the best  Could he expect that her friends would not step forward  Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment  after such an affront to Colonel Forster  His temptation is not adequate to the risk!
Do you really think so 
Upon my word 
I begin to be of your uncle s opinion  It is really too great a violation of decency  honour  and interest  for him to be guilty of  I cannot think so very ill of Wickham  Can you yourself  Lizzy  so wholly give him up  as to believe him capable of it 
Not  perhaps  of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable  If  indeed  it should be so! But I dare not hope it  Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case 
In the first place 
there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland 
Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And  besides  no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road 
Well  then—supposing them to be in London  They may be there  though for the purpose of concealment  for no more exceptional purpose  It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically  though less expeditiously  married in London than in Scotland 
But why all this secrecy  Why any fear of detection  Why must their marriage be private  Oh  no  no—this is not likely  His most particular friend  you see by Jane s account  was persuaded of his never intending to marry her  Wickham will never marry a woman without some money  He cannot afford it  And what claims has Lydia—what attraction has she beyond youth  health  and good humour that could make him  for her sake  forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well  As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her  I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce  But as to your other objection  I am afraid it will hardly hold good  Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine  from my father s behaviour  from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family  that he would do as little  and think as little about it  as any father could do  in such a matter 
But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage 
It does seem  and it is most shocking indeed 
that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt  But  really  I know not what to say  Perhaps I am not doing her justice  But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year  nay  for a twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity  She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner  and to adopt any opinions that came in her way  Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton  nothing but love  flirtation  and officers have been in her head  She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject  to give greater—what shall I call it  susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough  And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman 
But you see that Jane 
does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt 
Of whom does Jane ever think ill  And who is there  whatever might be their former conduct  that she would think capable of such an attempt  till it were proved against them  But Jane knows  as well as I do  what Wickham really is  We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating 
And do you really know all this 
I do indeed 
I told you  the other day  of his infamous behaviour to Mr  Darcy; and you yourself  when last at Longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him  And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless  From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud  reserved  disagreeable girl  Yet he knew to the contrary himself  He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her 
But does Lydia know nothing of this  can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand 
Oh  yes!—that  that is the worst of all  Till I was in Kent  and saw so much both of Mr  Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam  I was ignorant of the truth myself  And when I returned home  the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight s time  As that was the case  neither Jane  to whom I related the whole  nor I  thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one  that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown  And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs  Forster  the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me  That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head  That such a consequence as this could ensue  you may easily believe  was far enough from my thoughts 
When they all removed to Brighton  therefore  you had no reason  I suppose  to believe them fond of each other 
Not the slightest  I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible  you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away  When first he entered the corps  she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were  Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the regiment  who treated her with more distinction  again became her favourites 
Not yet 
But now that my dear uncle is come  I hope everything will be well 
Is my father in town 
Yes  he went on Tuesday  as I wrote you word 
And have you heard from him often 
We have heard only twice  He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety  and to give me his directions  which I particularly begged him to do  He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention 
And my mother—how is she  How are you all 
My mother is tolerably well  I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken  She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all  She does not yet leave her dressing-room  Mary and Kitty  thank Heaven  are quite well 
But you—how are you 
You look pale  How much you must have gone through!
If I had been able 
to carry my point in going to Brighton  with all my family  this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her  Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight  I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side  for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after  I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled  as I always am  Poor dear child! And now here s Mr  Bennet gone away  and I know he will fight Wickham  wherever he meets him and then he will be killed  and what is to become of us all  The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave  and if you are not kind to us  brother  I do not know what we shall do 
Do not give way to useless alarm 
though it is right to be prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it as certain  It is not quite a week since they left Brighton  In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married  and have no design of marrying  do not let us give the matter over as lost  As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother  and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done 
Oh! my dear brother 
that is exactly what I could most wish for  And now do  when you get to town  find them out  wherever they may be; and if they are not married already  make them marry  And as for wedding clothes  do not let them wait for that  but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them  after they are married  And  above all  keep Mr  Bennet from fighting  Tell him what a dreadful state I am in  that I am frighted out of my wits—and have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me—such spasms in my side and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that I can get no rest by night nor by day  And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me  for she does not know which are the best warehouses  Oh  brother  how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all 
This is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much talked of  But we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation 
Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia  we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex 
But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard  Give me further particulars  What did Colonel Forster say  Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place  They must have seen them together for ever 
Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality  especially on Lydia s side  but nothing to give him any alarm  I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost  He was coming to us  in order to assure us of his concern  before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad  it hastened his journey 
And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry  Did he know of their intending to go off  Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself 
Yes; but  when questioned by him  Denny denied knowing anything of their plans  and would not give his real opinion about it  He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that  I am inclined to hope  he might have been misunderstood before 
And till Colonel Forster came himself  not one of you entertained a doubt  I suppose  of their being really married 
How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains  I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage  because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right  My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be  Kitty then owned  with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us  that in Lydia s last letter she had prepared her for such a step  She had known  it seems  of their being in love with each other  many weeks 
But not before they went to Brighton 
No  I believe not 
And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself  Does he know his real character 
I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did  He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant  And since this sad affair has taken place  it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false 
Oh  Jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of him  this could not have happened!
Perhaps it would have been better 
But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were  seemed unjustifiable  We acted with the best intentions 
Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia s note to his wife 
He brought it with him for us to see 
    cried Elizabeth when she had finished it  
   cried Elizabeth  
     cried Elizabeth; 
 She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue  while in town  for the recovery of his daughter    replied Jane  
     Chapter 48  The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr  Bennet the next morning  but the post came in without bringing a single line from him  His family knew him to be  on all common occasions  a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion  They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain  Mr  Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off   When he was gone  they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on  and their uncle promised  at parting  to prevail on Mr  Bennet to return to Longbourn  as soon as he could  to the great consolation of his sister  who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a duel   Mrs  Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer  as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces  She shared in their attendance on Mrs  Bennet  and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom  Their other aunt also visited them frequently  and always  as she said  with the design of cheering and heartening them up—though  as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham s extravagance or irregularity  she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them   All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who  but three months before  had been almost an angel of light  He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place  and his intrigues  all honoured with the title of seduction  had been extended into every tradesman s family  Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness  Elizabeth  though she did not credit above half of what was said  believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister s ruin more certain; and even Jane  who believed still less of it  became almost hopeless  more especially as the time was now come when  if they had gone to Scotland  which she had never before entirely despaired of  they must in all probability have gained some news of them   Mr  Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that  on his arrival  he had immediately found out his brother  and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr  Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham  before his arrival  but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town  as Mr  Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them  on their first coming to London  before they procured lodgings  Mr  Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure  but as his brother was eager in it  he meant to assist him in pursuing it  He added that Mr  Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon  There was also a postscript to this effect:   Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved  She had never heard of his having had any relations  except a father and mother  both of whom had been dead many years  It was possible  however  that some of his companions in the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it  the application was a something to look forward to   Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected  The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning s impatience  Through letters  whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated  and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance   But before they heard again from Mr  Gardiner  a letter arrived for their father  from a different quarter  from Mr  Collins; which  as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence  she accordingly read; and Elizabeth  who knew what curiosities his letters always were  looked over her  and read it likewise  It was as follows:    Mr  Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send  It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection  and it was certain that he had no near one living  His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia  it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them  There was no one  therefore  who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him  And in the wretched state of his own finances  there was a very powerful motive for secrecy  in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia s relations  for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount  Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton  He owed a good deal in town  but his debts of honour were still more formidable  Mr  Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family  Jane heard them with horror   she cried  
 Mr  Gardiner added in his letter  that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day  which was Saturday  Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours  he had yielded to his brother-in-law s entreaty that he would return to his family  and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit  When Mrs  Bennet was told of this  she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected  considering what her anxiety for his life had been before    she cried  
 As Mrs  Gardiner began to wish to be at home  it was settled that she and the children should go to London  at the same time that Mr  Bennet came from it  The coach  therefore  took them the first stage of their journey  and brought its master back to Longbourn   Mrs  Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world  His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs  Gardiner had formed  of their being followed by a letter from him  had ended in nothing  Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley   The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing  therefore  could be fairly conjectured from that  though Elizabeth  who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings  was perfectly aware that  had she known nothing of Darcy  she could have borne the dread of Lydia s infamy somewhat better  It would have spared her  she thought  one sleepless night out of two   When Mr  Bennet arrived  he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure  He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away  and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it   It was not till the afternoon  when he had joined them at tea  that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then  on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured  he replied         said her father drily; 
 Then after a short silence he continued:   They were interrupted by Miss Bennet  who came to fetch her mother s tea    he cried  
  said Kitty fretfully  
  Kitty  who took all these threats in a serious light  began to cry    said he  
     Chapter 49  Two days after Mr  Bennet s return  as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house  they saw the housekeeper coming towards them  and  concluding that she came to call them to their mother  went forward to meet her; but  instead of the expected summons  when they approached her  she said to Miss Bennet     cried Mrs  Hill  in great astonishment  
 Away ran the girls  too eager to get in to have time for speech  They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother  when they were met by the butler  who said:   Upon this information  they instantly passed through the hall once more  and ran across the lawn after their father  who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock   Jane  who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth  soon lagged behind  while her sister  panting for breath  came up with him  and eagerly cried out:      said he  taking the letter from his pocket  
 Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand  Jane now came up    said their father  
    cried Jane; 
 Elizabeth read on:  EDW  GARDINER 
Is it possible 
Can it be possible that he will marry her 
Wickham is not so undeserving  then  as we thought him 
My dear father  I congratulate you 
And have you answered the letter 
No; but it must be done soon 
Oh! my dear father 
come back and write immediately  Consider how important every moment is in such a case 
Let me write for you 
if you dislike the trouble yourself 
I dislike it very much 
but it must be done 
And may I ask—
but the terms  I suppose  must be complied with 
Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little 
And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!
Yes  yes  they must marry  There is nothing else to be done  But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is  how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other  how am I ever to pay him 
Money! My uncle!
what do you mean  sir 
I mean  that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life  and fifty after I am gone 
That is very true 
though it had not occurred to me before  His debts to be discharged  and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle s doings! Generous  good man  I am afraid he has distressed himself  A small sum could not do all this 
No 
Wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds  I should be sorry to think so ill of him  in the very beginning of our relationship 
Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid 
And they are really to be married!
How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful  That they should marry  small as is their chance of happiness  and wretched as is his character  we are forced to rejoice  Oh  Lydia!
I comfort myself with thinking 
that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her  Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him  I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds  or anything like it  has been advanced  He has children of his own  and may have more  How could he spare half ten thousand pounds 
If he were ever able to learn what Wickham s debts have been 
and how much is settled on his side on our sister  we shall exactly know what Mr  Gardiner has done for them  because Wickham has not sixpence of his own  The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited  Their taking her home  and affording her their personal protection and countenance  is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge  By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now  she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her  when she first sees my aunt!
We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side 
I hope and trust they will yet be happy  His consenting to marry her is a proof  I will believe  that he is come to a right way of thinking  Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly  and live in so rational a manner  as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten 
Their conduct has been such 
as neither you  nor I  nor anybody can ever forget  It is useless to talk of it 
Just as you please 
May we take my uncle s letter to read to her 
Take whatever you like  and get away 
My dear  dear Lydia!
This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good  kind brother! I knew how it would be  I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes  the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly  Lizzy  my dear  run down to your father  and ask him how much he will give her  Stay  stay  I will go myself  Ring the bell  Kitty  for Hill  I will put on my things in a moment  My dear  dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!
For we must attribute this happy conclusion 
in a great measure to his kindness  We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr  Wickham with money 
Well 
it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle  If he had not had a family of his own  I and my children must have had all his money  you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him  except a few presents  Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married  Mrs  Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June  My dear Jane  I am in such a flutter  that I am sure I can t write; so I will dictate  and you write for me  We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately 
I will go to Meryton 
as soon as I am dressed  and tell the good  good news to my sister Philips  And as I come back  I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs  Long  Kitty  run down and order the carriage  An airing would do me a great deal of good  I am sure  Girls  can I do anything for you in Meryton  Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill  have you heard the good news  Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding 
Haye Park might do 
if the Gouldings could quit it—or the great house at Stoke  if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge  the attics are dreadful 
Mrs  Bennet  before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter  let us come to a right understanding  Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance  I will not encourage the impudence of either  by receiving them at Longbourn 
It was greatly my wish that he should do so 
  Mr  Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham s removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr  Gardiner could do  But Mrs  Bennet was not so well pleased with it  Lydia s being settled in the North  just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company  for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire  was a severe disappointment; and  besides  it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody  and had so many favourites    said she  
 His daughter s request  for such it might be considered  of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North  received at first an absolute negative  But Jane and Elizabeth  who agreed in wishing  for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence  that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents  urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly  to receive her and her husband at Longbourn  as soon as they were married  that he was prevailed on to think as they thought  and act as they wished  And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North  When Mr  Bennet wrote again to his brother  therefore  he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled  that as soon as the ceremony was over  they should proceed to Longbourn  Elizabeth was surprised  however  that Wickham should consent to such a scheme  and had she consulted only her own inclination  any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes       Chapter 51  Their sister s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself  The carriage was sent to meet them at ——  and they were to return in it by dinner-time  Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets  and Jane more especially  who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself  had she been the culprit  and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure   They came  The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them  Smiles decked the face of Mrs  Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters  alarmed  anxious  uneasy   Lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open  and she ran into the room  Her mother stepped forwards  embraced her  and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand  with an affectionate smile  to Wickham  who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness   Their reception from Mr  Bennet  to whom they then turned  was not quite so cordial  His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips  The easy assurance of the young couple  indeed  was enough to provoke him  Elizabeth was disgusted  and even Miss Bennet was shocked  Lydia was Lydia still; untamed  unabashed  wild  noisy  and fearless  She turned from sister to sister  demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down  looked eagerly round the room  took notice of some little alteration in it  and observed  with a laugh  that it was a great while since she had been there   Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself  but his manners were always so pleasing  that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought  his smiles and his easy address  while he claimed their relationship  would have delighted them all  Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down  resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man  She blushed  and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour   There was no want of discourse  The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham  who happened to sit near Elizabeth  began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood  with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies  They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world  Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world    she cried  
 Her father lifted up his eyes  Jane was distressed  Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she  who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible  gaily continued   Elizabeth could bear it no longer  She got up  and ran out of the room; and returned no more  till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour  She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia  with anxious parade  walk up to her mother s right hand  and hear her say to her eldest sister   It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first  Her ease and good spirits increased  She longed to see Mrs  Phillips  the Lucases  and all their other neighbours  and to hear herself called   said she  when they were all returned to the breakfast room  
      said Elizabeth; 
 Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them  Mr  Wickham had received his commission before he left London  and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight   No one but Mrs  Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter  and having very frequent parties at home  These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think  than such as did not   Wickham s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia s for him  She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied  from the reason of things  that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love  rather than by his; and she would have wondered why  without violently caring for her  he chose to elope with her at all  had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion   Lydia was exceedingly fond of him  He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him  He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September  than any body else in the country   One morning  soon after their arrival  as she was sitting with her two elder sisters  she said to Elizabeth:    replied Elizabeth; 
      said Jane  
  said Elizabeth  though burning with curiosity; 
  said Lydia  
 On such encouragement to ask  Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power  by running away   But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information  Mr  Darcy had been at her sister s wedding  It was exactly a scene  and exactly among people  where he had apparently least to do  and least temptation to go  Conjectures as to the meaning of it  rapid and wild  hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none  Those that best pleased her  as placing his conduct in the noblest light  seemed most improbable  She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper  wrote a short letter to her aunt  to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended    she added  
  she added to herself  as she finished the letter; 
 Jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction  she had rather be without a confidante       Chapter 52  Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could  She was no sooner in possession of it than  hurrying into the little copse  where she was least likely to be interrupted  she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial             The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits  in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share  The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr  Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister s match  which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable  and at the same time dreaded to be just  from the pain of obligation  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town  he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise  and where he was reduced to meet  frequently meet  reason with  persuade  and finally bribe  the man whom he always most wished to avoid  and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce  He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem  Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her  But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations  and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient  when required to depend on his affection for her—for a woman who had already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham  Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection  He had  to be sure  done much  She was ashamed to think how much  But he had given a reason for his interference  which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief  It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality  and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement  she could  perhaps  believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned  It was painful  exceedingly painful  to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return  They owed the restoration of Lydia  her character  every thing  to him  Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged  every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him  For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him  Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour  he had been able to get the better of himself  She read over her aunt s commendation of him again and again  It was hardly enough; but it pleased her  She was even sensible of some pleasure  though mixed with regret  on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr  Darcy and herself   She was roused from her seat  and her reflections  by some one s approach; and before she could strike into another path  she was overtaken by Wickham     she replied with a smile; 
    She replied in the affirmative          said Elizabeth  
                They were now almost at the door of the house  for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling  for her sister s sake  to provoke him  she only said in reply  with a good-humoured smile:   She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry  though he hardly knew how to look  and they entered the house       Chapter 53  Mr  Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself  or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth  by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet   The day of his and Lydia s departure soon came  and Mrs  Bennet was forced to submit to a separation  which  as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle  was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth    she cried  
    Mr  Wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s  He smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things    said Mr  Bennet  as soon as they were out of the house  
 The loss of her daughter made Mrs  Bennet very dull for several days    said she  
  said Elizabeth  
  But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved  and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope  by an article of news which then began to be in circulation  The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master  who was coming down in a day or two  to shoot there for several weeks  Mrs  Bennet was quite in the fidgets  She looked at Jane  and smiled and shook her head by turns     for Mrs  Phillips first brought her the news   
  replied the other  
 Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour  It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now  as soon as they were alone together  she said:   Elizabeth did not know what to make of it  Had she not seen him in Derbyshire  she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane  and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission  or being bold enough to come without it    she sometimes thought  
 In spite of what her sister declared  and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival  Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it  They were more disturbed  more unequal  than she had often seen them   The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents  about a twelvemonth ago  was now brought forward again    said Mrs  Bennet  
  His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen  on his returning to Netherfield    said he  
  Consoled by this resolution  she was the better able to bear her husband s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr  Bingley  in consequence of it  before they did  As the day of his arrival drew near —   said Jane to her sister  
  replied Elizabeth; 
 Mr  Bingley arrived  Mrs  Bennet  through the assistance of servants  contrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could  She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before  But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire  she saw him  from her dressing-room window  enter the paddock and ride towards the house   Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy  Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth  to satisfy her mother  went to the window—she looked —she saw Mr  Darcy with him  and sat down again by her sister    said Kitty; 
   replied Kitty  
  Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern  She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire  and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister  in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter  Both sisters were uncomfortable enough  Each felt for the other  and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on  of her dislike of Mr  Darcy  and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr  Bingley s friend  without being heard by either of them  But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs  Gardiner s letter  or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him  To Jane  he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused  and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information  he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits  and whom she regarded herself with an interest  if not quite so tender  at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley  Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield  to Longbourn  and voluntarily seeking her again  was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire   The colour which had been driven from her face  returned for half a minute with an additional glow  and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes  as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken  But she would not be secure    said she; 
 She sat intently at work  striving to be composed  and without daring to lift up her eyes  till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door  Jane looked a little paler than usual  but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected  On the gentlemen s appearing  her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease  and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance   Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow  and sat down again to her work  with an eagerness which it did not often command  She had ventured only one glance at Darcy  He looked serious  as usual; and  she thought  more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire  than as she had seen him at Pemberley  But  perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt  It was a painful  but not an improbable  conjecture   Bingley  she had likewise seen for an instant  and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed  He was received by Mrs  Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed  especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend   Elizabeth  particularly  who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy  was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied   Darcy  after inquiring of her how Mr  and Mrs  Gardiner did  a question which she could not answer without confusion  said scarcely anything  He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire  There he had talked to her friends  when he could not to herself  But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally  unable to resist the impulse of curiosity  she raised her eyes to his face  she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself  and frequently on no object but the ground  More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please  than when they last met  were plainly expressed  She was disappointed  and angry with herself for being so    said she  
 She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak   She inquired after his sister  but could do no more    He readily agreed to it    Bingley replied that he did  and made his congratulations  Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes  How Mr  Darcy looked  therefore  she could not tell    continued her mother  
 Elizabeth  who knew this to be levelled at Mr  Darcy  was in such misery of shame  that she could hardly keep her seat  It drew from her  however  the exertion of speaking  which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present  A few weeks  he believed    said her mother  
 Elizabeth s misery increased  at such unnecessary  such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago  every thing  she was persuaded  would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion  At that instant  she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion    said she to herself  
 Yet the misery  for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation  received soon afterwards material relief  from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover  When first he came in  he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention  He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured  and as unaffected  though not quite so chatty  Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all  and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever  But her mind was so busily engaged  that she did not always know when she was silent   When the gentlemen rose to go away  Mrs  Bennet was mindful of her intended civility  and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time    she added  
 Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection  and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business  They then went away   Mrs  Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but  though she always kept a very good table  she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs  or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year       Chapter 54  As soon as they were gone  Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words  to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more  Mr  Darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her    said she  
 She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure    Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister  who joined her with a cheerful look  which showed her better satisfied with their visitors  than Elizabeth    said she  
  said Elizabeth  laughingly  
   They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs  Bennet  in the meanwhile  was giving way to all the happy schemes  which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley  in half an hour s visit  had revived   On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected  to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen  were in very good time  When they repaired to the dining-room  Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place  which  in all their former parties  had belonged to him  by her sister  Her prudent mother  occupied by the same ideas  forbore to invite him to sit by herself  On entering the room  he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round  and happened to smile: it was decided  He placed himself by her   Elizabeth  with a triumphant sensation  looked towards his friend  He bore it with noble indifference  and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy  had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr  Darcy  with an expression of half-laughing alarm   His behaviour to her sister was such  during dinner time  as showed an admiration of her  which  though more guarded than formerly  persuaded Elizabeth  that if left wholly to himself  Jane s happiness  and his own  would be speedily secured  Though she dared not depend upon the consequence  she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour  It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour  Mr  Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them  He was on one side of her mother  She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either  or make either appear to advantage  She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse  but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other  and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did  Her mother s ungraciousness  made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth s mind; and she would  at times  have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family   She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance  Anxious and uneasy  the period which passed in the drawing-room  before the gentlemen came  was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil  She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend    said she  
 The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but  alas! the ladies had crowded round the table  where Miss Bennet was making tea  and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee  in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair  And on the gentlemen s approaching  one of the girls moved closer to her than ever  and said  in a whisper:   Darcy had walked away to another part of the room  She followed him with her eyes  envied everyone to whom he spoke  had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!   She was a little revived  however  by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:      She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her  he might have better success  He stood by her  however  for some minutes  in silence; and  at last  on the young lady s whispering to Elizabeth again  he walked away   When the tea-things were removed  and the card-tables placed  the ladies all rose  and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him  when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players  and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party  She now lost every expectation of pleasure  They were confined for the evening at different tables  and she had nothing to hope  but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room  as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself   Mrs  Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others  and she had no opportunity of detaining them    said she  as soon as they were left to themselves  
 Mrs  Bennet  in short  was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley s behaviour to Jane  to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family  when in a happy humour  were so far beyond reason  that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day  to make his proposals    said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth  
 Elizabeth smiled     said her sister  
         Chapter 55  A few days after this visit  Mr  Bingley called again  and alone  His friend had left him that morning for London  but was to return home in ten days time  He sat with them above an hour  and was in remarkably good spirits  Mrs  Bennet invited him to dine with them; but  with many expressions of concern  he confessed himself engaged elsewhere    said she  
 He should be particularly happy at any time  etc  etc ; and if she would give him leave  would take an early opportunity of waiting on them    Yes  he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity   He came  and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed  In ran Mrs  Bennet to her daughter s room  in her dressing gown  and with her hair half finished  crying out:    said Jane; 
  But when her mother was gone  Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters   The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening  After tea  Mr  Bennet retired to the library  as was his custom  and Mary went up stairs to her instrument  Two obstacles of the five being thus removed  Mrs  Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time  without making any impression on them  Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did  she very innocently said    She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion  she suddenly got up  and saying to Kitty  
  Elizabeth was forced to go    said her mother  as soon as she was in the hall  
 Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother  but remained quietly in the hall  till she and Kitty were out of sight  then returned into the drawing-room   Mrs  Bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual  Bingley was every thing that was charming  except the professed lover of her daughter  His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother  and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter   He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away  an engagement was formed  chiefly through his own and Mrs  Bennet s means  for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband   After this day  Jane said no more of her indifference  Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded  unless Mr  Darcy returned within the stated time  Seriously  however  she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s concurrence   Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr  Bennet spent the morning together  as had been agreed on  The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected  There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule  or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative  and less eccentric  than the other had ever seen him  Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs  Bennet s invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter  Elizabeth  who had a letter to write  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards  she could not be wanted to counteract her mother s schemes   But on returning to the drawing-room  when her letter was finished  she saw  to her infinite surprise  there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her  On opening the door  she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth  as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion  the faces of both  as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other  would have told it all  Their situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse  Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again  when Bingley  who as well as the other had sat down  suddenly rose  and whispering a few words to her sister  ran out of the room   Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth  where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her  acknowledged  with the liveliest emotion  that she was the happiest creature in the world    she added  
 Elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity  a warmth  a delight  which words could but poorly express  Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane  But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister  or say half that remained to be said for the present    she cried  
 She then hastened away to her mother  who had purposely broken up the card party  and was sitting up stairs with Kitty   Elizabeth  who was left by herself  now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled  that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation    said she  
 In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley  whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose     He then shut the door  and  coming up to her  claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister  Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship  They shook hands with great cordiality; and then  till her sister came down  she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness  and of Jane s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover  Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded  because they had for basis the excellent understanding  and super-excellent disposition of Jane  and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself   It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face  as made her look handsomer than ever  Kitty simpered and smiled  and hoped her turn was coming soon  Mrs  Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings  though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr  Bennet joined them at supper  his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was   Not a word  however  passed his lips in allusion to it  till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone  he turned to his daughter  and said:   Jane went to him instantly  kissed him  and thanked him for his goodness    he replied  
   cried his wife  
 Then addressing her daughter  
 Wickham  Lydia  were all forgotten  Jane was beyond competition her favourite child  At that moment  she cared for no other  Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense   Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter   Bingley  from this time  was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast  and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour  who could not be enough detested  had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept   Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present  Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur  In the absence of Jane  he always attached himself to Elizabeth  for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone  Jane constantly sought the same means of relief    said she  one evening  
  replied Elizabeth  
   said Elizabeth  
   This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence  and the little value he put on his own good qualities  Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for  though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world  she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him    cried Jane  
  The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret  Mrs  Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs  Phillips  and she ventured  without any permission  to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton   The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world  though only a few weeks before  when Lydia had first run away  they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune       Chapter 56  One morning  about a week after Bingley s engagement with Jane had been formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room  their attention was suddenly drawn to the window  by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn  It was too early in the morning for visitors  and besides  the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours  The horses were post; and neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who preceded it  were familiar to them  As it was certain  however  that somebody was coming  Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion  and walk away with him into the shrubbery  They both set off  and the conjectures of the remaining three continued  though with little satisfaction  till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered  It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh   They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs  Bennet and Kitty  though she was perfectly unknown to them  even inferior to what Elizabeth felt   She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious  made no other reply to Elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head  and sat down without saying a word  Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance  though no request of introduction had been made   Mrs  Bennet  all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of such high importance  received her with the utmost politeness  After sitting for a moment in silence  she said very stiffly to Elizabeth    Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was     said Mrs  Bennet  delighted to speak to Lady Catherine  
    Mrs  Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner  and then added:    Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling  But no letter appeared  and she was completely puzzled   Mrs  Bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely  and not very politely  declined eating anything; and then  rising up  said to Elizabeth     cried her mother  
 Elizabeth obeyed  and running into her own room for her parasol  attended her noble guest downstairs  As they passed through the hall  Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room  and pronouncing them  after a short survey  to be decent looking rooms  walked on   Her carriage remained at the door  and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it  They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable    As soon as they entered the copse  Lady Catherine began in the following manner:—   Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment     replied her ladyship  in an angry tone  
  said Elizabeth  colouring with astonishment and disdain  
   said Elizabeth coolly  
             Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied:      replied Elizabeth  
       said Elizabeth  
  Though Elizabeth would not  for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine  have answered this question  she could not but say  after a moment s deliberation:   Lady Catherine seemed pleased         she resentfully answered  
 And she rose as she spoke  Lady Catherine rose also  and they turned back  Her ladyship was highly incensed         replied Elizabeth  
  In this manner Lady Catherine talked on  till they were at the door of the carriage  when  turning hastily round  she added   Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it herself  She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs  Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room  to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself    said her daughter  
  Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible       Chapter 57  The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome; nor could she  for many hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly  Lady Catherine  it appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings  for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr  Darcy  It was a rational scheme  to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate  Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley  and her being the sister of Jane  was enough  at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another  to supply the idea  She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together  And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge  therefore  for through their communication with the Collinses  the report  she concluded  had reached Lady Catherine   had only set that down as almost certain and immediate  which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time   In revolving Lady Catherine s expressions  however  she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference  From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage  it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her  she dared not pronounce  She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt  or his dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain that  in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one  whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own  his aunt would address him on his weakest side  With his notions of dignity  he would probably feel that the arguments  which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous  contained much good sense and solid reasoning   If he had been wavering before as to what he should do  which had often seemed likely  the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt  and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him  In that case he would return no more  Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way    she added  
 The surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their visitor had been  was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it  with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs  Bennet s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject   The next morning  as she was going downstairs  she was met by her father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand    said he  
 She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held  It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations   She followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat down  He then said    The colour now rushed into Elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew  instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all  or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued:       Elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry  but could only force one most reluctant smile  Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her       cried Elizabeth  
  To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion  she was not distressed by his repeating it  Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not  It was necessary to laugh  when she would rather have cried  Her father had most cruelly mortified her  by what he said of Mr  Darcy s indifference  and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of his seeing too little  she might have fancied too much       Chapter 58  Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend  as Elizabeth half expected Mr  Bingley to do  he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine s visit  The gentlemen arrived early; and  before Mrs  Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt  of which her daughter sat in momentary dread  Bingley  who wanted to be alone with Jane  proposed their all walking out  It was agreed to  Mrs  Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together  Bingley and Jane  however  soon allowed the others to outstrip them  They lagged behind  while Elizabeth  Kitty  and Darcy were to entertain each other  Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same   They walked towards the Lucases  because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern  when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone  Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed  and  while her courage was high  she immediately said:    replied Darcy  in a tone of surprise and emotion  
   he replied  
 Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word  After a short pause  her companion added   Elizabeth  feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation  now forced herself to speak; and immediately  though not very fluently  gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change  since the period to which he alluded  as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances  The happiness which this reply produced  was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do  Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight  diffused over his face  became him; but  though she could not look  she could listen  and he told her of feelings  which  in proving of what importance she was to him  made his affection every moment more valuable   They walked on  without knowing in what direction  There was too much to be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any other objects  She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt  who did call on him in her return through London  and there relate her journey to Longbourn  its motive  and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which  in her ladyship s apprehension  peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give  But  unluckily for her ladyship  its effect had been exactly contrariwise    said he  
 Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied     said Elizabeth  
     Darcy mentioned his letter   said he  
 She explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed    said he  
   replied Darcy  
           replied Darcy  
 He then told her of Georgiana s delight in her acquaintance  and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn  and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend   She expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a subject to each  to be dwelt on farther   After walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy to know anything about it  they found at last  on examining their watches  that it was time to be at home        said he  
 Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend    said she  
    Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr  Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself  She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at  and it was rather too early to begin  In anticipating the happiness of Bingley  which of course was to be inferior only to his own  he continued the conversation till they reached the house  In the hall they parted       Chapter 59   The evening passed quietly  unmarked by anything extraordinary  The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged were silent  Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for  besides the immediate embarrassment  there were other evils before her  She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away   At night she opened her heart to Jane  Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet s general habits  she was absolutely incredulous here     Jane looked at her doubtingly    Miss Bennet still looked all amazement  Elizabeth again  and more seriously assured her of its truth    cried Jane  
        Another entreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment  When convinced on that article  Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish    said she  
 Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy  She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend  But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia s marriage  All was acknowledged  and half the night spent in conversation    cried Mrs  Bennet  as she stood at a window the next morning  
 Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet   As soon as they entered  Bingley looked at her so expressively  and shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud    said Mrs  Bennet  
  replied Mr  Bingley; 
  During their walk  it was resolved that Mr  Bennet s consent should be asked in the course of the evening  Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s  She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man  But whether she were violently set against the match  or violently delighted with it  it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr  Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy  than the first vehemence of her disapprobation   In the evening  soon after Mr  Bennet withdrew to the library  she saw Mr  Darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on seeing it was extreme  She did not fear her father s opposition  but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means—that she  his favourite child  should be distressing him by her choice  should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection  and she sat in misery till Mr  Darcy appeared again  when  looking at him  she was a little relieved by his smile  In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and  while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper   Her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious   said he  
 How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable  her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary  and she assured him  with some confusion  of her attachment to Mr  Darcy     said Elizabeth  
   she replied  with tears in her eyes  
  said her father  
 Elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length  by repeated assurances that Mr  Darcy was really the object of her choice  by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone  relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day  but had stood the test of many months  suspense  and enumerating with energy all his good qualities  she did conquer her father s incredulity  and reconcile him to the match    said he  when she ceased speaking  
 To complete the favourable impression  she then told him what Mr  Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia  He heard her with astonishment    He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before  on his reading Mr  Collins s letter; and after laughing at her some time  allowed her at last to go—saying  as she quitted the room   Elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and  after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room  she was able to join the others with tolerable composure  Every thing was too recent for gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded  and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time   When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night  she followed her  and made the important communication  Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it  Mrs  Bennet sat quite still  and unable to utter a syllable  Nor was it under many  many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them  She began at length to recover  to fidget about in her chair  get up  sit down again  wonder  and bless herself    This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself  soon went away  But before she had been three minutes in her own room  her mother followed her    she cried  
 This was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that  though in the certain possession of his warmest affection  and secure of her relations  consent  there was still something to be wished for  But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs  Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him  unless it was in her power to offer him any attention  or mark her deference for his opinion   Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr  Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem    said he  
     Chapter 60  Elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again  she wanted Mr  Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her   said she  
                   From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr  Darcy had been over-rated  Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs  Gardiner s long letter; but now  having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome  she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness  and immediately wrote as follows:   Mr  Darcy s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr  Bennet sent to Mr  Collins  in reply to his last     Miss Bingley s congratulations to her brother  on his approaching marriage  were all that was affectionate and insincere  She wrote even to Jane on the occasion  to express her delight  and repeat all her former professions of regard  Jane was not deceived  but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her  could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved   The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information  was as sincere as her brother s in sending it  Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight  and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister   Before any answer could arrive from Mr  Collins  or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife  the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge  The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident  Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter  that Charlotte  really rejoicing in the match  was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over  At such a moment  the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth  though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought  when she saw Mr  Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband  He bore it  however  with admirable calmness  He could even listen to Sir William Lucas  when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country  and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St  James s  with very decent composure  If he did shrug his shoulders  it was not till Sir William was out of sight   Mrs  Phillips s vulgarity was another  and perhaps a greater  tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs  Phillips  as well as her sister  stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley s good humour encouraged  yet  whenever she did speak  she must be vulgar  Nor was her respect for him  though it made her more quiet  at all likely to make her more elegant  Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either  and was ever anxious to keep him to herself  and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure  it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either  to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley       Chapter 61  Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs  Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters  With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs  Bingley  and talked of Mrs  Darcy  may be guessed  I wish I could say  for the sake of her family  that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible  amiable  well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband  who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form  that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly   Mr  Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do  He delighted in going to Pemberley  especially when he was least expected   Mr  Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth  So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper  or her affectionate heart  The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire  and Jane and Elizabeth  in addition to every other source of happiness  were within thirty miles of each other   Kitty  to her very material advantage  spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters  In society so superior to what she had generally known  her improvement was great  She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and  removed from the influence of Lydia s example  she became  by proper attention and management  less irritable  less ignorant  and less insipid  From the further disadvantage of Lydia s society she was of course carefully kept  and though Mrs  Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her  with the promise of balls and young men  her father would never consent to her going   Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs  Bennet s being quite unable to sit alone  Mary was obliged to mix more with the world  but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters  beauty and her own  it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance   As for Wickham and Lydia  their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters  He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing  was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune  The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage  explained to her that  by his wife at least  if not by himself  such a hope was cherished  The letter was to this effect:    As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not  she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind  Such relief  however  as it was in her power to afford  by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences  she frequently sent them  It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs  under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants  and heedless of the future  must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters  either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills  Their manner of living  even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home  was unsettled in the extreme  They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation  and always spending more than they ought  His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners  she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her   Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley  yet  for Elizabeth s sake  he assisted him further in his profession  Lydia was occasionally a visitor there  when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long  that even Bingley s good humour was overcome  and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone   Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley  she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana  almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore  and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth   Pemberley was now Georgiana s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see  They were able to love each other even as well as they intended  Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively  sportive  manner of talking to her brother  He  who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection  she now saw the object of open pleasantry  Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way  By Elizabeth s instructions  she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself   Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement  she sent him language so very abusive  especially of Elizabeth  that for some time all intercourse was at an end  But at length  by Elizabeth s persuasion  he was prevailed on to overlook the offence  and seek a reconciliation; and  after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt  her resentment gave way  either to her affection for him  or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley  in spite of that pollution which its woods had received  not merely from the presence of such a mistress  but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city   With the Gardiners  they were always on the most intimate terms  Darcy  as well as Elizabeth  really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who  by bringing her into Derbyshire  had been the means of uniting them

Yes  he would give them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make them completely easy  Three thousand pounds! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience 
It was my father s last request to me 
that I should assist his widow and daughters 
[7] begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child He did not stipulate for any particular sum  my dear Fanny; he only requested me  in general terms  to assist them  and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do  Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself  He could hardly suppose I should neglect them  But as he required the promise  I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time  The promise  therefore  was given  and must be performed  Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home 
Well  then  let something be done for them; but that something need not be three thousand pounds  Consider 
that when the money is once parted with  it never can return  Your sisters will marry  and it will be gone for ever  If  indeed  it could be restored to our poor little boy—
Why  to be sure 
that would make great difference  The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with  If he should have a numerous family  for instance  it would be a very convenient addition 
To be sure it would 
Perhaps  then  it would be better for all parties  if the sum were diminished one half  Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!
Oh! beyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters  even if really his sisters! And as it is—only half blood! But you have such a generous spirit!
I would not wish to do any thing mean 
One had rather  on such occasions  do too much than too little  No one  at least  can think I have not done enough for them: even themselves  they can hardly expect more 
There is no knowing what they may expect 
but we are not to think of their expectations: the question is  what you can afford to do 
[8] their mother s death—a very comfortable fortune for any young woman To be sure it is; and  indeed  it strikes me that they can want no addition at all  They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them  If they marry  they will be sure of doing well  and if they do not  they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds 
That is very true  and  therefore  I do not know whether  upon the whole  it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives  rather than for them—something of the annuity kind I mean  My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself  A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable 
To be sure 
it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once  But  then  if Mrs  Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in 
Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that purchase 
Certainly not; but if you observe  people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy  and hardly forty  An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over and over every year  and there is no getting rid of it  You are not aware of what you are doing  I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father s will  and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it  Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one of them was said to have died  and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing  My mother was quite sick of it  Her income was not her own  she said  with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father  because  otherwise  the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal  without any restriction whatever  It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities  that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world 
It is certainly an unpleasant thing 
[9] fortune  as your mother justly says  is not one s own  To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum  on every rent day  is by no means desirable: it takes away one s independence Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it  They think themselves secure  you do no more than what is expected  and it raises no gratitude at all  If I were you  whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely  I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly  It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred  or even fifty pounds from our own expenses 
I believe you are right  my love; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance  because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income  and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year  It will certainly be much the best way  A present of fifty pounds  now and then  will prevent their ever being distressed for money  and will  I think  be amply discharging my promise to my father 
[10] conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them more  it is quite absurd to think of it  They will be much more able to give you something Upon my word 
I believe you are perfectly right  My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say  I clearly understand it now  and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described  When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can  Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then 
Certainly 
But  however  one thing must be considered  When your father and mother moved to Norland  though the furniture of Stanhill was sold  all the china  plate  and linen was saved  and is now left to your mother  Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it 
That is a material consideration undoubtedly  A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here 
Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house  A great deal too handsome  in my opinion  for any place they can ever afford to live in  But  however  so it is  Your father thought only of them And I must say this: that you owe no particular gratitude to him  nor attention to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could  he would have left almost everything in the world to them 
I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it 
I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it 
It is enough 
to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough  It implies everything amiable  I love him already 
I think you will like him 
when you know more of him 
Like him!
I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love 
You may esteem him 
I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love 
In a few months  my dear Marianne 
Elinor will  in all probability be settled for life  We shall miss her; but she will be happy 
Oh! Mamma  how shall we do without her 
My love  it will be scarcely a separation  We shall live within a few miles of each other  and shall meet every day of our lives  You will gain a brother—a real  affectionate brother  I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward s heart  But you look grave  Marianne; do you disapprove your sister s choice 
Perhaps 
[15] my sister  His eyes want all that spirit  that fire  which at once announce virtue and intelligence  And besides all this  I am afraid  Mamma  he has no real taste  Music seems scarcely to attract him  and though he admires Elinor s drawings very much  it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth  It is evident  in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws  that in fact he knows nothing of the matter  He admires as a lover  not as a connoisseur  To satisfy me  those characters must be united  I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own  He must enter into all my feelings; the same books  the same music must charm us both  Oh! mama  how spiritless  how tame was Edward s manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely  Yet she bore it with so much composure  she seemed scarcely to notice it  I could hardly keep my seat  To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild  pronounced with such impenetrable calmness  such dreadful indifference!He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose  I thought so at the time; but you would give him Cowper 
Nay  Mamma  if he is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allow for difference of taste  Elinor has not my feelings  and therefore she may overlook it  and be happy with him  But it would have broke my heart  had I loved him  to hear him read with so little sensibility  Mama  the more I know of the world  the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love  I require so much! He must have all Edward s virtues  and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm 
Remember  my love  that you are not seventeen  It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness  Why should you be less fortunate than your mother  In one circumstance only  my Marianne  may your destiny be different from her s!
What a pity it is  Elinor 
that Edward should have no taste for drawing 
No taste for drawing!
why should you think so  He does not draw himself  indeed  but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people  and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste  though he has not had opportunities of improving it  Had he ever been in the way of learning  I think he would have drawn very well  He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much  that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste  which in general direct him perfectly right 
I hope  Marianne 
you do not consider him as deficient in general taste  Indeed  I think I may say that you cannot  for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial  and if that were your opinion  I am sure you could never be civil to him 
Do not be offended  Elinor  if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits  I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind  his inclinations and tastes  as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense  I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable 
I am sure 
[17] that  I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly Of his sense and his goodness 
no one can  I think  be in doubt  who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation  The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent  You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth  But of his minuter propensities  as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself  He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together  while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother  I have seen a great deal of him  have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and  upon the whole  I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed  enjoyment of books exceedingly great  his imagination lively  his observation just and correct  and his taste delicate and pure  His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person  At first sight  his address is certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome  till the expression of his eyes  which are uncommonly good  and the general sweetness of his countenance  is perceived  At present  I know him so well  that I think him really handsome; or at least  almost so  What say you  Marianne 
I shall very soon think him handsome  Elinor  if I do not now  When you tell me to love him as a brother  I shall no more see imperfection in his face  than I now do in his heart 
I do not attempt to deny 
that I think very highly of him—that I greatly esteem  that I like him 
Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise  Use those words again  and I will leave the room this moment 
Excuse me 
and be assured that I meant no offence to you  by speaking  in so quiet a way  of my own feelings  Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them  in short  to be such as his merit  and the suspicion—the hope—of his affection for me may warrant  without imprudence or folly  But farther than this you must not believe  I am by no means assured of his regard for me  There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known  you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality  by believing or calling it more than it is  In my heart I feel little—scarcely any doubt of his preference  But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination  He is very far from being independent  What his mother really is we cannot know; but  from Fanny s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions  we have never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way  if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank 
And you really are not engaged to him!
Yet it certainly soon will happen  But two advantages will proceed from this delay  I shall not lose you so soon  and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity  Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself  how delightful it would be!
Devonshire! Are you  indeed  going there  So far from hence! And to what part of it 
It is but a cottage 
but I hope to see many of my friends in it  A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me  I am sure I will find none in accommodating them 
Dear  dear Norland!
when shall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere! Oh! happy house  could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot  from whence perhaps I may view you no more! And you  ye well-known trees!—but you will continue the same  No leaf will decay because we are removed  nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer! No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion  and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade! But who will remain to enjoy you 
As for the house itself  to be sure 
it is too small for our family  but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present  as it is too late in the year for improvements  Perhaps in the spring  if I have plenty of money  as I dare say I shall  we may think about building  These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other  and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this  with a new drawing room which may be easily added  and a bed-chamber and garret above  will make it a very snug little cottage  I could wish the stairs were handsome  But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them  I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring  and we will plan our improvements accordingly 
But at least  Mamma  you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation  though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured  Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs  Jennings  but he is old enough to be my father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love  must have long outlived every sensation of the kind  It is too ridiculous! When is a man to be safe from such wit  if age and infirmity will not protect him 
Infirmity!
do you call Colonel Brandon infirm  I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!
Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism  and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life 
My dearest child 
at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty 
Mamma  you are not doing me justice  I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature  He may live twenty years longer  But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony 
Perhaps 
thirty-five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together  But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty  I should not think Colonel Brandon s being thirty-five any objection to his marrying her  
A woman of seven and twenty 
can never hope to feel or inspire affection again  and if her home be uncomfortable  or her fortune small  I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse  for the sake of the provision and security of a wife  In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable  It would be a compact of convenience  and the world would be satisfied  In my eyes it would be no marriage at all  but that would be nothing  To me it would seem only a commercial exchange  in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other 
It would be impossible  I know 
to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love  to make him a desirable companion to her  But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber  merely because he chanced to complain yesterday  a very cold damp day  of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders 
But he talked of flannel waistcoats 
and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches  cramps  rheumatisms  and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble 
Had he been only in a violent fever  you would not have despised him half so much  Confess  Marianne  is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek  hollow eye  and quick pulse of a fever 
Mamma 
I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal from you  I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well  We have now been here almost a fortnight  and yet he does not come  Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay  What else can detain him at Norland 
Had you any idea of his coming so soon 
I had none  On the contrary  if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject  it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation  when I talked of his coming to Barton  Does Elinor expect him already 
I have never mentioned it to her  but of course she must 
I rather think you are mistaken  for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed-chamber  she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it  as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time 
[34] brother to both  Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning  and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room  And Elinor  in quitting Norland and Edward  cried not as I did  Even now her self-command is invariable  When is she dejected or melancholy  When does she try to avoid society  or appear restless and dissatisfied in it Is there a felicity in the world 
superior to this —Margaret  we will walk here at least two hours 
Willoughby!
what  is he in the country  That is good news however; I will ride over tomorrow  and ask him to dinner on Thursday 
You know him then 
Know him! to be sure I do  Why  he is down here every year 
And what sort of a young man is he 
As good a kind of fellow as ever lived  I assure you  A very decent shot  and there is not a bolder rider in England 
And is that all you can say for him 
But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance  What his pursuits  his talents  and genius 
Upon my soul 
I do not know much about him as to all that  But he is a pleasant  good humoured fellow  and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw  Was she out with him today 
But who is he 
Where does he come from  Has he a house at Allenham 
[38] Somersetshire besides; and if I were you  I would not give him up to my younger sister  in spite of all this tumbling down hills  Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself  Brandon will be jealous  if she does not take care I do not believe 
that Mr  Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him  It is not an employment to which they have been brought up  Men are very safe with us  let them be ever so rich  I am glad to find  however  from what you say  that he is a respectable young man  and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible 
He is as good a sort of fellow  I believe  as ever lived 
I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park  he danced from eight o clock till four  without once sitting down 
Did he indeed 
and with elegance  with spirit 
Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert 
That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be  Whatever be his pursuits  his eagerness in them should know no moderation  and leave him no sense of fatigue 
Aye  aye  I see how it will be 
I see how it will be  You will be setting your cap at him now  and never think of poor Brandon 
That is an expression  Sir John 
which I particularly dislike  I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and  setting one s cap at a man   or  making a conquest   are the most odious of all  Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever  time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity 
Ay  you will make conquests enough  I dare say  one way or other  Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already  and he is very well worth setting your cap at  I can tell you  in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles 
Well  Marianne 
for one morning I think you have done pretty well  You have already ascertained Mr  Willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance  You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought  and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper  But how is your acquaintance to be long supported  under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse  You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic  Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty  and second marriages  and then you can have nothing farther to ask 
Elinor 
is this fair  is this just  are my ideas so scanty  But I see what you mean  I have been too much at my ease  too happy  too frank  I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved  spiritless  dull  and deceitful:—had I talked only of the weather and the roads  and had I spoken only once in ten minutes  this reproach would have been spared 
My love 
you must not be offended with Elinor—she was only in jest  I should scold her myself  if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend 
Brandon is just the kind of man 
whom every body speaks well of  and nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see  and nobody remembers to talk to 
That is exactly what I think of him 
Do not boast of it  however 
for it is injustice in both of you  He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park  and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him 
That he is patronised by you 
[44] Mrs  Jennings  that could command the indifference of any body else But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother  If their praise is censure  your censure may be praise  for they are not more undiscerning  than you are prejudiced and unjust 
In defence of your protégé you can even be saucy 
My protégé  as you call him  is a sensible man; and sense will always have attractions for me  Yes  Marianne  even in a man between thirty and forty  He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad  has read  and has a thinking mind  I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature 
That is to say 
he has told you  that in the East Indies the climate is hot  and the mosquitoes are troublesome 
He would have told me so  I doubt not  had I made any such inquiries  but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed 
Perhaps 
his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs  gold mohrs  and palanquins 
I may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your candour  But why should you dislike him 
I do not dislike him  I consider him  on the contrary  as a very respectable man  who has every body s good word  and nobody s notice; who  has more money than he can spend  more time than he knows how to employ  and two new coats every year 
Add to which 
that he has neither genius  taste  nor spirit  That his understanding has no brilliancy  his feelings no ardour  and his voice no expression 
You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass 
and so much on the strength of your own imagination  that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid  I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man  well-bred  well-informed  of gentle address  and  I believe  possessing an amiable heart 
Miss Dashwood 
you are now using me unkindly  You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason  and to convince me against my will  But it will not do  You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful  I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle  and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare  If it will be any satisfaction to you  however  to be told  that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable  I am ready to confess it  And in return for an acknowledgment  which must give me some pain  you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever 
Your sister  I understand  does not approve of second attachments 
No 
her opinions are all romantic 
Or rather  as I believe  she considers them impossible to exist 
[48] and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are  by any body but herself This will probably be the case 
and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind  that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions 
I cannot agree with you there 
There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne s  which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for  Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage 
Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment  or is it equally criminal in every body  Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice  whether from the inconstancy of its object  or the perverseness of circumstances  to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives 
Upon my word  I am not acquainted with the minutiæ of her principles  I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment s being pardonable 
This 
cannot hold; but a change  a total change of sentiments—No  no  do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way  how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common  and too dangerous! I speak from experience  I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister  who thought and judged like her  but who from an enforced change—from a series of unfortunate circumstances—
He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it 
and when it arrives we will ride every day  You shall share its use with me  Imagine to yourself  my dear Elinor  the delight of a gallop on some of these downs 
You are mistaken  Elinor 
[50] with any other creature in the world  except yourself and mama  It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy; it is disposition alone  Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other  and seven days are more than enough for others  I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother  than from Willoughby  Of John I know very little  though we have lived together for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed But  Marianne  the horse is still yours  though you cannot use it now  I shall keep it only till you can claim it  When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home  Queen Mab shall receive you 
Oh  Elinor!
I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne  I am sure she will be married to Mr  Willoughby very soon 
You have said so 
almost every day since they first met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week  I believe  before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle 
But indeed this is quite another thing  I am sure they will be married very soon  for he has got a lock of her hair 
Take care  Margaret  It may be only the hair of some great uncle of his 
But  indeed  Elinor  it is Marianne s  I am almost sure it is  for I saw him cut it off  Last night after tea  when you and mama went out of the room  they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be  and he seemed to be begging something of her  and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair  for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it  and folded it up in a piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book 
I must not tell  may I  Elinor 
Remember that whatever your conjectures may be  you have no right to repeat them 
I never had any conjectures about it 
it was you who told me of it yourself 
Oh! pray  Miss Margaret  let us know all about it 
What is the gentleman s name 
I must not tell  ma am  But I know very well what it is; and I know where he is too 
Yes  yes  we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be sure  He is the curate of the parish I dare say 
No  that he is not  He is of no profession at all 
Margaret 
you know that all this is an invention of your own  and that there is no such person in existence 
Well  then  he is lately dead  Marianne  for I am sure there was such a man once  and his name begins with an F 
that it rained very hard 
What is the matter with Brandon 
I hope he has had no bad news 
It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly 
No bad news  Colonel  I hope;
None at all  ma am  I thank you 
Was it from Avignon  I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse 
No  ma am  It came from town  and is merely a letter of business 
But how came the hand to discompose you so much  if it was only a letter of business  Come  come  this won t do  Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it 
My dear madam 
recollect what you are saying 
Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married 
No  indeed  it is not 
Well  then  I know who it is from  Colonel  And I hope she is well 
Whom do you mean  ma am 
Oh! you know who I mean 
I am particularly sorry  ma am 
that I should receive this letter today  for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town 
In town!
What can you have to do in town at this time of year 
My own loss is great 
in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned  as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell 
But if you write a note to the housekeeper  Mr  Brandon 
will it not be sufficient 
We must go 
It shall not be put off when we are so near it  You cannot go to town till tomorrow  Brandon  that is all 
I wish it could be so easily settled  But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!
If you would but let us know what your business is 
we might see whether it could be put off or not 
You would not be six hours later 
if you were to defer your journey till our return 
I cannot afford to lose one hour 
There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure  Brandon is one of them  He was afraid of catching cold I dare say  and invented this trick for getting out of it  I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing 
I have no doubt of it 
There is no persuading you to change your mind  Brandon  I know of old 
when once you are determined on anything  But  however  I hope you will think better of it  Consider  here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton  the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage  and Mr  Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time  on purpose to go to Whitwell 
Well  then  when will you come back again 
I hope we shall see you at Barton 
as soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return 
You are very obliging  But it is so uncertain  when I may have it in my power to return  that I dare not engage for it at all 
Oh! he must and shall come back 
If he is not here by the end of the week  I shall go after him 
Ay  so do  Sir John 
and then perhaps you may find out what his business is 
I do not want to pry into other men s concerns  I suppose it is something he is ashamed of 
You do not go to town on horseback  do you 
No  Only to Honiton  I shall then go post 
Well  as you are resolved to go  I wish you a good journey  But you had better change your mind 
I assure you it is not in my power 
Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter  Miss Dashwood 
I am afraid  none at all 
Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do 
Come Colonel 
before you go  do let us know what you are going about 
I can guess what his business is  however 
Can you  ma am 
Yes; it is about Miss Williams  I am sure 
And who is Miss Williams 
What! do not you know who Miss Williams is  I am sure you must have heard of her before  She is a relation of the Colonel s  my dear; a very near relation  We will not say how near  for fear of shocking the young ladies 
She is his natural daughter 
Indeed!
Oh  yes; and as like him as she can stare  I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune 
I have found you out in spite of all your tricks  I know where you spent the morning 
Where  pray 
Did not you know 
that we had been out in my curricle 
Yes  yes  Mr  Impudence  I know that very well  and I was determined to find out where you had been to  I hope you like your house  Miss Marianne  It is a very large one  I know; and when I come to see you  I hope you will have new-furnished it  for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago 
Why should you imagine  Elinor  that we did not go there  or that we did not see the house  Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself 
Yes  Marianne  but I would not go while Mrs  Smith was there  and with no other companion than Mr  Willoughby 
I have found you out in spite of all your tricks 
I have found you out in spite of all your tricks 
[60] carriage  it was impossible to have any other companion  I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life I am afraid 
that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety 
On the contrary  nothing can be a stronger proof of it  Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did  I should have been sensible of it at the time  for we always know when we are acting wrong  and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure 
But  my dear Marianne  as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks  do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct 
If the impertinent remarks of Mrs  Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct  we are all offending every moment of our lives  I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation  I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs  Smith s grounds  or in seeing her house  They will one day be Mr  Willoughby s  and—
If they were one day to be your own  Marianne  you would not be justified in what you have done 
Perhaps  Elinor  it was rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr  Willoughby wanted particularly to show me the place; and it is a charming house  I assure you  There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use  and with modern furniture it would be delightful  It is a corner room  and has windows on two sides  On one side you look across the bowling-green  behind the house  to a beautiful hanging wood  and on the other you have a view of the church and village  and  beyond them  of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired  I did not see it to advantage  for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture; but if it were newly fitted up—a couple of hundred pounds  Willoughby says  would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England 
Something very melancholy must be the matter  I am sure 
I could see it in his face  Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad  The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year  and his brother left everything sadly involved  I do think he must have been sent for about money matters  for what else can it be  I wonder whether it is so  I would give anything to know the truth of it  Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and  by the bye  I dare say it is  because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her  May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely  for I have a notion she is always rather sickly  I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams  It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances now  for he is a very prudent man  and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time  I wonder what it can be! May be his sister is worse at Avignon  and has sent for him over  His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it  Well  I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart  and a good wife into the bargain 
What!
[63] That I will never consent to  Not a stone must be added to its walls  not an inch to its size  if my feelings are regarded Do not be alarmed 
nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it 
I am heartily glad of it 
May she always be poor  if she can employ her riches no better 
Thank you  Willoughby  But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours  or of any one whom I loved  for all the improvements in the world  Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain  when I make up my accounts in the spring  I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you  But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it 
I am 
To me it is faultless  Nay  more  I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable  and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down  and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage 
With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes  I suppose 
Yes 
with all and every thing belonging to it—in no one convenience or inconvenience about it  should the least variation be perceptible  Then  and then only  under such a roof  I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton 
I flatter myself 
that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase  you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this 
There certainly are circumstances 
which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of my affection  which no other can possibly share 
How often did I wish 
[64] little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs  Smith  when I next came into the country  would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event  which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it  can account for  Must it not have been so  Marianne And yet this house you would spoil  Mrs  Dashwood  You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began  and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together  you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance  and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford 
You are a good woman 
Your promise makes me easy  Extend it a little farther  and it will make me happy  Tell me that not only your house will remain the same  but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me 
Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner 
I do not ask you to come in the morning  for we must walk to the park  to call on Lady Middleton 
Is anything the matter with her 
is she ill 
I hope not 
It is I who may rather expect to be ill—for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!
Disappointment 
Yes  for I am unable to keep my engagement with you  Mrs  Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin  by sending me on business to London  I have just received my dispatches  and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you 
To London!—and are you going this morning 
Almost this moment 
This is very unfortunate  But Mrs  Smith must be obliged  and her business will not detain you from us long I hope 
You are very kind  but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately  My visits to Mrs  Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth 
And is Mrs  Smith your only friend  Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome  For shame  Willoughby  can you wait for an invitation here 
You are too good 
I have only to add  my dear Willoughby  that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here immediately  because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to Mrs  Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination 
My engagements at present 
are of such a nature—that—I dare not flatter myself—
It is folly to linger in this manner  I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy 
Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton  Elinor 
and with how heavy a heart does he travel 
It is all very strange  So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work of a moment  And last night he was with us so happy  so cheerful  so affectionate  And now  after only ten minutes notice —gone too without intending to return! Something more than what he owned to us must have happened  He did not speak  he did not behave like himself  You must have seen the difference as well as I  What can it be  Can they have quarrelled  Why else should he have shown such unwillingness to accept your invitation here 
It was not inclination that he wanted  Elinor; I could plainly see that  He had not the power of accepting it  I have thought it all over I assure you  and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you 
Can you  indeed!
[69] him  This is what I believe to have happened  He is  moreover  aware that she does disapprove the connection  he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne  and he feels himself obliged  from his dependent situation  to give into her schemes  and absent himself from Devonshire for a while  You will tell me  I know  that this may or may not have happened; but I will listen to no cavil  unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this  And now  Elinor  what have you to say Nothing  for you have anticipated my answer 
Then you would have told me  that it might or might not have happened  Oh  Elinor  how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had rather take evil upon credit than good  You had rather look out for misery for Marianne  and guilt for poor Willoughby  than an apology for the latter  You are resolved to think him blamable  because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown  And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence  or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment  Are no probabilities to be accepted  merely because they are not certainties  Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love  and no reason in the world to think ill of —to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves  though unavoidably secret for a while  And  after all  what is it you suspect him of 
I can hardly tell myself  But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him  There is great truth  however  in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him  and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body  Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct  and I will hope that he has  But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once  Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him 
Do not blame him  however  for departing from his character  where the deviation is necessary  But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence —I am happy—and he is acquitted 
Not entirely  It may be proper to conceal their engagement  if they are engaged  from Mrs  Smith; and if that is the case  it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present  But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us 
Concealing it from us! my dear child  do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment  This is strange indeed  when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness 
I want no proof of their affection 
but of their engagement I do 
I am perfectly satisfied of both 
Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject  by either of them 
I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly  Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us  for at least the last fortnight  declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife  and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation  Have we not perfectly understood each other  Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks  his manner  his attentive and affectionate respect  My Elinor  is it possible to doubt their engagement  How could such a thought occur to you  How is it to be supposed that Willoughby  persuaded as he must be of your sister s love  should leave her  and leave her perhaps for months  without telling her of his affection —that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence 
I confess 
that every circumstance except one is in favour of their engagement; but that one is the total silence of both on the subject  and with me it almost outweighs every other 
How strange this is! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby  if  after all that has openly passed between them  you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together  Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time  Do you suppose him really indifferent to her 
No  I cannot think that  He must and does love her I am sure 
But with a strange kind of tenderness  if he can leave her with such indifference  such carelessness of the future  as you attribute to him 
You must remember  my dear mother  that I have never considered this matter as certain  I have had my doubts  I confess; but they are fainter than they were  and they may soon be entirely done away  If we find they correspond  every fear of mine will be removed 
A mighty concession indeed! If you were to see them at the altar  you would suppose they were going to be married  Ungracious girl! But I require no such proof  Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved  You cannot doubt your sister s wishes  It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect  But why  Is he not a man of honour and feeling  Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm  can he be deceitful 
I hope not  I believe not 
I love Willoughby  sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me  It has been involuntary  and I will not encourage it  I was startled  I confess  by the alteration in his manners this morning; he did not speak like himself  and did not return your kindness with any cordiality  But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed  He had just parted from my sister  had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction; and if he felt obliged  from a fear of offending Mrs  Smith  to resist the temptation of returning here soon  and yet aware that by declining your invitation  by saying that he was going away for some time  he should seem to act an ungenerous  a suspicious part by our family  he might well be embarrassed and disturbed  In such a case  a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think  as well as more consistent with his general character;—but I will not raise objections against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation  as a difference in judgment from myself  or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent 
[72] acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case  It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun  for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy  as far as it can be observed  may now be very advisable Remember  Elinor 
how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post  and carries them to it  We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary  and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John s hands 
Why do you not ask Marianne at once 
whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby  From you  her mother  and so kind  so indulgent a mother  the question could not give offence  It would be the natural result of your affection for her  She used to be all unreserve  and to you more especially 
I would not ask such a question for the world  Supposing it possible that they are not engaged  what distress would not such an enquiry inflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous  I should never deserve her confidence again  after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one  I know Marianne s heart: I know that she dearly loves me  and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known  when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible  I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct 
We have never finished Hamlet  Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it  We will put it by  that when he comes again—; But it may be months  perhaps  before that happens 
Months!
No—nor many weeks 
It is he; it is indeed—I know it is!
Indeed  Marianne  I think you are mistaken  It is not Willoughby  The person is not tall enough for him  and has not his air 
He has  he has 
I am sure he has  His air  his coat  his horse  I knew how soon he would come 
A fortnight!
Have you been lately in Sussex 
I was at Norland about a month ago 
And how does dear  dear Norland look 
Dear  dear Norland 
probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year—the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves 
Oh 
[78] feelings have they  the season  the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard them  They are seen only as a nuisance  swept hastily off  and driven as much as possible from the sight It is not every one 
who has your passion for dead leaves 
No; my feelings are not often shared  not often understood  But sometimes they are 
Now  Edward 
here is Barton valley  Look up to it  and be tranquil if you can  Look at those hills! Did you ever see their equals  To the left is Barton park  amongst those woods and plantations  You may see the end of the house  And there  beneath that farthest hill  which rises with such grandeur  is our cottage 
It is a beautiful country 
but these bottoms must be dirty in winter 
How can you think of dirt  with such objects before you 
Because 
among the rest of the objects before me  I see a very dirty lane 
How strange!
Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here  Are the Middletons pleasant people 
No  not all 
we could not be more unfortunately situated 
Marianne 
how can you say so  How can you be so unjust  They are a very respectable family  Mr  Ferrars; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner  Have you forgot  Marianne  how many pleasant days we have owed to them 
No 
nor how many painful moments 
What are Mrs  Ferrars s views for you at present  Edward 
are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself 
No  I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life!
But how is your fame to be established  for famous you must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense  no affection for strangers  no profession  and no assurance  you may find it a difficult matter 
I shall not attempt it  I have no wish to be distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall  Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence 
You have no ambition  I well know  Your wishes are all moderate 
As moderate as those of the rest of the world  I believe  I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but  like every body else it must be in my own way  Greatness will not make me so 
Strange that it would!
What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness 
Grandeur has but little 
but wealth has much to do with it 
Elinor  for shame!
money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it  Beyond a competence  it can afford no real satisfaction  as far as mere self is concerned 
Perhaps 
we may come to the same point  Your competence and my wealth are very much alike  I dare say; and without them  as the world goes now  we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting  Your ideas are only more noble than mine  Come  what is your competence 
About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than that 
Two thousand a year! One is my wealth! I guessed how it would end 
And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income 
A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller  I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands  A proper establishment of servants  a carriage  perhaps two  and hunters  cannot be supported on less 
Hunters!
but why must you have hunters  Every body does not hunt 
But most people do 
I wish 
that somebody would give us all a large fortune a-piece!
Oh that they would!
We are all unanimous in that wish  I suppose 
in spite of the insufficiency of wealth 
Oh dear!
how happy I should be! I wonder what I should do with it!
I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself 
if my children were all to be rich without my help 
You must begin your improvements on this house 
and your difficulties will soon vanish 
What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London 
in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers  music-sellers  and print-shops! You  Miss Dashwood  would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you—and as for Marianne  I know her greatness of soul  there would not be music enough in London to content her  And books!—Thomson  Cowper  Scott—she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy  I believe  to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree  Should not you  Marianne  Forgive me  if I am very saucy  But I was willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes 
I love to be reminded of the past  Edward—whether it be melancholy or gay  I love to recall it—and you will never offend me by talking of former times  You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent; some of it  at least—my loose cash—would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books 
And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs 
No  Edward  I should have something else to do with it 
Perhaps  then  you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim  that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life—for your opinion on that point is unchanged  I presume 
Undoubtedly  At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed  It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them 
Marianne is as steadfast as ever  you see 
she is not at all altered 
She is only grown a little more grave than she was 
Nay  Edward 
you need not reproach me  You are not very gay yourself 
Why should you think so!
But gaiety never was a part of my character 
Nor do I think it a part of Marianne s 
I should hardly call her a lively girl—she is very earnest  very eager in all she does—sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation—but she is not often really merry 
I believe you are right 
and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl 
I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes 
in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave  or ingenious or stupid than they really are  and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated  Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves  and very frequently by what other people say of them  without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge 
But I thought it was right  Elinor 
to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people  I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours  This has always been your doctrine  I am sure 
No  Marianne  never  My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding  All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour  You must not confound my meaning  I am guilty  I confess  of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters 
You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility 
Do you gain no ground 
Quite the contrary 
My judgment 
is all on your side of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister s  I never wish to offend  but I am so foolishly shy  that I often seem negligent  when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness  I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company  I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!
Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers 
She knows her own worth too well for false shame 
Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other  If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful  I should not be shy 
But you would still be reserved 
and that is worse 
Reserved! Am I reserved  Marianne 
Yes  very 
I do not understand you 
Reserved!—how  in what manner  What am I to tell you  What can you suppose 
Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means  Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast  and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself 
I am going into the village to see my horses 
as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently 
You must not enquire too far  Marianne: remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque  and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars  I shall call hills steep  which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth  which ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight  which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere  You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give  I call it a very fine country —the hills are steep  the woods seem full of fine timber  and the valley looks comfortable and snug —with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there  It exactly answers my idea of a fine country  because it unites beauty with utility—and I dare say it is a picturesque one too  because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories  grey moss and brush wood  but these are all lost on me  I know nothing of the picturesque 
I am afraid it is but too true 
but why should you boast of it 
I suspect 
[85] in viewing them himself than he possesses  He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own It is very true 
that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon  Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was  I detest jargon of every kind  and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself  because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning 
I am convinced 
that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel  But  in return  your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess  I like a fine prospect  but not on picturesque principles  I do not like crooked  twisted  blasted trees  I admire them much more if they are tall  straight  and flourishing  I do not like ruined  tattered cottages  I am not fond of nettles or thistles  or heath blossoms  I have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower —and a troop of tidy  happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world 
I never saw you wear a ring before  Edward 
Is that Fanny s hair  I remember her promising to give you some  But I should have thought her hair had been darker 
Yes; it is my sister s hair  The setting always casts a different shade on it  you know 
You must drink tea with us to night 
for we shall be quite alone; and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us  for we shall be a large party 
And who knows but you may raise a dance 
And that will tempt you  Miss Marianne 
A dance!
Impossible! Who is to dance 
[88] to be sure  What! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone!I wish with all my soul 
that Willoughby were among us again 
And who is Willoughby 
I have been guessing  Shall I tell you my guess 
What do you mean 
Shall I tell you 
Certainly 
Well then; I guess that Mr  Willoughby hunts 
Oh  Edward! How can you —But the time will come I hope—I am sure you will like him 
I do not doubt it 
I think  Edward 
[90] able to give them so much of your time  But  with a smile  you would be materially benefited in one particular at least—you would know where to go when you left them I do assure you 
that I have long thought on this point  as you think now  It has been  and is  and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me  that I have had no necessary business to engage me  no profession to give me employment  or afford me any thing like independence  But unfortunately my own nicety  and the nicety of my friends  have made me what I am  an idle  helpless being  We never could agree in our choice of a profession  I always preferred the church  as I still do  But that was not smart enough for my family  They recommended the army  That was a great deal too smart for me  The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men  who had chambers in the Temple  made a very good appearance in the first circles  and drove about town in very knowing gigs  But I had no inclination for the law  even in this less abstruse study of it  which my family approved  As for the navy  it had fashion on its side  but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it; and  at length  as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all  as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one  idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable  and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing  I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since 
The consequence of which  I suppose  will be 
since leisure has not promoted your own happiness  that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits  employments  professions  and trades as Columella s 
They will be brought up 
to be as unlike myself as is possible  In feeling  in action  in condition  in every thing 
[91] more fascinating name  call it hope  Your mother will secure to you  in time  that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty  and it will  it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent  How much may not a few months do I think 
that I may defy many months to produce any good to me 
Well 
we have brought you some strangers  How do you like them 
Hush! they will hear you 
Never mind if they do  It is only the Palmers  Charlotte is very pretty  I can tell you  You may see her if you look this way 
Where is Marianne  Has she run away because we are come  I see her instrument is open 
She is walking  I believe 
[93] of a little company to sit with you  I have brought my other son and daughter to see you  Only think of their coming so suddenly! I thought I heard a carriage last night  while we were drinking our tea  but it never entered my head that it could be them  I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John  I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again—Well! what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so charming! Only think  Mamma  how it is improved since I was here last! I always thought it such a sweet place  ma am!  turning to Mrs  Dashwood  but you have made it so charming! Only look  sister  how delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself! Should not you  Mr  Palmer 
Mr  Palmer does not hear me 
he never does sometimes  It is so ridiculous!
You may believe how glad we all were to see them 
but  however  I can t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast  nor made such a long journey of it  for they came all round by London upon account of some business  for you know  nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter  it was wrong in her situation  I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning  but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all!
She expects to be confined in February 
No  none at all 
Here comes Marianne 
Now  Palmer  you shall see a monstrous pretty girl 
I declare they are quite charming 
I declare they are quite charming 
Oh! dear  how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look  mama  how sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at them for ever 
My love  have you been asleep 
Why should they ask us 
The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very hard terms  if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them  or with us 
They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now 
by these frequent invitations  than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago  The alteration is not in them  if their parties are grown tedious and dull  We must look for the change elsewhere 
I am so glad to see you!
for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come  which would be a shocking thing  as we go away again tomorrow  We must go  for the Westons come to us next week you know  It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all  and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door  and then Mr  Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton  He is so droll! He never tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again in town very soon  I hope 
Not go to town!
I shall be quite disappointed if you do not  I could get the nicest house in world for you  next door to ours  in Hanover-square  You must come  indeed  I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined  if Mrs  Dashwood should not like to go into public 
Oh  my love 
you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter 
How horrid all this is!
Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting  Dullness is as much produced within doors as without  by rain  It makes one detest all one s acquaintance  What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house  How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the weather 
I am afraid  Miss Marianne 
you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today 
Oh  don t be so sly before us 
for we know all about it  I assure you; and I admire your taste very much  for I think he is extremely handsome  We do not live a great way from him in the country  you know  Not above ten miles  I dare say 
Much nearer thirty 
Ah  well! there is not much difference  I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet pretty place 
As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life 
Is it very ugly 
then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose 
My dear 
it is very provoking that we should be so few  Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today 
Did not I tell you  Sir John  when you spoke to me about it before  that it could not be done  They dined with us last 
You and I  Sir John 
should not stand upon such ceremony 
Then you would be very ill-bred 
My love you contradict every body 
Do you know that you are quite rude 
I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred 
Ay  you may abuse me as you please 
you have taken Charlotte off my hands  and cannot give her back again  So there I have the whip hand of you 
Mr  Palmer is so droll!
He is always out of humour 
Oh  my dear Miss Dashwood 
I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister  Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas  Now  pray do —and come while the Westons are with us  You cannot think how happy I shall be! It will be quite delightful!—My love 
don t you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland 
Certainly 
I came into Devonshire with no other view 
There now 
you see Mr  Palmer expects you; so you cannot refuse to come 
But indeed you must and shall come  I am sure you will like it of all things  The Westons will be with us  and it will be quite delightful  You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now  for Mr  Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before  it is quite charming! But  poor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make every body like him 
How charming it will be 
when he is in Parliament!—won t it  How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M P  But do you know  he says  he will never frank for me  He declares he won t  Don t you  Mr  Palmer 
He cannot bear writing  you know 
he says it is quite shocking 
No 
I never said any thing so irrational  Don t palm all your abuses of languages upon me 
There now; you see how droll he is  This is always the way with him! Sometimes he won t speak to me for half a day together  and then he comes out with something so droll—all about any thing in the world 
Certainly 
he seems very agreeable 
Well—I am so glad you do  I thought you would  he is so pleasant; and Mr  Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you  and you can t think how disappointed he will be if you don t come to Cleveland  I can t imagine why you should object to it 
Oh dear  yes; I know him extremely well 
[101] unluckily that we should never have been in the country together  He is very little at Combe  I believe; but if he were ever so much there  I do not think Mr  Palmer would visit him  for he is in the opposition  you know  and besides it is such a way off  I know why you inquire about him  very well; your sister is to marry him  I am monstrous glad of it  for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know Upon my word 
you know much more of the matter than I do  if you have any reason to expect such a match 
Don t pretend to deny it  because you know it is what every body talks of  I assure you I heard of it in my way through town 
My dear Mrs  Palmer!
Upon my honour I did  I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond-street  just before we left town  and he told me of it directly 
You surprise me very much  Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you must be mistaken  To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it  even if it were true  is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do 
But I do assure you it was so  for all that  and I will tell you how it happened  When we met him  he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking of my brother and sister  and one thing and another  and I said to him   So  Colonel  there is a new family come to Barton cottage  I hear  and mama sends me word they are very pretty  and that one of them is going to be married to Mr  Willoughby of Combe Magna  Is it true  pray  for of course you must know  as you have been in Devonshire so lately  
And what did the Colonel say 
Oh—he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true  so from that moment I set it down as certain  It will be quite delightful  I declare! When is it to take place 
Mr  Brandon was very well I hope 
Oh! yes  quite well; and so full of your praises  he did nothing but say fine things of you 
I am flattered by his commendation  He seems an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing 
So do I  He is such a charming man  that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull  Mamma says he was in love with your sister too  I assure you it was a great compliment if he was  for he hardly ever falls in love with any body 
Is Mr  Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire 
Oh! yes  extremely well; that is  I do not believe many people are acquainted with him  because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you  Nobody is more liked than Mr  Willoughby wherever he goes  and so you may tell your sister  She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him  upon my honour; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her  because she is so very handsome and agreeable  that nothing can be good enough for her  However  I don t think her hardly at all handsomer than you  I assure you; for I think you both excessively pretty  and so does Mr  Palmer too I am sure  though we could not get him to own it last night 
I am so glad we are got acquainted at last 
And now I hope we shall always be great friends  You can t think how much I longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage! Nothing can be like it  to be sure! And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna  It is a sweet place  by all accounts 
You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon  have not you 
Yes  a great while; ever since my sister married  He was a particular friend of Sir John s  I believe 
he would have been very glad to have had me  if he could  Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much  But mama did not think the match good enough for me  otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel  and we should have been married immediately 
Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John s proposal to your mother before it was made  Had he never owned his affection to yourself 
Oh  no; but if mama had not objected to it  I dare say he would have liked it of all things  He had not seen me then above twice  for it was before I left school  However  I am much happier as I am  Mr  Palmer is the kind of man I like 
Do come now 
pray come—you must come—I declare you shall come—You can t think how you will like them  Lucy is monstrous pretty  and so good humoured and agreeable! The children are all hanging about her already  as if she was an old acquaintance  And they both long to see you of all things  for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them it is all very true  and a great deal more  You will be delighted with them I am sure  They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children  How can you be so cross as not to come  Why they are your cousins  you know  after a fashion  You are my cousins  and they are my wife s  so you must be related 
John is in such spirits today!
He is full of monkey tricks 
How playful William is!
And here is my sweet little Annamaria 
And she is always so gentle and quiet—Never was there such a quiet little thing!
Poor little creatures!
It might have been a very sad accident 
Yet I hardly know how 
unless it had been under totally different circumstances  But this is the usual way of heightening alarm  where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality 
What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!
And Sir John too 
what a charming man he is!
And what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine children in my life  I declare I quite doat upon them already  and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children 
I should guess so 
from what I have witnessed this morning 
I have a notion 
you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part  I love to see children full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet 
I confess 
that while I am at Barton Park  I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence 
And how do you like Devonshire  Miss Dashwood  I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex 
Norland is a prodigious beautiful place  is not it 
We have heard Sir John admire it excessively 
I think every one must admire it 
who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do 
And had you a great many smart beaux there  I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world; for my part  I think they are a vast addition always 
But why should you think 
that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex 
[109] an t  I m sure there s a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know  how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton  if they had not so many as they used to have  But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux  and had as lief be without them as with them  For my part  I think they are vastly agreeable  provided they dress smart and behave civil  But I can t bear to see them dirty and nasty  Now there s Mr  Rose at Exeter  a prodigious smart young man  quite a beau  clerk to Mr  Simpson  you know  and yet if you do but meet him of a morning  he is not fit to be seen  I suppose your brother was quite a beau  Miss Dashwood  before he married  as he was so rich Upon my word 
I cannot tell you  for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word  But this I can say  that if he ever was a beau before he married  he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him 
Oh! dear! one never thinks of married men s being beaux—they have something else to do 
Lord! Anne 
you can talk of nothing but beaux;—you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else 
 Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure 
and I hear he is quite a beau  and prodigious handsome  And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon —but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already 
His name is Ferrars 
but pray do not tell it  for it s a great secret 
Ferrars!
[112] Dashwood  a very agreeable young man to be sure; I know him very well How can you say so  Anne 
Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle s  it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well 
And who was this uncle  Where did he live  How came they acquainted 
You will think my question an odd one  I dare say 
but pray  are you personally acquainted with your sister-in-law s mother  Mrs  Ferrars 
Indeed!
I wonder at that  for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes  Then  perhaps  you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is 
No 
I know nothing of her 
I am sure you think me very strange  for enquiring about her in such a way 
but perhaps there may be reasons—I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent 
[114] advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation as I am; but  however  there is no occasion to trouble you  I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs  Ferrars I am sorry I do not 
if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her  But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family  and therefore I am a little surprised  I confess  at so serious an inquiry into her character 
I dare say you are  and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it  But if I dared tell you all  you would not be so much surprised  Mrs  Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present—but the time may come—how soon it will come must depend upon herself—when we may be very intimately connected 
Good heavens!
what do you mean  Are you acquainted with Mr  Robert Ferrars  Can you be 
No 
not to Mr  Robert Ferrars—I never saw him in my life; but 
to his eldest brother 
You may well be surprised 
for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always meant to be a great secret  and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour  Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne  and I never should have mentioned it to you  if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs  Ferrars must seem so odd  that it ought to be explained  And I do not think Mr  Ferrars can be displeased  when he knows I have trusted you  because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family  and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters 
May I ask if your engagement is of long standing 
We have been engaged these four years 
Four years!
Yes 
I did not know 
that you were even acquainted till the other day 
Our acquaintance  however  is of many years date  He was under my uncle s care  you know  a considerable while 
Your uncle!
Yes; Mr  Pratt  Did you never hear him talk of Mr  Pratt 
I think I have 
He was four years with my uncle  who lives at Longstaple  near Plymouth  It was there our acquaintance begun  for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle  and it was there our engagement was formed  though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost always with us afterwards  I was very unwilling to enter into it  as you may imagine  without the knowledge and approbation of his mother; but I was too young  and loved him too well  to be so prudent as I ought to have been  Though you do not know him so well as me  Miss Dashwood  you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him 
Certainly 
Engaged to Mr  Edward Ferrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me  that really—I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name  We cannot mean the same Mr  Ferrars 
We can mean no other 
Mr  Edward Ferrars  the eldest son of Mrs  Ferrars  of Park Street  and brother of your sister-in-law  Mrs  John Dashwood  is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends 
It is strange 
that I should never have heard him even mention your name 
No; considering our situation  it was not strange  Our first care has been to keep the matter secret  You knew nothing of me  or my family  and  therefore  there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name to you; and  as he was always particularly afraid of his sister s suspecting any thing  that was reason enough for his not mentioning it 
Four years you have been engaged 
Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait  Poor Edward! It puts him quite out of heart 
To prevent the possibility of mistake  be so good as to look at this face  It does not do him justice  to be sure  but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for  I have had it above these three years 
I have never been able 
to give him my picture in return  which I am very much vexed at  for he has been always so anxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity 
You are quite in the right 
I am sure 
[118] for she would never approve of it  I dare say  I shall have no fortune  and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman I certainly did not seek your confidence 
but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on  Your secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication  You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety 
I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you 
in telling you all this  I have not known you long to be sure  personally at least  but I have known you and all your family by description a great while; and as soon as I saw you  I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance  Besides in the present case  I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward s mother; and I am so unfortunate  that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask  Anne is the only person that knows of it  and she has no judgment at all; indeed  she does me a great deal more harm than good  for I am in constant fear of her betraying me  She does not know how to hold her tongue  as you must perceive  and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t other day  when Edward s name was mentioned by Sir John  lest she should out with it all  You can t think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether  I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward s sake these last four years  Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom—we can hardly meet above twice a-year  I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke 
Sometimes 
I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely 
[119] would do  And on my own account too—so dear as he is to me—I don t think I could be equal to it  What would you advise me to do in such a case  Miss Dashwood  What would you do yourself Pardon me 
but I can give you no advice under such circumstances  Your own judgment must direct you 
To be sure 
his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at Barton  He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple  to go to you  that I was afraid you would think him quite ill 
Did he come from your uncle s  then  when he visited us 
Oh  yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us  Did you think he came directly from town 
No 
I remember he told us  that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth 
Did not you think him sadly out of spirits 
We did  indeed  particularly so when he first arrived 
I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter; but it made him so melancholy  not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us  and seeing me so much affected  Poor fellow!—I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched spirits  I heard from him just before I left Exeter;
You know his hand  I dare say  a charming one it is; but that is not written so well as usual  He was tired  I dare say  for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible 
Writing to each other 
is the only comfort we have in such long separations  Yes  I have one other comfort in his picture  but poor Edward has not even that  If he had but my picture  he says he should be easy  I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last  and that was some comfort to him  he said  but not equal to a picture  Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him 
I did 
I am glad 
you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria s basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight  And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow  and then I hope she will not much mind it 
Indeed you are very much mistaken  Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me  or I should have been at my filigree already  I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now  I am resolved to finish the basket after supper 
You are very good  I hope it won t hurt your eyes:—will you ring the bell for some working candles  My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed  I know  if the basket was not finished tomorrow  for though I told her it certainly would not  I am sure she depends upon having it done 
Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse me—you know I detest cards  I shall go to the piano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned 
Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know  ma am 
and I do not much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard 
Perhaps 
if I should happen to cut out  I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele  in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still to be done to the basket  that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly  to finish it this evening  I should like the work exceedingly  if she would allow me a share in it 
Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help 
for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all 
Oh! that would be terrible  indeed 
Dear little soul  how I do love her!
You are very kind 
and as you really like the work  perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber  or will you take your chance now 
I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with  if I felt no desire for its continuance  or no farther curiosity on its subject  I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again 
Thank you 
for breaking the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday 
Offended me! How could you suppose so  Believe me 
nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea  Could you have a motive for the trust  that was not honourable and flattering to me 
And yet I do assure you 
[127] been quarrelling with myself ever since  for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs  But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy  and that you really do not blame me  If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life  your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure Indeed  I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you  to acknowledge your situation to me  and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it  Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties  and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them  Mr  Ferrars  I believe  is entirely dependent on his mother 
He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to marry upon that  though for my own part  I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh  I have been always used to a very small income  and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him  perhaps  of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her  We must wait  it may be for many years  With almost every other man in the world  it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward s affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know 
That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your s  If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed  as between many people  and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years  engagement  your situation would have been pitiable  indeed 
Edward s love for me 
has been pretty well put to the test  by our long  very long absence since we were first engaged  and it has stood the trial so well  that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now  I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment s alarm on that account from the first 
I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature  and from our different situations in life  from his being so much more in the world than me  and our continual separation  I was enough inclined for suspicion  to have found out the truth in an instant  if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met  or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for  or if he had talked more of one lady than another  or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be  I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick-sighted in general  but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived 
All this 
is very pretty; but it can impose upon neither of us 
But what 
are your views  or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs  Ferrars s death  which is a melancholy and shocking extremity —Is her son determined to submit to this  and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you  rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth 
If we could be certain that it would be only for a while! But Mrs  Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman  and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it  would very likely secure every thing to Robert  and the idea of that  for Edward s sake  frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures 
And for your own sake too  or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason 
Do you know Mr  Robert Ferrars 
Not at all—I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother—silly and a great coxcomb 
A great coxcomb!
Oh  they are talking of their favourite beaux  I dare say 
No sister 
you are mistaken there  our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs 
I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood s is not 
for he is one of the modestest  prettiest behaved young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy  she is such a sly little creature  there is no finding out who she likes 
I can answer for it 
I can answer for it 
Oh 
I dare say Lucy s beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood s 
I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head  for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret  for you are a party concerned  I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can  and then through your interest  which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him  and I hope out of some regard to me  your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living; which I understand is a very good one  and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while  That would be enough for us to marry upon  and we might trust to time and chance for the rest 
I should always be happy 
to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr  Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary  He is brother to Mrs  John Dashwood—that must be recommendation enough to her husband 
But Mrs  John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward s going into orders 
Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little 
I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement  We seem so beset with difficulties on every side  that though it would make us miserable for a time  we should be happier perhaps in the end  But you will not give me your advice  Miss Dashwood 
No 
on such a subject I certainly will not  You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you  unless it were on the side of your wishes 
Indeed you wrong me 
I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe  that if you was to say to me   I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars  it will be more for the happiness of both of you   I should resolve upon doing it immediately 
This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one  It raises my influence much too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person 
 Tis because you are an indifferent person 
that your judgment might justly have such weight with me  If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings  your opinion would not be worth having 
Shall you be in town this winter  Miss Dashwood 
Certainly not 
I am sorry for that 
it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there! But I dare say you will go for all that  To be sure  your brother and sister will ask you to come to them 
It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do 
How unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there  Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward  He will be there in February  otherwise London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it 
Oh  Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well  and I do beg you will favour me with your company  for I ve quite set my heart upon it  Don t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me  for I shan t put myself at all out of my way for you  It will only be sending Betty by the coach  and I hope I can afford that  We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town  if you do not like to go wherever I do  well and good  you may always go with one of my daughters  I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you  it shall not be my fault  I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men  you may depend upon it 
I have a notion 
that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme  if her elder sister would come into it  It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure  because Miss Dashwood does not wish it  So I would advise you two  to set off for town  when you are tired of Barton  without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it 
Nay 
[134] bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself  I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me  Come  Miss Marianne  let us strike hands upon the bargain  and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye  why so much the better I thank you  ma am  sincerely thank you 
your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever  and it would give me such happiness  yes  almost the greatest happiness I am capable of  to be able to accept it  But my mother  my dearest  kindest mother —I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged  and if she were to be made less happy  less comfortable by our absence—Oh! no  nothing should tempt me to leave her  It should not  must not be a struggle 
I am delighted with the plan 
it is exactly what I could wish  Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves  When you and the Middletons are gone  we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too  which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one  It is very right that you should go to town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London  You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman  of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt  And in all probability you will see your brother  and whatever may be his faults  or the faults of his wife  when I consider whose son he is  I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other 
Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness 
you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you  there is still one objection which  in my opinion  cannot be so easily removed 
And what 
is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest  What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward  Do let me hear a word about the expense of it 
My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs  Jennings s heart  she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure  or whose protection will give us consequence 
That is very true 
but of her society  separately from that of other people  you will scarcely have any thing at all  and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton 
If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs  Jennings 
at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation  I have no such scruples  and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort 
I will have you both go 
these objections are nonsensical  You will have much pleasure in being in London  and especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment  she would foresee it there from a variety of sources; she would  perhaps  expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law s family 
I like Edward Ferrars very much  and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest of the family  it is a matter of perfect indifference to me  whether I am ever known to them or not 
I am writing home  Marianne 
had not you better defer your letter for a day or two 
I am not going to write to my mother 
Oh  Elinor  it is Willoughby  indeed it is!
Is your sister ill 
Yes 
almost ever since; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days  but it has never been in my power to return to Barton 
Oh! Colonel 
I am monstrous glad to see you—sorry I could not come before—beg your pardon  but I have been forced to look about me a little  and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been at home  and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with  Lord  I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner! But pray  Colonel  how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today 
I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr  Palmer s  where I have been dining 
Oh  you did; well  and how do they all do at their house  How does Charlotte do  I warrant you she is a fine size by this time 
Mrs  Palmer appeared quite well  and I am commissioned to tell you  that you will certainly see her to-morrow 
Ay  to be sure  I thought as much  Well  Colonel  I have brought two young ladies with me  you see—that is  you see but one of them now  but there is another somewhere  Your friend  Miss Marianne  too—which you will not be sorry to hear  I do not know what you and Mr  Willoughby will do between you about her  Ay  it is a fine thing to be young and handsome  Well! I was young once  but I never was very handsome—worse luck for me  However  I got a very good husband  and I don t know what the greatest beauty can do more  Ah! poor man! he has been dead these eight years and better  But Colonel  where have you been to since we parted  And how does your business go on  Come  come  let s have no secrets among friends 
Mr  Palmer will be so happy to see you 
What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mamma  I forget what it was now  but it was something so droll!
Has no letter been left here for me since we went out 
Are you quite sure of it 
Are you certain that no servant  no porter has left any letter or note 
How very odd!
How odd  indeed!
If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him  as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna; and if he is in town  how odd that he should neither come nor write! Oh! my dear mother  you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young  a man so little known  to be carried on in so doubtful  so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire; and how will my interference be borne 
If this open weather holds much longer 
Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week;  tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day s pleasure  Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem to take it so much to heart 
That is true 
I had not thought of that  This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country 
It is charming weather for them indeed 
How much they must enjoy it! But
it cannot be expected to last long  At this time of the year  and after such a series of rain  we shall certainly have very little more of it  Frosts will soon set in  and in all probability with severity  In another day or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer—nay  perhaps it may freeze tonight!
At any rate 
I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week 
Ay  my dear  I ll warrant you we do  Mary always has her own way 
And now 
she will write to Combe by this day s post 
Don t you find it colder than it was in the morning  Elinor  There seems to me a very decided difference  I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff  It was not so yesterday  I think  The clouds seem parting too  the sun will be out in a moment  and we shall have a clear afternoon 
Good God!
he has been here while we were out 
Depend upon it  he will call again tomorrow 
For me!
No  ma am  for my mistress 
It is indeed for Mrs  Jennings; how provoking!
You are expecting a letter  then 
Yes  a little—not much 
You have no confidence in me  Marianne 
Nay  Elinor  this reproach from you—you who have confidence in no one!
Me!
indeed  Marianne  I have nothing to tell 
Nor I 
our situations then are alike  We have neither of us any thing to tell; you  because you do not communicate  and I  because I conceal nothing 
I thought you were both in Devonshire 
Did you 
When do you go back again 
I do not know 
Aye  aye 
we know the reason of all that very well; if a certain person who shall be nameless  had been there  you would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited 
Invited!
So my daughter Middleton told me  for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning 
your sister looks unwell to-day 
[149] sister seems out of spirits your sister s engagement to Mr  Willoughby is very generally known 
It cannot be generally known 
for her own family do not know it 
I beg your pardon  I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended  as they openly correspond  and their marriage is universally talked of 
How can that be  By whom can you have heard it mentioned 
By many—by some of whom you know nothing  by others with whom you are most intimate  Mrs  Jennings  Mrs  Palmer  and the Middletons  But still I might not have believed it  for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced  it will always find something to support its doubts  if I had not  when the servant let me in today  accidentally seen a letter in his hand  directed to Mr  Willoughby in your sister s writing  I came to inquire  but I was convinced before I could ask the question  Is every thing finally settled  Is it impossible to-  But I have no right  and I could have no chance of succeeding  Excuse me  Miss Dashwood  I believe I have been wrong in saying so much  but I hardly know what to do  and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence  Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on  that any attempt  that in short concealment  if concealment be possible  is all that remains 
to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her 
Good heavens!
he is there—he is there—Oh! why does he not look at me  why cannot I speak to him 
Pray  pray be composed 
and do not betray what you feel to every body present  Perhaps he has not observed you yet 
Good God! Willoughby  what is the meaning of this  Have you not received my letters  Will you not shake hands with me 
I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday  and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs  Jennings at home  My card was not lost  I hope 
But have you not received my notes 
Here is some mistake I am sure—some dreadful mistake  What can be the meaning of it  Tell me  Willoughby; for heaven s sake tell me  what is the matter 
Yes  I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town  which you were so good as to send me 
Go to him  Elinor 
and force him to come to me  Tell him I must see him again—must speak to him instantly  I cannot rest—I shall not have a moment s peace till this is explained—some dreadful misapprehension or other  Oh  go to him this moment 
How can that be done  No  my dearest Marianne  you must wait  This is not the place for explanations  Wait only till tomorrow 
Marianne  may I ask—
No  Elinor 
ask nothing; you will soon know all 
Upon my word  I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life! My girls were nothing to her  and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as for Miss Marianne  she is quite an altered creature  I hope  from the bottom of my heart  he won t keep her waiting much longer  for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn  Pray  when are they to be married 
And have you really  Ma am  talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to Mr  Willoughby  I thought it had been only a joke  but so serious a question seems to imply more; and I must beg  therefore  that you will not deceive yourself any longer  I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married 
For shame  for shame  Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so  Don t we all know that it must be a match  that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met  Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day  and all day long; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes  Come  come  this won t do  Because you are so sly about it yourself  you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such thing  I can tell you  for it has been known all over town this ever so long  I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte 
Indeed  Ma am 
you are mistaken  Indeed  you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report  and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now 
  I am  dear Madam   Your most obedient humble servant    With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood  may be imagined  Though aware  before she began it  that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy  and confirm their separation for ever  she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling—so far from the common decorum of a gentleman  as to send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which  instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret  acknowledged no breach of faith  denied all peculiar affection whatever;—a letter of which every line was an insult  and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy   She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then read it again and again; but every perusal only [159] served to increase her abhorrence of the man  and so bitter were her feelings against him  that she dared not trust herself to speak  lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement  not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils  a connection  for life  with an unprincipled man  as a deliverance the most real  a blessing the most important   In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter  on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it  and probably  on the very different mind of a very different person  who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed  Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister  forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread  and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room  that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door  she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early  she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs  Jennings s chariot  which she knew had not been ordered till one  Determined not to quit Marianne  though hopeless of contributing  at present  to her ease  she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs  Jennings  on account of her sister being indisposed  Mrs  Jennings  with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause  admitted the excuse most readily  and Elinor  after seeing her safe off  returned to Marianne  whom she found attempting to rise from the bed  and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor  faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite  and many nights since she had really slept; and now  when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense  the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head  a weakened stomach  and a general nervous faintness  A glass of wine  which Elinor procured for her directly  made her more comfortable  and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness  by saying    replied her sister  
 This  as every thing else would have been  was too much for Marianne  who could only exclaim  in the anguish of her [160] heart   Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence    she cried  
  cried Marianne; 
   throwing her arms round her sister s neck; 
   cried Marianne wildly  
     cried Marianne  
  [161]      Elinor said no more  and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before  directly ran over the contents of all  The first  which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town  was to this effect:—   M D  M D  M D I felt myself 
to be as solemnly engaged to him  as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other 
I can believe it 
but unfortunately he did not feel the same 
[163] felt it  I know he did  Whatever may have changed him now   and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it   I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish  This lock of hair  which now he can so readily give up  was begged of me with the most earnest supplication  Had you seen his look  his manner  had you heard his voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton  The morning that we parted too! When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again—his distress—can I ever forget his distress Elinor  I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby 
Dearest Marianne  who but himself  By whom can he have been instigated 
By all the world  rather than by his own heart  I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion  than believe his nature capable of such cruelty  This woman of whom he writes—whoever she be—or any one  in short  but your own dear self  mama  and Edward  may have been so barbarous to bely me  Beyond you three  is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby  whose heart I know so well 
Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy  let them be cheated of their malignant triumph  my dear sister  by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits  It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence 
No  no 
misery such as mine has no pride  I care not who knows that I am wretched  The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world  Elinor  Elinor  they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like—may resist insult  or return mortification—but I cannot  I must feel—I must be wretched—and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can 
But for my mother s sake and mine—
I would do more than for my own  But to appear happy when I am so miserable—Oh! who can require it 
It is too much! Oh  Willoughby  Willoughby  could this be yours! Cruel  cruel—nothing can acquit you  Elinor  nothing can  Whatever he might have heard against me  ought he not to have suspended his belief  ought he not to have told me of it  to have given me the power of clearing myself   The lock of hair   repeating it from the letter   which you so obligingly bestowed on me —That is unpardonable  Willoughby  where was your heart when you wrote those words  Oh  barbarously insolent!—Elinor  can he be justified 
No  Marianne  in no possible way 
And yet this woman—who knows what her art may have been —how long it may have been premeditated  and how deeply contrived by her!—Who is she —Who can she be —Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance —Oh! no one  no one—he talked to me only of myself 
Elinor  I must go home  I must go and comfort mama  Can not we be gone to-morrow 
To-morrow  Marianne!
Yes  why should I stay here  I came only for Willoughby s sake—and now who cares for me  Who regards me 
It would be impossible to go to-morrow  We owe Mrs  Jennings much more than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that 
Well then  another day or two  perhaps; but I cannot stay here long  I cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people  The Middletons and Palmers—how am I to bear their pity  The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh  what would he say to that!
How do you do my dear 
How is she  Miss Dashwood —Poor thing! she looks very bad  No wonder  Ay  it is but too true  He is to be married very soon—a good-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him  Mrs  Taylor told me of it half an hour ago  and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself  else I am sure I should not have believed it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was  Well  said I  all I can say is  that if this be true  he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill  and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out  And so I shall always say  my dear  you may depend on it  I have no notion of men s going on in this way; and if ever I meet him again  I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day  But there is one comfort  my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers  Well  poor thing! I won t disturb her any longer  for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with  The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know  and that will amuse her 
no  she would go down; she could bear it very well  and the bustle about her would be less 
Poor soul!
[167] should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there is plenty of money on one side  and next to none on the other  Lord bless you! they care no more about such things!The lady then—Miss Grey I think you called her —is very rich 
Fifty thousand pounds  my dear  Did you ever see her  a smart  stylish girl they say  but not handsome  I remember her aunt very well  Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man  But the family are all rich together  Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts  it won t come before it s wanted; for they say he is all to pieces  No wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well  it don t signify talking; but when a young man  be who he will  comes and makes love to a pretty girl  and promises marriage  he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor  and a richer girl is ready to have him  Why don t he  in such a case  sell his horses  let his house  turn off his servants  and make a thorough reform at once  I warrant you  Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round  But that won t do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age 
Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is  Is she said to be amiable 
I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned; except that Mrs  Taylor did say this morning  that one day Miss Walker hinted to her  that she believed Mr  and Mrs  Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married  for she and Mrs  Ellison could never agree 
And who are the Ellisons 
Her guardians  my dear  But now she is of age and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has made!—What now 
your poor sister is gone to her own room  I suppose  to moan by herself  Is there nothing one can get to comfort her  Poor dear  it seems quite cruel to let her be alone  Well  by-and-by we shall have a few friends  and that will amuse her a little  What shall we play at  She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for 
[168] shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed  for I am sure she wants rest Aye  I believe that will be best for her  Let her name her own supper  and go to bed  Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two  for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that  And so the letter that came today finished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it  I would not have joked her about it for all my money  But then you know  how should I guess such a thing  I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter  and you know young people like to be laughed at about them  Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home  and told them of it  But I shall see them tomorrow 
It would be unnecessary I am sure  for you to caution Mrs  Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr  Willoughby  or making the slightest allusion to what has passed  before my sister  Their own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject  the more my feelings will be spared  as you my dear madam will easily believe 
Oh! Lord! yes  that I do indeed  It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister  I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world  You saw I did not all dinner time  No more would Sir John  nor my daughters  for they are all very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint  as I certainly will  For my part  I think the less that is said about such things  the better  the sooner  tis blown over and forgot  And what does talking ever do you know 
In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind  for it has been attended by circumstances which  for the sake of every one concerned in it  make it unfit to become the public conversation  I must do this justice to Mr  Willoughby—he has broken no positive engagement with my sister 
[169] House  and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter!Well  my dear   tis a true saying about an ill-wind  for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon  He will have her at last; aye  that he will  Mind me  now  if they an t married by Mid-summer  Lord! how he ll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight  It will be all to one a better match for your sister  Two thousand a year without debt or drawback—except the little love-child  indeed; aye  I had forgot her; but she may be  prenticed out at a small cost  and then what does it signify  Delaford is a nice place  I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place  full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there! Then  there is a dovecote  some delightful stew-ponds  and a very pretty canal; and every thing  in short  that one could wish for; and  moreover  it is close to the church  and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road  so  tis never dull  for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house  you may see all the carriages that pass along  Oh!  tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in the village  and the parsonage-house within a stone s throw  To my fancy  a thousand times prettier than Barton Park  where they are forced to send three miles for their meat  and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother  Well  I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can  One shoulder of mutton  you know  drives another down  If we can but put Willoughby out of her head!
Ay  if we can do that  Ma am 
we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon 
You had better leave me 
I will leave you 
if you will go to bed 
My dear 
I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted  so I have brought a glass of it for your sister  My poor husband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout  he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world  Do take it to your sister 
Dear Ma am 
how good you are! But I have just left Marianne in bed  and  I hope  almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest  if you will give me leave  I will drink the wine myself 
The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see  He knows nothing of it; do tell him  my dear 
How fond he was of it!
How fond he was of it!
Marianne is not well 
She has been indisposed all day  and we have persuaded her to go to bed 
Perhaps  then 
what I heard this morning may be—there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first 
What did you hear 
That a gentleman  whom I had reason to think—in short  that a man  whom I knew to be engaged—but how shall I tell you  If you know it already  as surely you must  I may be spared 
You mean 
Mr  Willoughby s marriage with Miss Grey  Yes  we do know it all  This seems to have been a day of general elucidation  for this very morning first unfolded it to us  Mr  Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear it 
In a stationer s shop in Pall Mall  where I had business  Two ladies were waiting for their carriage  and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match  in a voice so little attempting concealment  that it was impossible for me not to hear all  The name of Willoughby  John Willoughby  frequently repeated  first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey—it was no longer to be a secret—it would take place even within a few weeks  with many particulars of preparations and other matters  One thing  especially  I remember  because it served to identify the man still more:—as soon as the ceremony was over  they were to go to Combe Magna  his seat in Somersetshire  My astonishment!—but it would be impossible to describe what I felt  The communicative lady I learnt  on inquiry  for I stayed in the shop till they were gone  was a Mrs  Ellison  and that  as I have been since informed  is the name of Miss Grey s guardian 
It is  But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds  In that  if in any thing  we may find an explanation 
It may be so; but Willoughby is capable—at least I think—
And your sister  how did she —
Her sufferings have been very severe  I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short  It has been  it is a most cruel affliction  Till yesterday  I believe  she never doubted his regard; and even now  perhaps—but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her  He has been very deceitful! and  in some points  there seems a hardness of heart about him 
Ah!
there is  indeed! But your sister does not—I think you said so—she does not consider quite as you do 
You know her disposition  and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could 
No  no  no  it cannot be 
she cannot feel  Her kindness is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness  All that she wants is gossip  and she only likes me now because I supply it 
Now  my dear  I bring you something that I am sure will do you good 
Who can this be 
So early too! I thought we had been safe 
It is Colonel Brandon!
We are never safe from him 
He will not come in  as Mrs  Jennings is from home 
I will not trust to that 
A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others 
I met Mrs  Jennings in Bond Street 
and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged  because I thought it probable that I might find you alone  which I was very desirous of doing  My object—my wish—my sole wish in desiring it—I hope  I believe it is—is to be a means of giving comfort;—no  I must not say comfort—not present comfort—but conviction  lasting conviction to your sister s mind  My regard for her  for yourself  for your mother—will you allow me to prove it  by relating some circumstances which nothing but a very sincere regard—nothing but an earnest desire of being useful—I think I am justified—though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right  is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong 
I understand you 
You have something to tell me of Mr  Willoughby  that will open his character farther  Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne  My gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end  and hers must be gained by it in time  Pray  pray let me hear it 
You shall; and  to be brief  when I quitted Barton last October —but this will give you no idea—I must go farther back  You will find me a very awkward narrator  Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin  A short account of myself  I believe  will be necessary  and it shall be a short one  On such a subject 
can I have little temptation to be diffuse 
You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation— it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you —a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park—it was the evening of a dance—in which I alluded to a lady I had once known  as resembling  in some measure  your sister Marianne 
Indeed 
I have not forgotten it 
[178] then was  a few months must have reconciled me to it  or at least I should not have now to lament it  This however was not the case  My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been  and from the first he treated her unkindly  The consequence of this  upon a mind so young  so lively  so inexperienced as Mrs  Brandon s  was but too natural  She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned  But can we wonder that  with such a husband to provoke inconstancy  and without a friend to advise or restrain her  for my father lived only a few months after their marriage  and I was with my regiment in the East Indies  she should fall  Had I remained in England  perhaps—but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years  and for that purpose had procured my exchange  The shock which her marriage had given me was of trifling weight—was nothing to what I felt when I heard  about two years afterwards  of her divorce  It was that which threw this gloom —even now the recollection of what I suffered—
[179] of my own  who had since fallen into misfortune  carried me to visit him in a spunging-house  where he was confined for debt; and there  in the same house  under a similar confinement  was my unfortunate sister  So altered—so faded—worn down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me  to be the remains of the lovely  blooming  healthful girl  on whom I had once doted  What I endured in so beholding her—but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it—I have pained you too much already  That she was  to all appearance  in the last stage of a consumption  was—yes  in such a situation it was my greatest comfort  Life could do nothing for her  beyond giving time for a better preparation for death; and that was given  I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings  and under proper attendants; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her last moments Your sister  I hope  cannot be offended 
[180] am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her  It is now three years ago  she had just reached her fourteenth year   that I removed her from school  to place her under the care of a very respectable woman  residing in Dorsetshire  who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation  But last February  almost a twelvemonth back  she suddenly disappeared  I had allowed her   imprudently  as it has since turned out   at her earnest desire  to go to Bath with one of her young friends  who was attending her father there for his health  I knew him to be a very good sort of man  and I thought well of his daughter—better than she deserved  for  with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy  she would tell nothing  would give no clue  though she certainly knew all  He  her father  a well-meaning  but not a quick-sighted man  could really  I believe  give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house  while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried to convince me  as thoroughly as he was convinced himself  of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business  In short  I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest  for eight long months  was left to conjecture  What I thought  what I feared  may be imagined; and what I suffered too Good heavens!
could it be—could Willoughby!
The first news that reached me of her 
[181] a situation of the utmost distress  with no creditable home  no help  no friends  ignorant of his address! He had left her  promising to return; he neither returned  nor wrote  nor relieved her This is beyond every thing!
His character is now before you; expensive  dissipated  and worse than both  Knowing all this  as I have now known it many weeks  guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever  and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt for all your sakes  When I came to you last week and found you alone  I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it was known  My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now you will comprehend it  To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see your sister—but what could I do  I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him  But now  after such dishonorable usage  who can tell what were his designs on her  Whatever they may have been  however  she may now  and hereafter doubtless will  turn with gratitude towards her own condition  when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza  when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl  and pictures her to herself  with an affection for him so strong  still as strong as her own  and with a mind tormented by self-reproach  which must attend her through life  Surely this comparison must have its use with her  She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing  They proceed from no misconduct  and can bring no disgrace  On the contrary  every friend must be made still more her friend by them  Concern for her unhappiness  and respect for her fortitude under it  must strengthen every attachment  Use your own discretion  however  in communicating to her what I have told you  You must know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously  and from my heart believed it might be of service  might lessen her regrets  I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions  with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others 
I have been more pained 
by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do  Now  though at first she will suffer much  I am sure she will soon become easier  Have you 
ever seen Mr  Willoughby since you left him at Barton 
Yes 
once I have  One meeting was unavoidable 
What  have you met him to—
I could meet him no other way  Eliza had confessed to me  though most reluctantly  the name of her lover; and when he returned to town  which was within a fortnight after myself  we met by appointment  he to defend  I to punish his conduct  We returned unwounded  and the meeting  therefore  never got abroad 
Such 
has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust!
Is she still in town 
No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in  for I found her near her delivery  I removed her and her child into the country  and there she remains 
A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an unaccountable business  He wished him at the devil with all his heart  He would not speak another word to him  meet him where he might  for all the world! No  not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert  and they were kept watching for two hours together  Such a scoundrel of a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly s puppies! and this was the end of it!
She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately  and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all  She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify  for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again  and she should tell everybody she saw  how good-for-nothing he was 
It is very shocking  indeed!
I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here still 
[189] brother and sister came  And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone  I am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word Well  my dear 
and how did you travel 
Not in the stage  I assure you 
we came post all the way  and had a very smart beau to attend us  Dr  Davies was coming to town  and so we thought we d join him in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly  and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did 
Oh  oh!
very pretty  indeed! and the Doctor is a single man  I warrant you 
There now 
everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor  and I cannot think why  My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour s end to another   Lord! here comes your beau  Nancy   my cousin said t other day  when she saw him crossing the street to the house  My beau  indeed! said I—I cannot think who you mean  The Doctor is no beau of mine 
Aye  aye  that is very pretty talking—but it won t do—the Doctor is the man  I see 
No  indeed!
and I beg you will contradict it  if you ever hear it talked of 
I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister  Miss Dashwood  when they come to town 
No  I do not think we shall 
Oh  yes  I dare say you will 
What a charming thing it is that Mrs  Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together!
Long a time  indeed!
Why  their visit is but just begun!
I am sorry we cannot see your sister  Miss Dashwood 
I am sorry she is not well—
You are very good  My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches  which make her unfit for company or conversation 
Oh  dear  that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and me!—I think she might see us; and I am sure we would not speak a word 
Oh  if that s all 
we can just as well go and see her 
I wished very much to call upon you yesterday 
but it was impossible  for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs  Ferrars  Harry was vastly pleased  This morning I had fully intended to call on you  if I could possibly find a spare half hour  but one has always so much to do on first coming to town  I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal  But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street  and be introduced to your friend Mrs  Jennings  I understand she is a woman of very good fortune  And the Middletons too  you must introduce me to them  As my mother-in-law s relations  I shall be happy to show them every respect  They are excellent neighbours to you in the country  I understand 
Excellent indeed  Their attention to our comfort  their friendliness in every particular  is more than I can express 
I am extremely glad to hear it  upon my word; extremely glad indeed  But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune  they are related to you  and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected  And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the most complete thing of its kind  he said  that ever was  and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing  It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it  I assure you 
but she was so much engaged with her mother  that really she had no leisure for going any where 
Who is Colonel Brandon  Is he a man of fortune 
Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire 
I am glad of it  He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think  Elinor  I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life 
Me  brother! what do you mean 
He likes you  I observed him narrowly  and am convinced of it  What is the amount of his fortune 
I believe about two thousand a year 
Two thousand a-year;
Elinor  I wish with all my heart it were twice as much  for your sake 
Indeed I believe you 
  lowering his voice to an important whisper  
 Recollecting himself  however  he added  
 Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer    he continued  
  said Elinor  with resolution  
  He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say—      Elinor could only smile     said Elinor; 
  he gravely replied; 
   Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present  to share the provocation   Having now said enough to make his poverty clear  and to [199] do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters  in his next visit at Gray s his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn  and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs  Jennings          said he  seeming to recollect himself  
   Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished  and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman  and promoting the marriage by every possible attention  He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself  to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon  or a legacy from Mrs  Jennings  was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect   They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home  and Sir John came in before their visit ended  Abundance of civilities passed on all sides  Sir John was ready to like anybody  and though Mr  Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses  he soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr  Dashwood went away delighted with both    said he  as he walked back with his sister  
CHAPTER XXXIV  Mrs  John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband s judgment  that she waited the very next day both on Mrs  Jennings and her daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former  even the woman with whom her sisters were staying  by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton  she found her one of the most charming women in the world!  Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs  Dashwood  There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides  which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor  and a general want of understanding   The same manners  however  which recommended Mrs  John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs  Jennings  and to her she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address  who met her husband s sisters without any affection  and almost without having anything to say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street  she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence   Elinor wanted very much to know  though she did not choose to ask  whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her  till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on  or till her husband s expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other  that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion  The intelligence however  which she would not give  soon flowed from another quarter  Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor s compassion on being unable to see Edward  though he had arrived in town with Mr  and Mrs  [202] Dashwood  He dared not come to Bartlett s Buildings for fear of detection  and though their mutual impatience to meet  was not to be told  they could do nothing at present but write   Edward assured them himself of his being in town  within a very short time  by twice calling in Berkeley Street  Twice was his card found on the table  when they returned from their morning s engagements  Elinor was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had missed him   The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons  that  though not much in the habit of giving anything  they determined to give them—a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began  invited them to dine in Harley Street  where they had taken a very good house for three months  Their sisters and Mrs  Jennings were invited likewise  and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon  who  always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were  received his eager civilities with some surprise  but much more pleasure  They were to meet Mrs  Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party  The expectation of seeing her  however  was enough to make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction  though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself  her desire of being in company with Mrs  Ferrars  her curiosity to know what she was like  was as lively as ever   The interest with which she thus anticipated the party  was soon afterwards increased  more powerfully than pleasantly  by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it   So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton  so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her  that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant  and her sister not even genteel  she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles  as soon as the Dashwoods  invitation was known  that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place   Their claims to the notice of Mrs  John Dashwood  as the [203] nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother  might not have done much  however  towards procuring them seats at her table; but as Lady Middleton s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy  who had long wanted to be personally known to the family  to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties  and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them  had seldom been happier in her life  than she was on receiving Mrs  John Dashwood s card   On Elinor its effect was very different  She began immediately to determine  that Edward who lived with his mother  must be asked as his mother was  to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the first time  after all that passed  in the company of Lucy!—she hardly knew how she could bear it!  These apprehensions  perhaps  were not founded entirely on reason  and certainly not at all on truth  They were relieved however  not by her own recollection  but by the good will of Lucy  who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday  and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself  which he could not conceal when they were together   The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law    said Lucy  as they walked up the stairs together—for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs  Jennings  that they all followed the servant at the same time—
 Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton s mother  rather than her own  whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that  she assured her  and with great sincerity  that she did pity her—to the utter amazement of Lucy  who  though really uncomfortable herself  hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor   Mrs  Ferrars was a little  thin woman  upright  even to [204] formality  in her figure  and serious  even to sourness  in her aspect  Her complexion was sallow; and her features small  without beauty  and naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity  by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature  She was not a woman of many words; for  unlike people in general  she proportioned them to the number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her  not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood  whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events   Elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour  A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs  Ferrars  power to distress her by it now; and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles  a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more  only amused her  She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person—for Lucy was particularly distinguished—whom of all others  had they known as much as she did  they would have been most anxious to mortify; while she herself  who had comparatively no power to wound them  sat pointedly slighted by both  But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied  she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which it sprung  nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance  without thoroughly despising them all four   Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teased about Dr  Davies to be perfectly happy   The dinner was a grand one  the servants were numerous  and every thing bespoke the Mistress s inclination for show  and the Master s ability to support it  In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate  and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss  nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it; no poverty of any kind  except of conversation  appeared; but there  the deficiency was considerable  John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing  and his wife had still less  But there was no peculiar [205] disgrace in this; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors  who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable—Want of sense  either natural or improved—want of elegance—want of spirits—or want of temper   When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner  this poverty was particularly evident  for the gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some variety—the variety of politics  inclosing land  and breaking horses—but then it was all over; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in  which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood  and Lady Middleton s second son William  who were nearly of the same age   Had both the children been there  the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present  it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion  and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked   The parties stood thus:—  The two mothers  though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest  politely decided in favour of the other  The two grandmothers  with not less partiality  but more sincerity  were equally earnest in support of their own descendant   Lucy  who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other  thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age  and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them; and Miss Steele  with yet greater address gave it  as fast as she could  in favour of each   Elinor  having once delivered her opinion on William s side  by which she offended Mrs  Ferrars and Fanny still more  did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne  when called on for her s  offended them all  by declaring that she had no opinion to give  as she had never thought about it   Before her removing from Norland  Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law  which being now just mounted and brought home  ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens  catching the eye of John [206] Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room  were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration    said he; 
 The Colonel  though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship  warmly admired the screens  as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited  they were handed round for general inspection  Mrs  Ferrars  not aware of their being Elinor s work  particularly requested to look at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middleton s approbation  Fanny presented them to her mother  considerately informing her  at the same time  that they were done by Miss Dashwood   —said Mrs  Ferrars—
 Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough —for  colouring a little  she immediately said—   But then again  the dread of having been too civil  too encouraging herself  probably came over her  for she presently added  
  Marianne could not bear this  She was already greatly displeased with Mrs  Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another  at Elinor s expense  though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it  provoked her immediately to say with warmth—   And so saying  she took the screens out of her sister-in-law s hands  to admire them herself as they ought to be admired   [207] Mrs  Ferrars  Mrs  Ferrars   Mrs  Ferrars looked exceedingly angry  and drawing herself [208] up more stiffly than ever  pronounced in retort this bitter philippic   Fanny looked very angry too  and her husband was all in a fright at his sister s audacity  Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne s warmth than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon s eyes  as they were fixed on Marianne  declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it  the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point   Marianne s feelings did not stop here  The cold insolence of Mrs  Ferrars s general behaviour to her sister  seemed  to her  to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor  as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility  she moved after a moment  to her sister s chair  and putting one arm round her neck  and one cheek close to hers  said in a low  but eager  voice—   She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome  and hiding her face on Elinor s shoulder  she burst into tears  Every body s attention was called  and almost every body was concerned  Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did  Mrs  Jennings  with a very intelligent  In a few minutes  however  Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle  and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed  the whole evening    said her brother to Colonel Brandon  in a low voice  as soon as he could secure his attention: 
 [209] CHAPTER XXXV  Elinor s curiosity to see Mrs  Ferrars was satisfied  She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable  She had seen enough of her pride  her meanness  and her determined prejudice against herself  to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement  and retarded the marriage  of Edward and herself  had he been otherwise free;—and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake  that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs  Ferrars s creation  preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice  or any solicitude for her good opinion  Or at least  if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward s being fettered to Lucy  she determined  that had Lucy been more amiable  she ought to have rejoiced   She wondered that Lucy s spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs  Ferrars;—that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was not Elinor appear a compliment to herself—or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her  because her real situation was unknown  But that it was so  had not only been declared by Lucy s eyes at the time  but was declared over again the next morning more openly  for at her particular desire  Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone  to tell her how happy she was   The chance proved a lucky one  for a message from Mrs  Palmer soon after she arrived  carried Mrs  Jennings away    cried Lucy  as soon as they were by themselves  
   Elinor wished to talk of something else  but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go on    said she  
  replied Lucy quickly—
 To this Elinor had no answer to make  and did not attempt any      Elinor tried to make a civil answer  though doubting her own success  But it seemed to satisfy Lucy  for she directly replied—   But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she should tell her sister  Lucy continued    Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph  by the door s being thrown open  the servant s announcing Mr  Ferrars  and Edward s immediately walking in   It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that it was so  They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again  as to advance farther into it  The very circumstance  in its unpleasantest form  which they would each have been most anxious to avoid  had fallen on them  They were not only all three together  but were together without the relief of any other person  The ladies recovered themselves first  It was not Lucy s business to put herself forward  and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up  She could therefore only look her tenderness  and after slightly addressing him  said no more   But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she  for his sake and her own  to do it well  that she forced herself  after a moment s recollection  to welcome him  with a look and manner that were almost easy  and almost open; and another struggle  another effort still improved them  She would not allow the presence of Lucy  nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself  to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him  and that she had very much regretted being from home  when he called before in Berkeley Street  She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which  as a friend and almost a relation  were his due  [212] by the observant eyes of Lucy  though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her   Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward  and he had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion  which the case rendered reasonable  though his sex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy s  nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor s   Lucy  with a demure and settled air  seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others  and would not say a word; and almost every thing that was said  proceeded from Elinor  who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother s health  their coming to town  &c  which Edward ought to have inquired about  but never did   Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine  under pretence of fetching Marianne  to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it  and that in the handsomest manner  for she loitered away several minutes on the landing-place  with the most high-minded fortitude  before she went to her sister  When that was once done  however  it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne s joy hurried her into the drawing-room immediately  Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings  strong in itself  and strongly spoken  She met him with a hand that would be taken  and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister    she cried  
 Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved  but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt  Again they all sat down  and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness  sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor  regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy s unwelcome presence  Edward was the first to speak  and it was to notice Marianne s altered looks  and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her    she replied with spirited earnestness  though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke  
[213]  This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy  nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy  who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression     She paused—no one spoke    she presently added  
 Poor Edward muttered something  but what it was  nobody knew  not even himself  But Marianne  who saw his agitation  and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself  was perfectly satisfied  and soon talked of something else    And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever  and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother  till they were more in private       cried Lucy  eager to take some revenge on her  
 Elinor was very angry  but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied—   The nature of her commendation  in the present case  however  happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors  and was so very unexhilarating to Edward  that he very soon got up to go away    said Marianne; 
 And drawing him a little aside  she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer  But even this encouragement failed  for he would go; and Lucy  who would have outstayed him  had his visit lasted two hours  soon afterwards went away    said Marianne  on her leaving them  
  Marianne looked at her steadily  and said   She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more  for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy  she could give no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be  she was obliged to submit to it  All that she could hope  was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne s mistaken warmth  nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting—and this she had every reason to expect   [215] Drawing him a little aside [216 Drawing him a little aside   [216] CHAPTER XXXVI  Within a few days after this meeting  the newspapers announced to the world  that the lady of Thomas Palmer  Esq  was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph  at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before   This event  highly important to Mrs  Jennings s happiness  produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time  and influenced  in a like degree  the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte  she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed  and did not return till late in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods  at the particular request of the Middletons  spent the whole of every day  in Conduit Street  For their own comfort they would much rather have remained  at least all the morning  in Mrs  Jennings s house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody  Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles  by whom their company  in fact was as little valued  as it was professedly sought   They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye  as intruding on their ground  and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize  Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton s behaviour to Elinor and Marianne  she did not really like them at all  Because they neither flattered herself nor her children  she could not believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading  she fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical; but that did not signify  It was censure in common use  and easily given   Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy  It checked the idleness of one  and the business of the other  Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them  and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times  she feared they would despise her for offering  Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three  [217] by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely  Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr  Willoughby  she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner  which their arrival occasioned  But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor  and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne  no effect was produced  but a look of indifference from the former  or of disgust in the latter  An effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend  Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor! But so little were they  anymore than the others  inclined to oblige her  that if Sir John dined from home  she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject  than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself   All these jealousies and discontents  however  were so totally unsuspected by Mrs  Jennings  that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young friends every night  on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long  She joined them sometimes at Sir John s  sometimes at her own house; but wherever it was  she always came in excellent spirits  full of delight and importance  attributing Charlotte s well doing to her own care  and ready to give so exact  so minute a detail of her situation  as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire  One thing did disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint  Mr  Palmer maintained the common  but unfatherly opinion among his sex  of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive  at different times  the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides  there was no convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world   I come now to the relation of a misfortune  which about this time befell Mrs  John Dashwood  It so happened that while her two sisters with Mrs  Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street  another of her acquaintance had dropt in—a [218] circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her  But while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct  and to decide on it by slight appearances  one s happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance  In the present instance  this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability  that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods  and understanding them to be Mr  Dashwood s sisters  she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards  cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister  to a small musical party at her house  The consequence of which was  that Mrs  John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods  but  what was still worse  must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time  The power of disappointing them  it was true  must always be her s  But that was not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong  they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them   Marianne had now been brought by degrees  so much into the habit of going out every day  that it was become a matter of indifference to her  whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening s engagement  though without expecting the smallest amusement from any  and very often without knowing  till the last moment  where it was to take her   To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent  as not to bestow half the consideration on it  during the whole of her toilet  which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being together  when it was finished  Nothing escaped her minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing  and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne s dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself  and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted  how much her washing cost per week  and how much she had every year [219] to spend upon herself  The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies  moreover  was generally concluded with a compliment  which though meant as its douceur  was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown  the colour of her shoes  and the arrangement of her hair  she was almost sure of being told that upon  With such encouragement as this  was she dismissed on the present occasion  to her brother s carriage; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door  a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law  who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance  and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman   The events of this evening were not very remarkable  The party  like other musical parties  comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance  and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers themselves were  as usual  in their own estimation  and that of their immediate friends  the first private performers in England   As Elinor was neither musical  nor affecting to be so  she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte  whenever it suited her  and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp  and violoncello  would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room  In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men  the very he  who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at Gray s  She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself  and speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just determined to find out his name from the latter  when they both came towards her  and Mr  Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr  Robert Ferrars   He addressed her with easy civility  and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done  that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy  Happy had it been for her  if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit  than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his brother s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour [220] of his mother and sister would have begun  But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men  she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one  put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other  Why they were different  Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour s conversation; for  talking of his brother  and lamenting the extreme gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society  he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency  than to the misfortune of a private education; while he himself  though probably without any particular  any material superiority by nature  merely from the advantage of a public school  was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man    he added  
 Elinor would not oppose his opinion  because  whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school  she could not think of Edward s abode in Mr  Pratt s family  with any satisfaction   —was his next observation  
 Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire  without living near Dawlish  He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house    said he  
Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations  no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake  I was last month at my friend Elliott s  near Dartford  Lady Elliott wished to give a dance   But how can it be done   said she;  my dear Ferrars  do tell me how it is to be managed  There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple  and where can the supper be   I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it  so I said   My dear Lady Elliott  do not be uneasy  The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the saloon   Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought  We measured the dining-room  and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple  and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan  So that  in fact  you see  if people do but know how to set about it  every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling 
I do not see how it can be done 
without affronting Lady Middleton  for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it  You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power  as my taking them out this evening shows  But they are Lady Middleton s visitors  How can I ask them away from her 
They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street  and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations 
My love I would ask them with all my heart  if it was in my power  But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us  They are very well behaved  good kind of girls; and I think the attention is due to them  as their uncle did so very well by Edward  We can ask your sisters some other year  you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more  I am sure you will like them; indeed  you do like them  you know  very much already  and so does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!
Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news 
No  ma am  What is it 
Something so strange! But you shall hear it all  When I got to Mr  Palmer s  I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child  She was sure it was very ill—it cried  and fretted  and was all over pimples  So I looked at it directly  and   Lord! my dear   says I   it is nothing in the world  but the red gum—  and nurse said just the same  But Charlotte  she would not be satisfied  so Mr  Donavan was sent for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street  so he stepped over directly  and as soon as ever he saw the child  he said just as we did  that it was nothing in the world but the red gum  and then Charlotte was easy  And so  just as he was going away again  it came into my head  I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it  but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news  So upon that  he smirked  and simpered  and looked grave  and seemed to know something or other  and at last he said in a whisper   For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister s indisposition  I think it advisable to say  that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs  Dashwood will do very well  
What! is Fanny ill 
[226] so this was kept a great secret  for fear of Mrs  Ferrars  and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very morning  poor Nancy  who  you know  is a well-meaning creature  but no conjurer  popt it all out   Lord!  thinks she to herself   they are all so fond of Lucy  to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;  and so  away she went to your sister  who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work  little suspecting what was to come—for she had just been saying to your brother  only five minutes before  that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord s daughter or other  I forget who  So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride  She fell into violent hysterics immediately  with such screams as reached your brother s ears  as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs  thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country  So up he flew directly  and a terrible scene took place  for Lucy was come to them by that time  little dreaming what was going on  Poor soul! I pity her  And I must say  I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury  and soon drove her into a fainting fit  Nancy  she fell upon her knees  and cried bitterly; and your brother  he walked about the room  and said he did not know what to do  Mrs  Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house  and your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too  to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes  Then she fell into hysterics again  and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr  Donavan  and Mr  Donavan found the house in all this uproar  The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away  and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition  he says  she could hardly walk; and Nancy  she was almost as bad  I declare  I have no patience with your sister; and I hope  with all my heart  it will be a match in spite of her  Lord! what a taking poor Mr  Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her  as well he may  I should not wonder  if he was to be in the greatest passion!—and Mr  Donavan thinks just the same  He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is  that he is gone back again to Harley Street  that he may be within call when Mrs  Ferrars is told of it  [227] for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house  for your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too; and so she may  for what I care  I have no pity for either of them  I have no notion of people s making such a to-do about money and greatness  There is no reason on earth why Mr  Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs  Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son  and though Lucy has next to nothing herself  she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say  if Mrs  Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year  she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight  Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours—or a little bigger—with two maids  and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid  for my Betty has a sister out of place  that would fit them exactly How long has this been known to you  Elinor  has he written to you 
I have known it these four months  When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November  she told me in confidence of her engagement 
Four months!—Have you known of this four months 
What!—while attending me in all my misery  has this been on your heart —And I have reproached you for being happy!
It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!
Four months!
So calm! so cheerful! how have you been supported 
By feeling that I was doing my duty  My promise to Lucy  obliged me to be secret  I owed it to her  therefore  to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends  not to create in them a solicitude about me  which it could not be in my power to satisfy 
I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother 
and once or twice I have attempted it; but without betraying my trust  I never could have convinced you 
Four months! and yet you loved him!
[230] that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built  And after all  Marianne  after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment  and all that can be said of one s happiness depending entirely on any particular person  it is not meant—it is not fit—it is not possible that it should be so  Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to her If such is your way of thinking 
if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else  your resolution  your self-command  are  perhaps  a little less to be wondered at  They are brought more within my comprehension 
[231] spirits at first  No  Marianne  Then  if I had not been bound to silence  perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely—not even what I owed to my dearest friends—from openly showing that I was very unhappy Oh! Elinor 
you have made me hate myself for ever  How barbarous have I been to you!—you  who have been my only comfort  who have borne with me in all my misery  who have seemed to be only suffering for me! Is this my gratitude  Is this the only return I can make you  Because your merit cries out upon myself  I have been trying to do it away 
Yes  ma am 
You have heard  I suppose 
of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday 
You have heard  I suppose 
You have heard  I suppose 
Your sister 
[233] distress—but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome  Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday  But I would not alarm you too much  Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one  and her resolution equal to any thing  She has borne it all  with the fortitude of an angel! She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one cannot wonder at it  after being so deceived!—meeting with such ingratitude  where so much kindness had been shown  so much confidence had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart  that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she thought they deserved some attention  were harmless  well-behaved girls  and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us  while your kind friend there  was attending her daughter  And now to be so rewarded!  I wish  with all my heart   says poor Fanny in her affectionate way   that we had asked your sisters instead of them  [234] twelve hundred; and in opposition to this  if he still persisted in this low connection  represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match  His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance  that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support  she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it Gracious God! can this be possible!
Well may you wonder  Marianne 
at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these  Your exclamation is very natural 
All this  however 
was urged in vain  Edward said very little; but what he did say  was in the most determined manner  Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement  He would stand to it  cost him what it might 
Then 
he has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon  Mr  Dashwood  but if he had done otherwise  I should have thought him a rascal  I have some little concern in the business  as well as yourself  for Lucy Steele is my cousin  and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world  nor one who more deserves a good husband 
[235] all wish her extremely happy; and Mrs  Ferrars s conduct throughout the whole  has been such as every conscientious  good mother  in like circumstances  would adopt  It has been dignified and liberal  Edward has drawn his own lot  and I fear it will be a bad one Well  sir 
and how did it end 
I am sorry to say  ma am  in a most unhappy rupture:—Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother s notice  He left her house yesterday  but where he is gone  or whether he is still in town  I do not know; for we of course can make no inquiry 
Poor young man!—and what is to become of him 
What  indeed  ma am! It is a melancholy consideration  Born to the prospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more deplorable  The interest of two thousand pounds—how can a man live on it —and when to that is added the recollection  that he might  but for his own folly  within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand  five hundred a-year  for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds   I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition  We must all feel for him; and the more so  because it is totally out of our power to assist him 
Poor young man!
I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I could see him  It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now  at lodgings and taverns 
If he would only have done as well by himself 
as all his friends were disposed to do by him  he might now have been in his proper situation  and would have wanted for nothing  But as it is  it must be out of anybody s power to assist him  And there is one thing more preparing against him  which must be worse than all—his mother has determined  with a very natural kind of spirit  to settle that estate upon Robert immediately  which might have been Edward s  on proper conditions  I left her this morning with her lawyer  talking over the business 
Well!
that is her revenge  Everybody has a way of their own  But I don t think mine would be  to make one son independent  because another had plagued me 
Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man 
than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own  Poor Edward! I feel for him sincerely 
Get it all out of her  my dear  She will tell you any thing if you ask  You see I cannot leave Mrs  Clarke 
I am so glad to meet you;
for I wanted to see you of all things in the world 
I suppose Mrs  Jennings has heard all about it  Is she angry 
Not at all  I believe  with you 
That is a good thing  And Lady Middleton  is she angry 
I cannot suppose it possible that she should 
I am monstrous glad of it  Good gracious! I have had such a time of it! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life  She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet  nor do any thing else for me again  so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to  and we are as good friends as ever  Look  she made me this bow to my hat  and put in the feather last night  There now  you are going to laugh at me too  But why should not I wear pink ribbons  I do not care if it is the Doctor s favourite colour  I am sure  for my part  I should never have known he did like it better than any other colour  if he had not happened to say so  My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them 
Well  but Miss Dashwood 
people may say what they choose about Mr  Ferrars s declaring he would not have Lucy  for it is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured reports to be spread abroad  Whatever Lucy might think about it herself  you know  it was no business of other people to set it down for certain 
I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before  I assure you 
She put in the feather last night 
She put in the feather last night 
[241] and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks  that nobody in their senses could expect Mr  Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton  with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune  for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself  And besides that  my cousin Richard said himself  that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr  Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days  I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother s Wednesday  and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday  Friday  and Saturday  and did not know what was become of him  Once Lucy thought to write to him  but then her spirits rose against that  However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came out  how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street  and been talked to by his mother and all of them  and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy  and nobody but Lucy would he have  And how he had been so worried by what passed  that as soon as he had went away from his mother s house  he had got upon his horse  and rid into the country  some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday  on purpose to get the better of it  And after thinking it all over and over again  he said  it seemed to him as if  now he had no fortune  and no nothing at all  it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement  because it must be for her loss  for he had nothing but two thousand pounds  and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders  as he had some thoughts  he could get nothing but a curacy  and how was they to live upon that —He could not bear to think of her doing no better  and so he begged  if she had the least mind for it  to put an end to the matter directly  and leave him shift for himself  I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be  And it was entirely for her sake  and upon her account  that he said a word about being off  and not upon his own  I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her  or of wishing to marry Miss Morton  or any thing like it  But  to be sure  Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly  with a great deal about sweet and love  you know  and all [242] that—Oh  la! one can t repeat such kind of things you know —she told him directly  she had not the least mind in the world to be off  for she could live with him upon a trifle  and how little so ever he might have  she should be very glad to have it all  you know  or something of the kind  So then he was monstrous happy  and talked on some time about what they should do  and they agreed he should take orders directly  and they must wait to be married till he got a living  And just then I could not hear any more  for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs  Richardson was come in her coach  and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them  to ask Lucy if she would like to go  but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them 
you were all in the same room together  were not you 
No  indeed  not us  La! Miss Dashwood  do you think people make love when any body else is by  Oh  for shame!—To be sure you must know better than that   Laughing affectedly  —No  no; they were shut up in the drawing-room together  and all I heard was only by listening at the door 
How!
have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door  I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself  How could you behave so unfairly by your sister 
Oh  la! there is nothing in that  I only stood at the door  and heard what I could  And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me; for a year or two back  when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together  she never made any bones of hiding in a closet  or behind a chimney-board  on purpose to hear what we said 
Edward talks of going to Oxford soon 
[244] brother and sister were not very kind! However  I shan t say anything against them to you; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot  which was more than I looked for  And for my part  I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but  however  nothing was said about them  and I took care to keep mine out of sight  Edward have got some business at Oxford  he says; so he must go there for a time; and after that  as soon as he can light upon a Bishop  he will be ordained  I wonder what curacy he will get! Good gracious!  giggling as she spoke  I d lay my life I know what my cousins will say  when they hear of it  They will tell me I should write to the Doctor  to get Edward the curacy of his new living  I know they will; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world   La!  I shall say directly   I wonder how you could think of such a thing  I write to the Doctor  indeed! Well 
it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst  You have got your answer ready 
Oh  la! here come the Richardsons  I had a vast deal more to say to you  but I must not stay away from them not any longer  I assure you they are very genteel people  He makes a monstrous deal of money  and they keep their own coach  I have not time to speak to Mrs  Jennings about it myself  but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us  and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away  and Mrs  Jennings should want company  I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes  I suppose Lady Middleton won t ask us any more this bout  Good-bye; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here  Remember me kindly to her  La! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!—I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn 
Wait for his having a living!—ay  we all know how that will end:—they will wait a twelvemonth  and finding no good comes of it  will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year  with the interest of his two thousand pounds  and what little matter Mr  Steele and Mr  Pratt can give her  Then they will have a child every year! and Lord help  em! how poor they will be!—I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house  Two maids and two men  indeed!—as I talked of t other day  No  no  they must get a stout girl of all works  Betty s sister would never do for them now 
 I am  etc   etc 
Very well indeed!—how prettily she writes!—aye  that was quite proper to let him be off if he would  That was just like Lucy  Poor soul! I wish I could get him a living  with all my heart  She calls me dear Mrs  Jennings  you see  She is a good-hearted girl as ever lived  Very well upon my word  That sentence is very prettily turned  Yes  yes  I will go and see her  sure enough  How attentive she is  to think of every body!—Thank you  my dear  for showing it me  It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw  and does Lucy s head and heart great credit 
Cleveland!
No  I cannot go to Cleveland 
You forget 
that its situation is not—that it is not in the neighbourhood of—
But it is in Somersetshire  I cannot go into Somersetshire  There  where I looked forward to going;—no  Elinor  you cannot expect me to go there 
Ah! Colonel  I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods;
for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;—and how forlorn we shall be  when I come back!—Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats 
I am afraid it cannot take place very soon 
Lord! what should hinder it 
This is very strange!—sure he need not wait to be older 
I shall always think myself very much obliged to you 
I have heard 
of the injustice your friend Mr  Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand the matter right  he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman  Have I been rightly informed —Is it so —
The cruelty  the impolitic cruelty 
[250] long attached to each other  is terrible  Mrs  Ferrars does not know what she may be doing—what she may drive her son to  I have seen Mr  Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street  and am much pleased with him  He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time  but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake  and as a friend of yours  I wish it still more  I understand that he intends to take orders  Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford  now just vacant  as I am informed by this day s post  is his  if he think it worth his acceptance—but that  perhaps  so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now  it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable  It is a rectory  but a small one; the late incumbent  I believe  did not make more than 200 L per annum  and though it is certainly capable of improvement  I fear  not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income  Such as it is  however  my pleasure in presenting him to it  will be very great  Pray assure him of it The smallness of the house 
I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them  for it will be in proportion to their family and income 
This little rectory can do no more than make Mr  Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry  I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive  If  however  by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther  I must think very differently of him from what I now do  if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present  What I am now doing indeed  seems nothing at all  since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal  his only object of happiness  His marriage must still be a distant good;—at least  I am afraid it cannot take place very soon 
Well  Miss Dashwood 
I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you; for though  upon my honour  I tried to keep out of hearing  I could not help catching enough to understand his business  And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life  and I wish you joy of it with all my heart 
Thank you  ma am 
It is a matter of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly  There are not many men who would act as he has done  Few people who have so compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life 
Lord! my dear  you are very modest  I an t the least astonished at it in the world  for I have often thought of late  there was nothing more likely to happen 
You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel s general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur 
Opportunity!
Oh! as to that  when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing  somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity  Well  my dear  I wish you joy of it again and again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world  I think I shall soon know where to look for them 
You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose 
Aye  my dear  that I do  indeed  And as to the house being a bad one  I do not know what the Colonel would be at  for it is as good a one as ever I saw 
He spoke of its being out of repair 
Well  and whose fault is that  why don t he repair it  who should do it but himself 
[253] my talk out  But  however  we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be quite alone  I do not ask you to go with me  for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides  you must long to tell your sister all about it Certainly  ma am  I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else 
Oh! very well 
Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy  for I think of going as far as Holborn to-day 
No  ma am  not even Lucy if you please  One day s delay will not be very material; and till I have written to Mr  Ferrars  I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else  I shall do that directly  It is of importance that no time should be lost with him  for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination 
Oh  ho! I understand you  Mr  Ferrars is to be the man  Well  so much the better for him  Ay  to be sure  he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you  But  my dear  is not this rather out of character  Should not the Colonel write himself  Sure  he is the proper person 
Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man  that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr  Ferrars than himself 
And so you are forced to do it  Well that is an odd kind of delicacy! However  I will not disturb you  seeing her preparing to write   You know your own concerns best  So good-bye  my dear  I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed 
[254] should be very glad to get her so good a mistress  But whether she would do for a lady s maid  I am sure I can t tell  She is an excellent housemaid  and works very well at her needle  However  you will think of all that at your leisure Certainly  ma am 
Mrs  Jennings told me 
[255] will most likely be some time—it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again  I go to Oxford tomorrow You would not have gone  however 
without receiving our good wishes  even if we had not been able to give them in person  Mrs  Jennings was quite right in what she said  I have something of consequence to inform you of  which I was on the point of communicating by paper  I am charged with a most agreeable office  breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke   Colonel Brandon  who was here only ten minutes ago  has desired me to say  that understanding you mean to take orders  he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant  and only wishes it were more valuable  Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well-judging a friend  and to join in his wish that the living—it is about two hundred a-year—were much more considerable  and such as might better enable you to—as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself—such  in short  as might establish all your views of happiness 
Colonel Brandon!
Yes 
Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed—for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you—a concern which I am sure Marianne  myself  and all your friends  must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character  and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion 
Colonel Brandon give me a living!—Can it be possible 
The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where 
No 
[256] I owe it all  I feel it—I would express it if I could—but  as you well know  I am no orator You are very much mistaken  I do assure you that you owe it entirely  at least almost entirely  to your own merit  and Colonel Brandon s discernment of it  I have had no hand in it  I did not even know  till I understood his design  that the living was vacant; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift  As a friend of mine  of my family  he may  perhaps—indeed I know he has  still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but  upon my word  you owe nothing to my solicitation 
Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability  I have always heard him spoken of as such  and your brother I know esteems him highly  He is undoubtedly a sensible man  and in his manners perfectly the gentleman 
Indeed 
I believe that you will find him  on farther acquaintance  all that you have heard him to be  and as you will be such very near neighbours  for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house   it is particularly important that he should be all this 
Colonel Brandon  I think  lodges in St  James Street 
I must hurry away then  to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give you; to assure him that he has made me a very—an exceedingly happy man 
When I see him again 
I shall see him the husband of Lucy 
Well  my dear 
I sent you up the young man  Did not I do right —And I suppose you had no great difficulty—You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal 
No  ma am; that was not very likely 
Well  and how soon will he be ready —For it seems all to depend upon that 
Really 
I know so little of these kind of forms  that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time  or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination 
Two or three months!
Lord! my dear  how calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord bless me!—I am sure it would put me quite out of patience!—And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr  Ferrars  I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him  Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in orders already 
My dear ma am 
what can you be thinking of  Why  Colonel Brandon s only object is to be of use to Mr  Ferrars 
Lord bless you  my dear! Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr  Ferrars!
Aye  aye  the parsonage is but a small one 
and very likely may be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising  as I thought  for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor  and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds! and to you too  that had been used to live in Barton cottage! It seems quite ridiculous  But  my dear  we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage  and make it comfortable for them  before Lucy goes to it 
But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living s being enough to allow them to marry 
The Colonel is a ninny  my dear; because he has two thousand a-year himself  he thinks that nobody else can marry on less  Take my word for it  that  if I am alive  I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan t go if Lucy an t there 
Fanny is in her own room  I suppose 
[261] and Marianne were always great favourites  Why would not Marianne come I am not sorry to see you alone 
for I have a good deal to say to you  This living of Colonel Brandon s—can it be true —has he really given it to Edward —I heard it yesterday by chance  and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it 
It is perfectly true  Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward 
Really!—Well  this is very astonishing!—no relationship!—no connection between them!—and now that livings fetch such a price!—what was the value of this 
About two hundred a year 
Very well—and for the next presentation to a living of that value—supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly  and likely to vacate it soon—he might have got I dare say—fourteen hundred pounds  And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person s death  Now indeed it would be too late to sell it  but a man of Colonel Brandon s sense!—I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common  such natural  concern!—Well  I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character  I suppose  however—on recollection—that the case may probably be this  Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation  is old enough to take it  Aye  aye  that is the fact  depend upon it 
It is truly astonishing!
what could be the Colonel s motive 
A very simple one—to be of use to Mr  Ferrars 
Well  well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be  Edward is a very lucky man  You will not mention the matter to Fanny  however  for though I have broke it to her  and she bears it vastly well —she will not like to hear it much talked of 
Mrs  Ferrars 
knows nothing about it at present  and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be  When the marriage takes place  I fear she must hear of it all 
But why should such precaution be used  Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs  Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon —for that must be quite out of the question; yet why  upon her late behaviour  is she supposed to feel at all  She has done with her son  she cast him off for ever  and has made all those over whom she had any influence  cast him off likewise  Surely  after doing so  she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account—she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him  She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child  and yet retain the anxiety of a parent!
Ah! Elinor 
your reasoning is very good  but it is founded on ignorance of human nature  When Edward s unhappy match takes place  depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him; and  therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event  must be concealed from her as much as possible  Mrs  Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son 
You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by this time 
You wrong her exceedingly  Mrs  Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world 
We think now 
of Robert s marrying Miss Morton 
The lady  I suppose  has no choice in the affair 
Choice!—how do you mean 
I only mean that I suppose  from your manner of speaking  it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert 
Certainly  there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;—and as to any thing else  they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one is superior to the other 
Of one thing  my dear sister 
I may assure you; and I will do it  because I know it must gratify you  I have good reason to think—indeed I have it from the best authority  or I should not repeat it  for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it —but I have it from the very best authority —not that I ever precisely heard Mrs  Ferrars say it herself—but her daughter did  and I have it from her —that in short  whatever objections there might be against a certain—a certain connection  you understand me —it would have been far preferable to her  it would not have given her half the vexation that this does  I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs  Ferrars considered it in that light; a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all   It would have been beyond comparison   she said   the least evil of the two  and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse   But however  all that is quite out of the question —not to be thought of or mentioned  As to any attachment you know  it never could be; all that is gone by  But I thought I would just tell you of this  because I knew how much it must please you  Not that you have any reason to regret  my dear Elinor  There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well —quite as well  or better  perhaps  all things considered  Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately 
Of one thing I may assure you 
Of one thing I may assure you 
We may treat it as a joke 
[266] occasion  but as for myself  I must say  that if Edward does marry this young woman  I never will see him again   That was what I said immediately  I was most uncommonly shocked  indeed! Poor Edward! he has done for himself completely —shut himself out for ever from all decent society! but  as I directly said to my mother  I am not in the least surprised at it; from his style of education  it was always to be expected  My poor mother was half frantic Have you ever seen the lady 
Yes; once  while she was staying in this house  I happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her  The merest awkward country girl  without style  or elegance  and almost without beauty  I remember her perfectly  Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward  I offered immediately  as soon as my mother related the affair to me  to talk to him myself  and dissuade him from the match; but it was too late then  I found  to do any thing  for unluckily  I was not in the way at first  and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place  when it was not for me  you know  to interfere  But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier  I think it is most probable that something might have been hit on  I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light   My dear fellow   I should have said   consider what you are doing  You are making a most disgraceful connection  and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving   I cannot help thinking  in short  that means might have been found  But now it is all too late  He must be starved  you know  that is certain; absolutely starved 
infection
Is mama coming —
Not yet 
but she will be here  I hope  before it is long  It is a great way  you know  from hence to Barton 
But she must not go round by London 
I shall never see her  if she goes by London 
I entreat you to stay 
Opened a window-shutter 
Miss Dashwood  for half an hour—for ten minutes—I entreat you to stay 
No  sir 
I shall not stay  Your business cannot be with me  The servants  I suppose  forgot to tell you that Mr  Palmer was not in the house 
Had they told me 
that Mr  Palmer and all his relations were at the devil  it would not have turned me from the door  My business is with you  and only you 
With me!
well  sir—be quick—and if you can—less violent 
Sit down  and I will be both 
Pray be quick  sir 
I have no time to spare 
Your sister 
is out of danger  I heard it from the servant  God be praised!—But is it true  is it really true 
For God s sake tell me  is she out of danger  or is she not 
I entreat you to stay 
I entreat you to stay 
We hope she is 
Had I known as much half an hour ago—But since I am here 
what does it signify —For once  Miss Dashwood—it will be the last time  perhaps—let us be cheerful together  I am in a fine mood for gaiety  Tell me honestly 
do you think me most a knave or a fool 
Mr  Willoughby  I advise you at present to return to Combe—I am not at leisure to remain with you longer  Whatever your business may be with me  it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow 
I understand you 
yes  I am very drunk  A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me 
At Marlborough!
Yes —I left London this morning at eight o clock  and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough 
Mr  Willoughby  you ought to feel  and I certainly do  that after what has passed—your coming here in this manner  and forcing yourself upon my notice  requires a very particular excuse  What is it  that you mean by it 
I mean 
[286] always a rascal  to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma——  from your sister Is this the real reason of your coming 
Upon my soul it is 
If that is all  you may be satisfied already; for Marianne does  she has long forgiven you 
Has she 
Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it  But she shall forgive me again  and on more reasonable grounds  Now will you listen to me 
I do not know 
how you may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister  or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me  Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me —it is worth the trial however  and you shall hear every thing  When I first became intimate in your family  I had no other intention  no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire  more pleasantly than I had ever done before  Your sister s lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first  was of a kind—It is astonishing  when I reflect on what it was  and what she was  that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must confess  my vanity only was elevated by it  Careless of her happiness  thinking only of my own amusement  giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging  I endeavoured  by every means in my power  to make myself pleasing to her  without any design of returning her affection 
It is hardly worth while  Mr  Willoughby  for you to relate  or for me to listen any longer  Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing  Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject 
I insist on you hearing the whole of it 
[287] than myself  Every year since my coming of age  or even before  I believe  had added to my debts; and though the death of my old cousin  Mrs  Smith  was to set me free; yet that event being uncertain  and possibly far distant  it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune  To attach myself to your sister  therefore  was not a thing to be thought of; and with a meanness  selfishness  cruelty  which no indignant  no contemptuous look  even of yours  Miss Dashwood  can ever reprobate too much —I was acting in this manner  trying to engage her regard  without a thought of returning it  But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity  I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated  because I did not then know what it was to love  But have I ever known it  Well may it be doubted; for  had I really loved  could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity  to avarice  or  what is more  could I have sacrificed hers  But I have done it  To avoid a comparative poverty  which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors  I have  by raising myself to affluence  lost every thing that could make it a blessing You did then 
believe yourself at one time attached to her 
[288] display  But in the interim—in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass  before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private—a circumstance occurred—an unlucky circumstance—to ruin all my resolution  and with it all my comfort  A discovery took place Mrs  Smith had somehow or other been informed  I imagine by some distant relation  whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour  of an affair  a connection—but I need not explain myself farther 
your particular intimacy—you have probably heard the whole story long ago 
I have 
I have heard it all  And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business  I confess is beyond my comprehension 
Remember 
from whom you received the account  Could it be an impartial one  I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me  I do not mean to justify myself  but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge—that because she was injured she was irreproachable  and because I was a libertine  she must be a saint  If the violence of her passions  the weakness of her understanding—I do not mean  however  to defend myself  Her affection for me deserved better treatment  and I often  with great self-reproach  recall the tenderness which  for a very short time  had the power of creating any return  I wish—I heartily wish it had never been  But I have injured more than herself; and I have injured one  whose affection for me— may I say it   was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind—Oh! how infinitely superior!
Your indifference  however  towards that unfortunate girl—I must say it  unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be—your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her  Do not think yourself excused by any weakness  any natural defect of understanding on her side  in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours  You must have known  that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes  always gay  always happy  she was reduced to the extremest indigence 
But  upon my soul  I did not know it 
[289] did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sense might have told her how to find it out Well  sir  and what said Mrs  Smith 
She taxed me with the offence at once  and my confusion may be guessed  The purity of her life  the formality of her notions  her ignorance of the world —every thing was against me  The matter itself I could not deny  and vain was every endeavour to soften it  She was previously disposed  I believe  to doubt the morality of my conduct in general  and was moreover discontented with the very little attention  the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her  in my present visit  In short  it ended in a total breach  By one measure I might have saved myself  In the height of her morality  good woman! she offered to forgive the past  if I would marry Eliza  That could not be; and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house  The night following this affair—I was to go the next morning—was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be  The struggle was great  but it ended too soon  My affection for Marianne  my thorough conviction of her attachment to me—it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty  or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches  which I was naturally inclined to feel  and expensive society had increased  I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife  if I chose to address her  and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do  A heavy scene however awaited me  before I could leave Devonshire: I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement  But whether I should write this apology  or deliver it in person  was a point of long debate  To see Marianne  I felt  would be dreadful  and I even doubted whether I could see her again  and keep to my resolution  In that point  however  I undervalued my own magnanimity  as the event declared; for I went  I saw her  and saw her miserable  and left her miserable;—and left her hoping never to see her again 
Why did you call  Mr  Willoughby 
a note would have answered every purpose  Why was it necessary to call 
I was formally dismissed 
It was necessary to my own pride  I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you  or the rest of the neighbourhood  to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs  Smith and myself  and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage  in my way to Honiton  The sight of your dear sister  however  was really dreadful; and  to heighten the matter  I found her alone  You were all gone I do not know where  I had left her only the evening before  so fully  so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how happy  how gay were my spirits  as I walked from the cottage to Allenham  satisfied with myself  delighted with every body! But in this  our last interview of friendship  I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling  Her sorrow  her disappointment  her deep regret  when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately—I never shall forget it—united too with such reliance  such confidence in me! Oh  God! what a hard-hearted rascal I was!
Did you tell her that you should soon return 
I do not know what I told her 
less than was due to the past  beyond a doubt  and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future  I cannot think of it  It won t do  Then came your dear mother to torture me farther  with all her kindness and confidence  Thank Heaven! it did torture me  I was miserable  Miss Dashwood  you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery  I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid  rascally folly of my own heart  that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now  Well  I went  left all that I loved  and went to those to whom  at best  I was only indifferent  My journey to town—travelling with my own horses  and therefore so tediously—no creature to speak to—my own reflections so cheerful—when I looked forward every thing so inviting!—when I looked back at Barton  the picture so soothing!—oh  it was a blessed journey!
Well  sir 
and this is all 
Ah!—no —have you forgot what passed in town  That infamous letter  Did she show it you 
Yes  I saw every note that passed 
When the first of hers reached me  as it immediately did  for I was in town the whole time   what I felt is  in the common phrase  not to be expressed; in a more simple one—perhaps too simple to raise any emotion  my feelings were very  very painful  Every line  every word was—in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer  were she here  would forbid—a dagger to my heart  To know that Marianne was in town was  in the same language  a thunderbolt  Thunderbolts and daggers! what a reproof would she have given me! her taste  her opinions—I believe they are better known to me than my own  and I am sure they are dearer 
This is not right  Mr  Willoughby  Remember that you are married  Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear 
[293] I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street; but at last  judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool  common acquaintance than anything else  I watched you all safely out of the house one morning  and left my name Watched us out of the house!
Even so  You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you  how often I was on the point of falling in with you  I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight  as the carriage drove by  Lodging as I did in Bond Street  there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side  a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight  could have separated us so long  I avoided the Middletons as much as possible  as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common  Not aware of their being in town  however  I blundered on Sir John  I believe  the first day of his coming  and the day after I had called at Mrs  Jennings s  He asked me to a party  a dance at his house in the evening  Had he not told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there  I should have felt it too certain a thing  to trust myself near him  The next morning brought another short note from Marianne—still affectionate  open  artless  confiding—everything that could make my conduct most hateful  I could not answer it  I tried—but could not frame a sentence  But I thought of her  I believe  every moment of the day  If you can pity me  Miss Dashwood  pity my situation as it was then  With my head and heart full of your sister  I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman! Those three or four weeks were worse than all  Well  at last  as I need not tell you  you were forced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony it was! Marianne  beautiful as an angel on one side  calling me Willoughby in such a tone! Oh  God! holding out her hand to me  asking me for an explanation  with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face! and Sophia  jealous as the devil on the other hand  looking all that was—Well  it does not signify; it is over now  Such an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not before I had seen Marianne s sweet face as white as death  That was the last  last look I ever had of her; the last manner in which she appeared to me  It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying  it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those  who saw her last in this world  She was before me  constantly before me  as I travelled  in the same look and hue 
I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight 
I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight 
Well  let me make haste and be gone  Your sister is certainly better  certainly out of danger 
We are assured of it 
Your poor mother  too!—doting on Marianne 
But the letter  Mr  Willoughby  your own letter; have you any thing to say about that 
Yes  yes  that in particular  Your sister wrote to me again  you know  the very next morning  You saw what she said  I was breakfasting at the Ellisons —and her letter  with some others  was brought to me there from my lodgings  It happened to catch Sophia s eye before it caught mine;—and its size  the elegance of the paper  the hand-writing altogether  immediately gave her a suspicion  Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire  and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was  and made her more jealous than ever  Affecting that air of playfulness  therefore  which is delightful in a woman one loves  she opened the letter directly  and read its contents  She was well paid for her impudence  She read what made her wretched  Her wretchedness I could have borne  but her passion—her malice—at all events it must be appeased  And  in short  what do you think of my wife s style of letter-writing —delicate—tender—truly feminine—was it not 
Your wife! The letter was in your own hand-writing 
[296] her friends  in what language my answer was couched  It must have been only to one end  My business was to declare myself a scoundrel  and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance   I am ruined for ever in their opinion   said I to myself;  I am shut out for ever from their society  they already think me an unprincipled fellow  this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one   Such were my reasonings  as  in a sort of desperate carelessness  I copied my wife s words  and parted with the last relics of Marianne  Her three notes—unluckily they were all in my pocket-book  or I should have denied their existence  and hoarded them for ever—I was forced to put them up  and could not even kiss them  And the lock of hair—that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book  which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence —the dear lock—all  every memento was torn from me You are very wrong  Mr  Willoughby  very blamable 
you ought not to speak in this way  either of Mrs  Willoughby or my sister  You had made your own choice  It was not forced on you  Your wife has a claim to your politeness  to your respect  at least  She must be attached to you  or she would not have married you  To treat her with unkindness  to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne—nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience 
Do not talk to me of my wife 
She does not deserve your compassion  She knew I had no regard for her when we married  Well  married we were  and came down to Combe Magna to be happy  and afterwards returned to town to be gay  And now do you pity me  Miss Dashwood  or have I said all this to no purpose  Am I —be it only one degree —am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before  My intentions were not always wrong  Have I explained away any part of my guilt 
Yes  you have certainly removed something—a little  You have proved yourself  on the whole  less faulty than I had believed you  You have proved your heart less wicked  much less wicked  But I hardly know—the misery that you have inflicted—I hardly know what could have made it worse 
[297] telling you —Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours  You tell me that she has forgiven me already  Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart  and of my present feelings  will draw from her a more spontaneous  more natural  more gentle  less dignified  forgiveness  Tell her of my misery and my penitence—tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her  and if you will  that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called  your justification  But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now  nor how you heard of her illness 
Last night  in Drury Lane lobby  I ran against Sir John Middleton  and when he saw who I was  for the first time these two months—he spoke to me  That he had cut me ever since my marriage  I had seen without surprise or resentment  Now  however  his good-natured  honest  stupid soul  full of indignation against me  and concern for your sister  could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to  though probably he did not think it would  vex me horridly  As bluntly as he could speak it  therefore  he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland—a letter that morning received from Mrs  Jennings declared her danger most imminent—the Palmers are all gone off in a fright  &c  I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John  His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his ill-will was done away  that when we parted  he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy  What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying  and dying too  believing me the greatest villain upon earth  scorning  hating me in her latest moments—for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed  One person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing  What I felt was dreadful! My resolution was soon made  and at eight o clock this morning I was in my carriage  Now you know all 
There is no use in staying here; I must be off 
Are you going back to town 
No—to Combe Magna  I have business there; from thence to town in a day or two  Good bye 
And you do think something better of me than you did 
As to that 
I must rub through the world as well as I can  Domestic happiness is out of the question  If  however  I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions  it may be the means—it may put me on my guard—at least  it may be something to live for  Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever  Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again—
Well 
once more good bye  I shall now go away and live in dread of one event 
What do you mean 
Your sister s marriage 
You are very wrong  She can never be more lost to you than she is now 
But she will be gained by some one else  And if that some one should be the very he whom  of all others  I could least bear—but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate good-will  by showing that where I have most injured I can least forgive  Good bye —God bless you!
poor Willoughby 
At last we are alone  My Elinor  you do not yet know all my happiness  Colonel Brandon loves Marianne  He has told me so himself 
[302] Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled  It came out quite unawares  quite undesignedly  I  you may well believe  could talk of nothing but my child;—he could not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own  and he perhaps  thinking that mere friendship  as the world now goes  would not justify so warm a sympathy—or rather  not thinking at all  I suppose—giving way to irresistible feelings  made me acquainted with his earnest  tender  constant  affection for Marianne  He has loved her  my Elinor  ever since the first moment of seeing her 
His regard for her  infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned  as much more warm  as more sincere or constant  which ever we are to call it  has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne s unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man! and without selfishness  without encouraging a hope! could he have seen her happy with another  Such a noble mind! such openness  such sincerity! No one can be deceived in him 
Colonel Brandon s character 
as an excellent man  is well established 
I know it is 
or after such a warning  I should be the last to encourage such affection  or even to be pleased by it  But his coming for me as he did  with such active  such ready friendship  is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men 
His character  however 
[303] known; they equally love and respect him; and even my own knowledge of him  though lately acquired  is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him  that if Marianne can be happy with him  I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world  What answer did you give him  Did you allow him to hope Oh! my love  I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself  Marianne might at that moment be dying  But he did not ask for hope or encouragement  His was an involuntary confidence  an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend  not an application to a parent  Yet after a time I did say  for at first I was quite overcome  that if she lived  as I trusted she might  my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage; and since our arrival  since our delightful security  I have repeated it to him more fully  have given him every encouragement in my power  Time  a very little time  I tell him  will do everything; Marianne s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby  His own merits must soon secure it 
To judge from the Colonel s spirits  however  you have not yet made him equally sanguine 
No  He thinks Marianne s affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time  and even supposing her heart again free  is too diffident of himself to believe  that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her  There  however  he is quite mistaken  His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage  as to make his character and principles fixed;—and his disposition  I am well convinced  is exactly the very one to make your sister happy  And his person  his manners too  are all in his favour  My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby—but at the same time  there is something much more pleasing in his countenance  There was always a something —if you remember —in Willoughby s eyes at times  which I did not like 
[304] Marianne  Their gentleness  their genuine attention to other people  and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition  than the liveliness—often artificial  and often ill-timed of the other  I am very sure myself  that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable  as he has proved himself the contrary  Marianne would yet never have been so happy with him as she will be with Colonel Brandon At Delaford  she will be within an easy distance of me 
even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability —for I hear it is a large village —indeed there certainly must be some small house or cottage close by  that would suit us quite as well as our present situation 
His fortune too!—for at my time of life you know  everybody cares about that;—and though I neither know nor desire to know  what it really is  I am sure it must be a good one 
When the weather is settled  and I have recovered my strength 
we will take long walks together every day  We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down  and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John s new plantations at Barton Cross  and the Abbeyland; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory  and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached  I know we shall be happy  I know the summer will pass happily away  I mean never to be later in rising than six  and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading  I have formed my plan  and am determined to enter on a course of serious study  Our own library is too well known to me  to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement  But there are many works well worth reading at the Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon  By reading only six hours a-day  I shall gain in the course of a twelvemonth a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want 
And see how the children go on 
And see how the children go on 
There  exactly there 
on that projecting mound —there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby 
I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot! shall we ever talk on that subject  Elinor 
Or will it be wrong  I can talk of it now  I hope  as I ought to do 
As for regret 
I have done with that  as far as he is concerned  I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him  but what they are now  At present  if I could be satisfied on one point  if I could be allowed to think that he was not always acting a part  not always deceiving me; but above all  if I could be assured that he never was so very wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him  since the story of that unfortunate girl—
If you could be assured of that  you think you should be easy 
Yes  My peace of mind is doubly involved in it; for not only is it horrible to suspect a person  who has been what he has been to me  of such designs  but what must it make me appear to myself  What in a situation like mine  but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to—
How then 
would you account for his behaviour 
I would suppose him—Oh  how gladly would I suppose him!—only fickle  very  very fickle 
I am not wishing him too much good 
when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own  He will suffer enough in them 
Do you compare your conduct with his 
No  I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with yours 
Our situations have borne little resemblance 
[311] some duty neglected  or some failing indulged  Every body seemed injured by me  The kindness  the unceasing kindness of Mrs  Jennings  I had repaid with ungrateful contempt  To the Middletons  to the Palmers  the Steeles  to every common acquaintance even  I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened against their merits  and a temper irritated by their very attention  To John  to Fanny  yes  even to them  little as they deserve  I had given less than their due  But you  you above all  above my mother  had been wronged by me  I  and only I  knew your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me —not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself  Your example was before me; but to what avail  Was I more considerate of you and your comfort  Did I imitate your forbearance  or lessen your restraints  by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone  No; not less when I knew you to be unhappy  than when I had believed you at ease  did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me  regretting only that heart which had deserted and wronged me  and leaving you  for I professed an unbounded affection  to be miserable for my sake [312] by no change of circumstances or opinions  But it shall be regulated  it shall be checked by religion  by reason  by constant employment If I could but know his heart  everything would become easy 
Tell mama 
I wish to assure you both 
that I see every thing—as you can desire me to do 
It is a great relief to me—what Elinor told me this morning—I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear 
[314] satisfied  I wish for no change  I never could have been happy with him  after knowing  as sooner or later I must have known  all this  I should have had no confidence  no esteem  Nothing could have done it away to my feelings I know it—I know it 
Happy with a man of libertine practices!—With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends  and the best of men!—No—my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!—Her conscience  her sensitive conscience  would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt 
I wish for no change 
You consider the matter 
exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive  as well as myself  not only in this  but in many other circumstances  reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments  in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection  on his side  much less certain  Had you married  you must have been always poor  His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself  and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him  His demands and your inexperience together  on a small  very small income  must have brought on distresses which would not be the less grievous to you  from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before  Your sense of honour and honesty would have led you  I know  when aware of your situation  to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and  perhaps  as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort  you might have been suffered to practice it  but beyond that—and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage  beyond that  had you endeavoured  however reasonably  to abridge his enjoyments  is it not to be feared  that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it  you would have lessened your own influence on his heart  and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties 
Selfish 
do you really think him selfish 
The whole of his behaviour 
[315] beginning to the end of the affair  has been grounded on selfishness  It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which afterwards  when his own were engaged  made him delay the confession of it  and which finally carried him from Barton  His own enjoyment  or his own ease  was  in every particular  his ruling principle It is very true  My happiness never was his object 
At present 
he regrets what he has done  And why does he regret it —Because he finds it has not answered towards himself  It has not made him happy  His circumstances are now unembarrassed—he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself  But does it follow that had he married you  he would have been happy —The inconveniences would have been different  He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which  because they are removed  he now reckons as nothing  He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint  but he would have been always necessitous—always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance  even to domestic happiness  than the mere temper of a wife 
I have not a doubt of it 
and I have nothing to regret—nothing but my own folly 
Rather say your mother s imprudence  my child 
she must be answerable 
One observation may  I think  be fairly drawn from the whole of the story—that all Willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue  in his behaviour to Eliza Williams  That crime has been the origin of every lesser one  and of all his present discontents 
We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward  and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject  but conclude him to be still at Oxford
I suppose you know  ma am  that Mr  Ferrars is married 
I suppose you know  ma am  that Mr  Ferrars is married 
I suppose you know  ma am  that Mr  Ferrars is married 
Who told you that Mr  Ferrars was married  Thomas 
I see Mr  Ferrars myself  ma am  this morning in Exeter  and his lady too  Miss Steele as was  They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn  as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother  who is one of the post-boys  I happened to look up as I went by the chaise  and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat  and she knew me and called to me  and inquired after you  ma am  and the young ladies  especially Miss Marianne  and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr  Ferrars s  their best compliments and service  and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you  but they was in a great hurry to go forwards  for they was going further down for a little while  but however  when they come back  they d make sure to come and see you 
But did she tell you she was married  Thomas 
Yes  ma am  She smiled  and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts  She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady  and very civil behaved  So  I made free to wish her joy 
Was Mr  Ferrars in the carriage with her 
Yes  ma am  I just see him leaning back in it  but he did not look up;—he never was a gentleman much for talking 
Was there no one else in the carriage 
No  ma am  only they two 
Do you know where they came from 
They come straight from town  as Miss Lucy—Mrs  Ferrars told me 
And are they going farther westward 
Yes  ma am—but not to bide long  They will soon be back again  and then they d be sure and call here 
Did you see them off  before you came away 
No  ma am—the horses were just coming out  but I could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late 
Did Mrs  Ferrars look well 
Yes  ma am  she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady—and she seemed vastly contented 
When do you write to Colonel Brandon  ma am 
I wrote to him  my love  last week  and rather expect to see  than to hear from him again  I earnestly pressed his coming to us  and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow  or any day 
He comes from Mr  Pratt s purposely to see us  I will be calm  I will be mistress of myself 
Is Mrs  Ferrars at Longstaple 
At Longstaple!
No  my mother is in town 
I meant 
to inquire for Mrs  Edward Ferrars 
Perhaps you mean—my brother—you mean Mrs —Mrs  Robert Ferrars 
Mrs  Robert Ferrars!
Perhaps you do not know—you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to—to the youngest—to Miss Lucy Steele 
Yes 
they were married last week  and are now at Dawlish 
It was a foolish  idle inclination on my side 
[326] for me to be very often at Longstaple  where I always felt myself at home  and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging  She was pretty too—at least I thought so then; and I had seen so little of other women  that I could make no comparisons  and see no defects  Considering everything  therefore  I hope  foolish as our engagement was  foolish as it has since in every way been proved  it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly That was exactly like Robert 
And that 
might perhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between them first began  And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour  Other designs might afterward arise 
    Elinor read and returned it without any comment    said Edward  
  said Elinor  after a pause —
  In what state the affair stood at present between them  Edward knew not  for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him  He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy s letter arrived  and with only one object before him  the nearest road to Barton  had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct  with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection  He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking that fate  it is to be supposed  in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon  in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts  and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts  he did not  upon the whole  expect a very cruel reception  It was his business  however  to say that he did  and he said it very prettily  What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after  must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives   That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive  to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas  was perfectly clear to Elinor; and Edward himself  now thoroughly enlightened on her character  had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill-nature  Though his eyes had been long opened  even before his acquaintance with Elinor began  to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions  they had been equally imputed  by him  to her want of education; and till her last letter reached him  he had always believed her to be a well-disposed  good-hearted girl  and thoroughly attached to himself  Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement  which  long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother s anger  had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him    said he  
  Edward was  of course  immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy s conduct  nor more self-evident than the motive of it   Elinor scolded him  harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves  for having spent so much time with them at Norland  when he must have felt his own inconstancy    said she; 
 He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart  and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement    Elinor smiled  and shook her head   Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon s being expected at the Cottage  as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him  but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford— said he  
 Now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place  But so little interest had he taken in the matter  that he owed all his knowledge of the house  garden  and glebe  extent of the parish  condition of the land  and rate of the tithes  to Elinor herself  who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon  and heard it with so much attention  as to be entirely mistress of the subject   One question after this only remained undecided  between them  one difficulty only was to be overcome  They were brought together by mutual affection  with the warmest approbation of their real friends; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain—and they only wanted something to live upon  Edward had two thousand pounds  and Elinor one  which  with Delaford living  was all that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs  Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life   Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him; and on that he rested for the residue of their income  But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton  and his choosing herself had been spoken of in Mrs  Ferrars s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his choosing Lucy Steele  she feared that Robert s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny   About four days after Edward s arrival Colonel Brandon appeared  to complete Mrs  Dashwood s satisfaction  and to give her the dignity of having  for the first time since her living at Barton  more company [332] with her than her house would hold  Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer  and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned in the morning  early enough to interrupt the lovers  first tête-à-tête before breakfast   A three weeks  residence at Delaford  where  in his evening hours at least  he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six and seventeen  brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne s looks  all the kindness of her welcome  and all the encouragement of her mother s language  to make it cheerful  Among such friends  however  and such flattery  he did revive  No rumour of Lucy s marriage had yet reached him:—he knew nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering  Every thing was explained to him by Mrs  Dashwood  and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr  Ferrars  since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor   It would be needless to say  that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other  as they advanced in each other s acquaintance  for it could not be otherwise  Their resemblance in good principles and good sense  in disposition and manner of thinking  would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship  without any other attraction; but their being in love with two sisters  and two sisters fond of each other  made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate  which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment   The letters from town  which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor s body thrill with transport  now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth  Mrs  Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale  to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl  and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr  Edward  who  she was sure  had quite doted upon the worthless hussy  and was now  by all accounts  almost broken-hearted  at Oxford   she continued  
 Mr  Dashwood s strains were more solemn  Mrs  Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women—poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility—and he considered the existence of each  under such a blow  with grateful wonder  Robert s offence was unpardonable  but Lucy s was infinitely worse  Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs  Ferrars; and even  if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son  his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter  nor be permitted to appear in her presence  The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them  was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime  because  had any suspicion of it occurred to the others  proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled  than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family  He thus continued:—   This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward  It determined him to attempt [334] a reconciliation  though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister    repeated he; 
  said Elinor  
 He agreed that he might    He had nothing to urge against it  but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission; and therefore  to make it easier to him  as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper  it was resolved that  instead of writing to Fanny  he should go to London  and personally entreat her good offices in his favour   said Marianne  in her new character of candour  
 After a visit on Colonel Brandon s side of only three or four days  the two gentlemen quitted Barton together  They were to go immediately to Delaford  that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home  and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it; and from thence  after staying there a couple of nights  he was to proceed on his journey to town   [335] CHAPTER L  After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs  Ferrars  just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring  the reproach of being too amiable  Edward was admitted to her presence  and pronounced to be again her son   Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating  For many years of her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago  had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now  by the resuscitation of Edward  she had one again   In spite of his being allowed once more to live  however  he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure  till he had revealed his present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance  he feared  might give a sudden turn to his constitution  and carry him off as rapidly as before  With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed  and he was listened to with unexpected calmness  Mrs  Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood  by every argument in her power; told him  that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune; and enforced the assertion  by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds  while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three; but when she found that  though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation  he was by no means inclined to be guided by it  she judged it wisest  from the experience of the past  to submit; and therefore  after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity  and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will  she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor   What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered; and here it plainly appeared  that though Edward was now her only son  he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was inevitably endowed [336] with a thousand pounds a-year  not the smallest objection was made against Edward s taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future  beyond the ten thousand pounds  which had been given with Fanny   It was as much  however  as was desired  and more than was expected  by Edward and Elinor; and Mrs  Ferrars herself  by her shuffling excuses  seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more   With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them  they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living  but the readiness of the house  to which Colonel Brandon  with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor  was making considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their completion  after experiencing  as usual  a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen  Elinor  as usual  broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready  and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn   The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage  and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;—could choose papers  project shrubberies  and invent a sweep  Mrs  Jennings s prophecies  though rather jumbled together  were chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas  and she found in Elinor and her husband  as she really believed  one of the happiest couples in the world  They had in fact nothing to wish for  but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne  and rather better pasturage for their cows   They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends  Mrs  Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour    said John  as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House  
 But though Mrs  Ferrars did come to see them  and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection  they were never insulted by her real favour and preference  That was due to the folly of Robert  and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away  The selfish sagacity of the latter  which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape  was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful humility  assiduous attentions  and endless flatteries  as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise  reconciled Mrs  Ferrars to his choice  and re-established him completely in her favour   [338]  
 The whole of Lucy s behaviour in the affair  and the prosperity which crowned it  therefore  may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest  an unceasing attention to self-interest  however its progress may be apparently obstructed  will do in securing every advantage of fortune  with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience  When Robert first sought her acquaintance  and privately visited her in Bartlett s Buildings  it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother  He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both  he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter  In that point  however  and that only  he erred; for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in time  another visit  another conversation  was always wanted to produce this conviction  Some doubts always lingered [339] in her mind when they parted  which could only be removed by another half hour s discourse with himself  His attendance was by this means secured  and the rest followed in course  Instead of talking of Edward  they came gradually to talk only of Robert —a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other  and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short  it became speedily evident to both  that he had entirely supplanted his brother  He was proud of his conquest  proud of tricking Edward  and very proud of marrying privately without his mother s consent  What immediately followed is known  They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut—and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages; and from thence returning to town  procured the forgiveness of Mrs  Ferrars  by the simple expedient of asking it  which  at Lucy s instigation  was adopted  The forgiveness  at first  indeed  as was reasonable  comprehended only Robert; and Lucy  who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none  still remained some weeks longer unpardoned  But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages  in self-condemnation for Robert s offence  and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with  procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness  and led soon afterwards  by rapid degrees  to the highest state of affection and influence  Lucy became as necessary to Mrs  Ferrars  as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her  and Elinor  though superior to her in fortune and birth  was spoken of as an intruder  she was in every thing considered  and always openly acknowledged  to be a favourite child  They settled in town  received very liberal assistance from Mrs  Ferrars  were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy  in which their husbands of course took a part  as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves  nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together   What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son  might have puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to it  might have puzzled them still [340] more  It was an arrangement  however  justified in its effects  if not in its cause; for nothing ever appeared in Robert s style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income  as either leaving his brother too little  or bringing himself too much;—and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular  from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home  and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits  he might be supposed no less contented with his lot  no less free from every wish of an exchange   Elinor s marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived  without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless  for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her  Mrs  Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest  though rather more liberal than what John had expressed  It was now her darling object  Precious as was the company of her daughter to her  she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor  They each felt his sorrows  and their own obligations  and Marianne  by general consent  was to be the reward of all   With such a confederacy against her—with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness—with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself  which at last  though long after it was observable to everybody else—burst on her—what could she do   Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate  She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions  and to counteract  by her conduct  her most favourite maxims  She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen  and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship  voluntarily to give her hand to another!—and that other  a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment  whom  two years before  she had considered too old to be married —and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!  But so it was  Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion  as once she had fondly [341] flattered herself with expecting  instead of remaining even for ever with her mother  and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study  as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on —she found herself at nineteen  submitting to new attachments  entering on new duties  placed in a new home  a wife  the mistress of a family  and the patroness of a village   Colonel Brandon was now as happy  as all those who best loved him  believed he deserved to be;—in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;—her regard and her society restored his mind to animation  and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his  was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend  Marianne could never love by halves; and her whole heart became  in time  as much devoted to her husband  as it had once been to Willoughby   Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs  Smith  who  by stating his marriage with a woman of character  as the source of her clemency  gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne  he might at once have been happy and rich  That his repentance of misconduct  which thus brought its own punishment  was sincere  need not be doubted;—nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy  and of Marianne with regret  But that he was for ever inconsolable  that he fled from society  or contracted an habitual gloom of temper  or died of a broken heart  must not be depended on—for he did neither  He lived to exert  and frequently to enjoy himself  His wife was not always out of humour  nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs  and in sporting of every kind  he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity   For Marianne  however  in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss  he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her  and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs  Brandon   Mrs  Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage  without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs  Jennings  when Marianne was taken from them  Margaret [342] had reached an age highly suitable for dancing  and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover   Between Barton and Delaford  there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate;—and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne  let it not be ranked as the least considerable  that though sisters  and living almost within sight of each other  they could live without disagreement between themselves  or producing coolness between their husbands   
_BOOKEND_
No  my freind never will I comply with your request till I may be no longer in Danger of again experiencing such dreadful ones 
Beware my Laura  she would often say  Beware of the insipid Vanities and idle Dissipations of the Metropolis of England; Beware of the unmeaning Luxuries of Bath and of the stinking fish of Southampton 
Alas!  exclaimed I  how am I to avoid those evils I shall never be exposed to  What probability is there of my ever tasting the Dissipations of London  the Luxuries of Bath  or the stinking Fish of Southampton  I who am doomed to waste my Days of Youth and Beauty in an humble Cottage in the Vale of Uske 
What noise is that 
It sounds like a loud rapping at the door
it does indeed 
I am of your opinion;  said my Father  it certainly does appear to proceed from some uncommon violence exerted against our unoffending door 
Yes  exclaimed I  I cannot help thinking it must be somebody who knocks for admittance 
That is another point  replied he;  We must not pretend to determine on what motive the person may knock—tho  that someone DOES rap at the door  I am partly convinced 
Had we better not go and see who it is   said she  the servants are out 
I think we had 
Certainly   added my Father  by all means 
Shall we go now 
The sooner the better 
Oh! let no time be lost
I am certain there is somebody knocking at the Door 
I think there must 
I fancy the servants are returned;  said I  I think I hear Mary going to the Door 
I m glad of it  cried my Father  for I long to know who it is 
Won t you admit them 
You have no objection  my Dear 
None in the World 
My Father  he continued  is a mean and mercenary wretch—it is only to such particular freinds as this Dear Party that I would thus betray his failings  Your Virtues my amiable Polydore  addressing himself to my father  yours Dear Claudia and yours my Charming Laura call on me to repose in you  my confidence 
My Father seduced by the false glare of Fortune and the Deluding Pomp of Title  insisted on my giving my hand to Lady Dorothea  No never exclaimed I  Lady Dorothea is lovely and Engaging; I prefer no woman to her; but know Sir  that I scorn to marry her in compliance with your Wishes  No! Never shall it be said that I obliged my Father 
Sir Edward was surprised; he had perhaps little expected to meet with so spirited an opposition to his will  
 I scorned to answer: it would have been beneath my dignity  I mounted my Horse and followed by my faithful William set forth for my Aunts 
My Father s house is situated in Bedfordshire  my Aunt s in Middlesex  and tho  I flatter myself with being a tolerable proficient in Geography  I know not how it happened  but I found myself entering this beautifull Vale which I find is in South Wales  when I had expected to have reached my Aunts 
After having wandered some time on the Banks of the Uske without knowing which way to go  I began to lament my cruel Destiny in the bitterest and most pathetic Manner  It was now perfectly dark  not a single star was there to direct my steps  and I know not what might have befallen me had I not at length discerned thro  the solemn Gloom that surrounded me a distant light  which as I approached it  I discovered to be the chearfull Blaze of your fire  Impelled by the combination of Misfortunes under which I laboured  namely Fear  Cold and Hunger I hesitated not to ask admittance which at length I have gained; and now my Adorable Laura  continued he taking my Hand  when may I hope to receive that reward of all the painfull sufferings I have undergone during the course of my attachment to you  to which I have ever aspired  Oh! when will you reward me with Yourself 
This instant  Dear and Amiable Edward 
But do you think that my Father will ever be reconciled to this imprudent connection 
Augusta  replied the noble Youth  I thought you had a better opinion of me  than to imagine I would so abjectly degrade myself as to consider my Father s Concurrence in any of my affairs  either of Consequence or concern to me  Tell me Augusta with sincerity; did you ever know me consult his inclinations or follow his Advice in the least trifling Particular since the age of fifteen 
Edward  replied she  you are surely too diffident in your own praise  Since you were fifteen only! My Dear Brother since you were five years old  I entirely acquit you of ever having willingly contributed to the satisfaction of your Father  But still I am not without apprehensions of your being shortly obliged to degrade yourself in your own eyes by seeking a support for your wife in the Generosity of Sir Edward 
Never  never Augusta will I so demean myself   said Edward   Support! What support will Laura want which she can receive from him 
Only those very insignificant ones of Victuals and Drink 
Victuals and Drink!  replied my Husband in a most nobly contemptuous Manner  and dost thou then imagine that there is no other support for an exalted mind  such as is my Laura s  than the mean and indelicate employment of Eating and Drinking 
None that I know of  so efficacious 
And did you then never feel the pleasing Pangs of Love  Augusta   replied my Edward   Does it appear impossible to your vile and corrupted Palate  to exist on Love  Can you not conceive the Luxury of living in every distress that Poverty can inflict  with the object of your tenderest affection 
You are too ridiculous  said Augusta  to argue with; perhaps however you may in time be convinced that   
Lady Dorothea 
Sir Edward  I know the motive of your Journey here—You come with the base Design of reproaching me for having entered into an indissoluble engagement with my Laura without your Consent  But Sir  I glory in the Act—  It is my greatest boast that I have incurred the displeasure of my Father!
My Life! my Soul!
My adorable angel!
Sir Edward is greatly incensed by your abrupt departure; he has taken back Augusta to Bedfordshire  Much as I wish to enjoy again your charming society  I cannot determine to snatch you from that  of such dear and deserving Freinds—When your Visit to them is terminated  I trust you will return to the arms of your
Philippa 
If they had seen my Edward 
Where am I to drive 
To Newgate Gentle Youth  replied I   to see Augustus 
Oh! no  no   exclaimed Sophia  I cannot go to Newgate; I shall not be able to support the sight of my Augustus in so cruel a confinement—my feelings are sufficiently shocked by the RECITAL  of his Distress  but to behold it will overpower my Sensibility 
I have a Relation in Scotland  said Sophia to me as we left London  who I am certain would not hesitate in receiving me 
Shall I order the Boy to drive there 
Alas I fear it will be too long a Journey for the Horses 
Acknowledge thee! Yes dear resemblance of my Laurina and Laurina s Daughter  sweet image of my Claudia and my Claudia s Mother  I do acknowledge thee as the Daughter of the one and the Grandaughter of the other 
Another Grandaughter! Yes  yes  I see you are the Daughter of my Laurina s eldest Girl; your resemblance to the beauteous Matilda sufficiently proclaims it  
 replied Sophia  
 He folded her in his arms  and whilst they were tenderly embracing  the Door of the Apartment opened and a most beautifull young Man appeared  On perceiving him Lord St  Clair started and retreating back a few paces  with uplifted Hands  said  
  
 
 
     LETTER the 12th LAURA in continuation  You may imagine how greatly we were surprised by the sudden departure of Lord St Clair   exclaimed Sophia  
 said I  and instantly fainted in each other s arms  How long we remained in this situation I know not; but when we recovered we found ourselves alone  without either Gustavus  Philander  or the Banknotes  As we were deploring our unhappy fate  the Door of the Apartment opened and 
  said Janetta  
 
 Indeed my Love  said I  you must be mistaken—for it is absolutely impossible that he should ever have left you but with Confusion  Despair  and Precipitation  Consider but for a moment Janetta  and you must be convinced how absurd it is to suppose that he could ever make a Bow  or behave like any other Person 
Oh! happy Lover of the beautifull Janetta  oh! amiable Possessor of HER Heart whose hand is destined to another  why do you thus delay a confession of your attachment to the amiable Object of it  Oh! consider that a few weeks will at once put an end to every flattering Hope that you may now entertain  by uniting the unfortunate Victim of her father s Cruelty to the execrable and detested Graham 
Alas! why do you thus so cruelly connive at the projected Misery of her and of yourself by delaying to communicate that scheme which had doubtless long possessed your imagination  A secret Union will at once secure the felicity of both 
Wherefore her retirement was thus insolently broken in on 
Wretch  exclaimed she  hastily replacing the Bank-note in the Drawer  how darest thou to accuse me of an Act  of which the bare idea makes me blush 
Base Miscreant!  cried I  how canst thou thus undauntedly endeavour to sully the spotless reputation of such bright Excellence  Why dost thou not suspect MY innocence as soon 
Be satisfied Madam  replied he  I DO suspect it  and therefore must desire that you will both leave this House in less than half an hour 
We shall go willingly;  answered Sophia  our hearts have long detested thee  and nothing but our freindship for thy Daughter could have induced us to remain so long beneath thy roof 
Your Freindship for my Daughter has indeed been most powerfully exerted by throwing her into the arms of an unprincipled Fortune-hunter 
Yes   exclaimed I  amidst every misfortune  it will afford us some consolation to reflect that by this one act of Freindship to Janetta  we have amply discharged every obligation that we have received from her father 
It must indeed be a most gratefull reflection  to your exalted minds 
What a lovely scene! Alas why are not Edward and Augustus here to enjoy its Beauties with us 
Ah! my beloved Laura  cried Sophia  for pity s sake forbear recalling to my remembrance the unhappy situation of my imprisoned Husband  Alas  what would I not give to learn the fate of my Augustus! to know if he is still in Newgate  or if he is yet hung  But never shall I be able so far to conquer my tender sensibility as to enquire after him  Oh! do not I beseech you ever let me again hear you repeat his beloved name—  It affects me too deeply—  I cannot bear to hear him mentioned it wounds my feelings 
Excuse me my Sophia for having thus unwillingly offended you—
Alas! my Laura  returned she  avoid so melancholy a subject  I intreat you  Do not again wound my Sensibility by observations on those elms  They remind me of Augustus  He was like them  tall  magestic—he possessed that noble grandeur which you admire in them 
Why do you not speak my Laura   said she after a short pause  
   From this Dilemma I was most fortunately releived by an accident truly apropos; it was the lucky overturning of a Gentleman s Phaeton  on the road which ran murmuring behind us  It was a most fortunate accident as it diverted the attention of Sophia from the melancholy reflections which she had been before indulging  We instantly quitted our seats and ran to the rescue of those who but a few moments before had been in so elevated a situation as a fashionably high Phaeton  but who were now laid low and sprawling in the Dust   She had not time to answer me  for every thought was now engaged by the horrid spectacle before us  Two Gentlemen most elegantly attired but weltering in their blood was what first struck our Eyes—we approached—they were Edward and Augustus—  Yes dearest Marianne they were our Husbands  Sophia shreiked and fainted on the ground—I screamed and instantly ran mad—  We remained thus mutually deprived of our senses  some minutes  and on regaining them were deprived of them again  For an Hour and a Quarter did we continue in this unfortunate situation—Sophia fainting every moment and I running mad as often  At length a groan from the hapless Edward  who alone retained any share of life  restored us to ourselves  Had we indeed before imagined that either of them lived  we should have been more sparing of our Greif—but as we had supposed when we first beheld them that they were no more  we knew that nothing could remain to be done but what we were about  No sooner did we therefore hear my Edward s groan than postponing our lamentations for the present  we hastily ran to the Dear Youth and kneeling on each side of him implored him not to die—   I was overjoyed to find him yet sensible      Thus I continued wildly exclaiming on my Edward s Death—  For two Hours did I rave thus madly and should not then have left off  as I was not in the least fatigued  had not Sophia who was just recovered from her swoon  intreated me to consider that Night was now approaching and that the Damps began to fall  
 
     LETTER the 14th LAURA in continuation  Arm yourself my amiable young Freind with all the philosophy you are Mistress of; summon up all the fortitude you possess  for alas! in the perusal of the following Pages your sensibility will be most severely tried  Ah! what were the misfortunes I had before experienced and which I have already related to you  to the one I am now going to inform you of  The Death of my Father and my Mother and my Husband though almost more than my gentle Nature could support  were trifles in comparison to the misfortune I am now proceeding to relate  The morning after our arrival at the Cottage  Sophia complained of a violent pain in her delicate limbs  accompanied with a disagreable Head-ake She attributed it to a cold caught by her continued faintings in the open air as the Dew was falling the Evening before  This I feared was but too probably the case; since how could it be otherwise accounted for that I should have escaped the same indisposition  but by supposing that the bodily Exertions I had undergone in my repeated fits of frenzy had so effectually circulated and warmed my Blood as to make me proof against the chilling Damps of Night  whereas  Sophia lying totally inactive on the ground must have been exposed to all their severity  I was most seriously alarmed by her illness which trifling as it may appear to you  a certain instinctive sensibility whispered me  would in the End be fatal to her   Alas! my fears were but too fully justified; she grew gradually worse—and I daily became more alarmed for her  At length she was obliged to confine herself solely to the Bed allotted us by our worthy Landlady—  Her disorder turned to a galloping Consumption and in a few days carried her off  Amidst all my Lamentations for her  and violent you may suppose they were  I yet received some consolation in the reflection of my having paid every attention to her  that could be offered  in her illness  I had wept over her every Day—had bathed her sweet face with my tears and had pressed her fair Hands continually in mine—   These were the last words she ever addressed to me   It was her dieing Advice to her afflicted Laura  who has ever most faithfully adhered to it   After having attended my lamented freind to her Early Grave  I immediately  tho  late at night  left the detested Village in which she died  and near which had expired my Husband and Augustus  I had not walked many yards from it before I was overtaken by a stage-coach  in which I instantly took a place  determined to proceed in it to Edinburgh  where I hoped to find some kind some pitying Freind who would receive and comfort me in my afflictions   It was so dark when I entered the Coach that I could not distinguish the Number of my Fellow-travellers; I could only perceive that they were many  Regardless however of anything concerning them  I gave myself up to my own sad Reflections  A general silence prevailed—A silence  which was by nothing interrupted but by the loud and repeated snores of one of the Party    At length  returning Day enabled me to behold the unprincipled Scoundrel who had so violently disturbed my feelings  It was Sir Edward the father of my Deceased Husband  By his side sate Augusta  and on the same seat with me were your Mother and Lady Dorothea  Imagine my surprise at finding myself thus seated amongst my old Acquaintance  Great as was my astonishment  it was yet increased  when on looking out of Windows  I beheld the Husband of Philippa  with Philippa by his side  on the Coachbox and when on looking behind I beheld  Philander and Gustavus in the Basket   These words roused the rest of the Party  and every eye was directed to the corner in which I sat  
  
 Although I had always despised her from the Day I had overheard her conversation with my Edward  yet in civility I complied with hers and Sir Edward s intreaties that I would inform them of the whole melancholy affair  They were greatly shocked—even the obdurate Heart of Sir Edward and the insensible one of Augusta  were touched with sorrow  by the unhappy tale  At the request of your Mother I related to them every other misfortune which had befallen me since we parted  Of the imprisonment of Augustus and the absence of Edward—of our arrival in Scotland—of our unexpected Meeting with our Grand-father and our cousins—of our visit to Macdonald-Hall—of the singular service we there performed towards Janetta—of her Fathers ingratitude for it   of his inhuman Behaviour  unaccountable suspicions  and barbarous treatment of us  in obliging us to leave the House   of our lamentations on the loss of Edward and Augustus and finally of the melancholy Death of my beloved Companion   Pity and surprise were strongly depictured in your Mother s countenance  during the whole of my narration  but I am sorry to say  that to the eternal reproach of her sensibility  the latter infinitely predominated  Nay  faultless as my conduct had certainly been during the whole course of my late misfortunes and adventures  she pretended to find fault with my behaviour in many of the situations in which I had been placed  As I was sensible myself  that I had always behaved in a manner which reflected Honour on my Feelings and Refinement  I paid little attention to what she said  and desired her to satisfy my Curiosity by informing me how she came there  instead of wounding my spotless reputation with unjustifiable Reproaches  As soon as she had complyed with my wishes in this particular and had given me an accurate detail of every thing that had befallen her since our separation  the particulars of which if you are not already acquainted with  your Mother will give you  I applied to Augusta for the same information respecting herself  Sir Edward and Lady Dorothea   She told me that having a considerable taste for the Beauties of Nature  her curiosity to behold the delightful scenes it exhibited in that part of the World had been so much raised by Gilpin s Tour to the Highlands  that she had prevailed on her Father to undertake a Tour to Scotland and had persuaded Lady Dorothea to accompany them  That they had arrived at Edinburgh a few Days before and from thence had made daily Excursions into the Country around in the Stage Coach they were then in  from one of which Excursions they were at that time returning  My next enquiries were concerning Philippa and her Husband  the latter of whom I learned having spent all her fortune  had recourse for subsistence to the talent in which  he had always most excelled  namely  Driving  and that having sold every thing which belonged to them except their Coach  had converted it into a Stage and in order to be removed from any of his former Acquaintance  had driven it to Edinburgh from whence he went to Sterling every other Day  That Philippa still retaining her affection for her ungratefull Husband  had followed him to Scotland and generally accompanied him in his little Excursions to Sterling       LETTER the 15th LAURA in continuation   When we arrived at the town where we were to Breakfast  I was determined to speak with Philander and Gustavus  and to that purpose as soon as I left the Carriage  I went to the Basket and tenderly enquired after their Health  expressing my fears of the uneasiness of their situation  At first they seemed rather confused at my appearance dreading no doubt that I might call them to account for the money which our Grandfather had left me and which they had unjustly deprived me of  but finding that I mentioned nothing of the Matter  they desired me to step into the Basket as we might there converse with greater ease  Accordingly I entered and whilst the rest of the party were devouring green tea and buttered toast  we feasted ourselves in a more refined and sentimental Manner by a confidential Conversation  I informed them of every thing which had befallen me during the course of my life  and at my request they related to me every incident of theirs    I thanked the amiable Youth for his entertaining narration  and after expressing my wishes for their Welfare and Happiness  left them in their little Habitation and returned to my other Freinds who impatiently expected me   My adventures are now drawing to a close my dearest Marianne; at least for the present   When we arrived at Edinburgh Sir Edward told me that as the Widow of his son  he desired I would accept from his Hands of four Hundred a year  I graciously promised that I would  but could not help observing that the unsimpathetic Baronet offered it more on account of my being the Widow of Edward than in being the refined and amiable Laura   I took up my Residence in a Romantic Village in the Highlands of Scotland where I have ever since continued  and where I can uninterrupted by unmeaning Visits  indulge in a melancholy solitude  my unceasing Lamentations for the Death of my Father  my Mother  my Husband and my Freind   Augusta has been for several years united to Graham the Man of all others most suited to her;

yet fear that from me  it will always remain so; that as far as it is carried  it should be so trifling and so unworthy of you  is another concern to your obliged humble Servant  The Author  Messrs Demand and Co—please to pay Jane Austen Spinster the sum of one hundred guineas on account of your Humble Servant   H  T  Austen  L105  0  0       LESLEY CASTLE      LETTER the FIRST is from Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE  LUTTERELL  Lesley Castle Janry 3rd—1792   My Brother has just left us       LETTER the SECOND From Miss C  LUTTERELL to Miss M  LESLEY in answer   Glenford Febry 12  I have a thousand excuses to beg for having so long delayed thanking you my dear Peggy for your agreable Letter  which beleive me I should not have deferred doing  had not every moment of my time during the last five weeks been so fully employed in the necessary arrangements for my sisters wedding  as to allow me no time to devote either to you or myself  And now what provokes me more than anything else is that the Match is broke off  and all my Labour thrown away  Imagine how great the Dissapointment must be to me  when you consider that after having laboured both by Night and by Day  in order to get the Wedding dinner ready by the time appointed  after having roasted Beef  Broiled Mutton  and Stewed Soup enough to last the new-married Couple through the Honey-moon  I had the mortification of finding that I had been Roasting  Broiling and Stewing both the Meat and Myself to no purpose  Indeed my dear Freind  I never remember suffering any vexation equal to what I experienced on last Monday when my sister came running to me in the store-room with her face as White as a Whipt syllabub  and told me that Hervey had been thrown from his Horse  had fractured his Scull and was pronounced by his surgeon to be in the most emminent Danger   Here I was interrupted  by seeing my poor Sister fall down to appearance Lifeless upon one of the Chests  where we keep our Table linen  I immediately called my Mother and the Maids  and at last we brought her to herself again; as soon as ever she was sensible  she expressed a determination of going instantly to Henry  and was so wildly bent on this Scheme  that we had the greatest Difficulty in the World to prevent her putting it in execution; at last however more by Force than Entreaty we prevailed on her to go into her room; we laid her upon the Bed  and she continued for some Hours in the most dreadful Convulsions  My Mother and I continued in the room with her  and when any intervals of tolerable Composure in Eloisa would allow us  we joined in heartfelt lamentations on the dreadful Waste in our provisions which this Event must occasion  and in concerting some plan for getting rid of them  We agreed that the best thing we could do was to begin eating them immediately  and accordingly we ordered up the cold Ham and Fowls  and instantly began our Devouring Plan on them with great Alacrity  We would have persuaded Eloisa to have taken a Wing of a Chicken  but she would not be persuaded  She was however much quieter than she had been; the convulsions she had before suffered having given way to an almost perfect Insensibility  We endeavoured to rouse her by every means in our power  but to no purpose  I talked to her of Henry  
 P  S  I have this instant received an answer from my freind Susan  which I enclose to you  and on which you will make your own reflections   The enclosed LETTER  My dear CHARLOTTE You could not have applied for information concerning the report of Sir George Lesleys Marriage  to any one better able to give it you than I am  Sir George is certainly married; I was myself present at the Ceremony  which you will not be surprised at when I subscribe myself your Affectionate Susan Lesley      LETTER the THIRD From Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss C  LUTTERELL Lesley  Castle February the 16th  I have made my own reflections on the letter you enclosed to me  my Dear Charlotte and I will now tell you what those reflections were  I reflected that if by this second Marriage Sir George should have a second family  our fortunes must be considerably diminushed—that if his Wife should be of an extravagant turn  she would encourage him to persevere in that gay and Dissipated way of Life to which little encouragement would be necessary  and which has I fear already proved but too detrimental to his health and fortune—that she would now become Mistress of those Jewels which once adorned our Mother  and which Sir George had always promised us—that if they did not come into Perthshire I should not be able to gratify my curiosity of beholding my Mother-in-law and that if they did  Matilda would no longer sit at the head of her Father s table—  These my dear Charlotte were the melancholy reflections which crowded into my imagination after perusing Susan s letter to you  and which instantly occurred to Matilda when she had perused it likewise  The same ideas  the same fears  immediately occupied her Mind  and I know not which reflection distressed her most  whether the probable Diminution of our Fortunes  or her own Consequence  We both wish very much to know whether Lady Lesley is handsome and what is your opinion of her; as you honour her with the appellation of your freind  we flatter ourselves that she must be amiable  My Brother is already in Paris  He intends to quit it in a few Days  and to begin his route to Italy  He writes in a most chearfull manner  says that the air of France has greatly recovered both his Health and Spirits; that he has now entirely ceased to think of Louisa with any degree either of Pity or Affection  that he even feels himself obliged to her for her Elopement  as he thinks it very good fun to be single again  By this  you may perceive that he has entirely regained that chearful Gaiety  and sprightly Wit  for which he was once so remarkable  When he first became acquainted with Louisa which was little more than three years ago  he was one of the most lively  the most agreable young Men of the age—  I beleive you never yet heard the particulars of his first acquaintance with her  It commenced at our cousin Colonel Drummond s; at whose house in Cumberland he spent the Christmas  in which he attained the age of two and twenty  Louisa Burton was the Daughter of a distant Relation of Mrs  Drummond  who dieing a few Months before in extreme poverty  left his only Child then about eighteen to the protection of any of his Relations who would protect her  Mrs  Drummond was the only one who found herself so disposed—Louisa was therefore removed from a miserable Cottage in Yorkshire to an elegant Mansion in Cumberland  and from every pecuniary Distress that Poverty could inflict  to every elegant Enjoyment that Money could purchase—  Louisa was naturally ill-tempered and Cunning; but she had been taught to disguise her real Disposition  under the appearance of insinuating Sweetness  by a father who but too well knew  that to be married  would be the only chance she would have of not being starved  and who flattered himself that with such an extroidinary share of personal beauty  joined to a gentleness of Manners  and an engaging address  she might stand a good chance of pleasing some young Man who might afford to marry a girl without a Shilling  Louisa perfectly entered into her father s schemes and was determined to forward them with all her care and attention  By dint of Perseverance and Application  she had at length so thoroughly disguised her natural disposition under the mask of Innocence  and Softness  as to impose upon every one who had not by a long and constant intimacy with her discovered her real Character  Such was Louisa when the hapless Lesley first beheld her at Drummond-house  His heart which  to use your favourite comparison  was as delicate as sweet and as tender as a Whipt-syllabub  could not resist her attractions  In a very few Days  he was falling in love  shortly after actually fell  and before he had known her a Month  he had married her  My Father was at first highly displeased at so hasty and imprudent a connection; but when he found that they did not mind it  he soon became perfectly reconciled to the match  The Estate near Aberdeen which my brother possesses by the bounty of his great Uncle independant of Sir George  was entirely sufficient to support him and my Sister in Elegance and Ease  For the first twelvemonth  no one could be happier than Lesley  and no one more amiable to appearance than Louisa  and so plausibly did she act and so cautiously behave that tho  Matilda and I often spent several weeks together with them  yet we neither of us had any suspicion of her real Disposition  After the birth of Louisa however  which one would have thought would have strengthened her regard for Lesley  the mask she had so long supported was by degrees thrown aside  and as probably she then thought herself secure in the affection of her Husband  which did indeed appear if possible augmented by the birth of his Child  she seemed to take no pains to prevent that affection from ever diminushing  Our visits therefore to Dunbeath  were now less frequent and by far less agreable than they used to be  Our absence was however never either mentioned or lamented by Louisa who in the society of young Danvers with whom she became acquainted at Aberdeen  he was at one of the Universities there   felt infinitely happier than in that of Matilda and your freind  tho  there certainly never were pleasanter girls than we are  You know the sad end of all Lesleys connubial happiness; I will not repeat it—  Adeiu my dear Charlotte; although I have not yet mentioned anything of the matter  I hope you will do me the justice to beleive that I THINK and FEEL  a great deal for your Sisters affliction  I do not doubt but that the healthy air of the Bristol downs will intirely remove it  by erasing from her Mind the remembrance of Henry  I am my dear Charlotte yrs ever M  L       LETTER the FOURTH From Miss C  LUTTERELL to Miss M  LESLEY Bristol  February 27th  My Dear Peggy I have but just received your letter  which being directed to Sussex while I was at Bristol was obliged to be forwarded to me here  and from some unaccountable Delay  has but this instant reached me—  I return you many thanks for the account it contains of Lesley s acquaintance  Love and Marriage with Louisa  which has not the less entertained me for having often been repeated to me before   I have the satisfaction of informing you that we have every reason to imagine our pantry is by this time nearly cleared  as we left Particular orders with the servants to eat as hard as they possibly could  and to call in a couple of Chairwomen to assist them  We brought a cold Pigeon pye  a cold turkey  a cold tongue  and half a dozen Jellies with us  which we were lucky enough with the help of our Landlady  her husband  and their three children  to get rid of  in less than two days after our arrival  Poor Eloisa is still so very indifferent both in Health and Spirits  that I very much fear  the air of the Bristol downs  healthy as it is  has not been able to drive poor Henry from her remembrance   You ask me whether your new Mother in law is handsome and amiable—I will now give you an exact description of her bodily and mental charms  She is short  and extremely well made; is naturally pale  but rouges a good deal; has fine eyes  and fine teeth  as she will take care to let you know as soon as she sees you  and is altogether very pretty  She is remarkably good-tempered when she has her own way  and very lively when she is not out of humour  She is naturally extravagant and not very affected; she never reads anything but the letters she receives from me  and never writes anything but her answers to them  She plays  sings and Dances  but has no taste for either  and excells in none  tho  she says she is passionately fond of all  Perhaps you may flatter me so far as to be surprised that one of whom I speak with so little affection should be my particular freind; but to tell you the truth  our freindship arose rather from Caprice on her side than Esteem on mine  We spent two or three days together with a Lady in Berkshire with whom we both happened to be connected—  During our visit  the Weather being remarkably bad  and our party particularly stupid  she was so good as to conceive a violent partiality for me  which very soon settled in a downright Freindship and ended in an established correspondence  She is probably by this time as tired of me  as I am of her; but as she is too Polite and I am too civil to say so  our letters are still as frequent and affectionate as ever  and our Attachment as firm and sincere as when it first commenced  As she had a great taste for the pleasures of London  and of Brighthelmstone  she will I dare say find some difficulty in prevailing on herself even to satisfy the curiosity I dare say she feels of beholding you  at the expence of quitting those favourite haunts of Dissipation  for the melancholy tho  venerable gloom of the castle you inhabit  Perhaps however if she finds her health impaired by too much amusement  she may acquire fortitude sufficient to undertake a Journey to Scotland in the hope of its Proving at least beneficial to her health  if not conducive to her happiness  Your fears I am sorry to say  concerning your father s extravagance  your own fortunes  your Mothers Jewels and your Sister s consequence  I should suppose are but too well founded  My freind herself has four thousand pounds  and will probably spend nearly as much every year in Dress and Public places  if she can get it—she will certainly not endeavour to reclaim Sir George from the manner of living to which he has been so long accustomed  and there is therefore some reason to fear that you will be very well off  if you get any fortune at all  The Jewels I should imagine too will undoubtedly be hers  and there is too much reason to think that she will preside at her Husbands table in preference to his Daughter  But as so melancholy a subject must necessarily extremely distress you  I will no longer dwell on it—   Eloisa s indisposition has brought us to Bristol at so unfashionable a season of the year  that we have actually seen but one genteel family since we came  Mr and Mrs Marlowe are very agreable people; the ill health of their little boy occasioned their arrival here; you may imagine that being the only family with whom we can converse  we are of course on a footing of intimacy with them; we see them indeed almost every day  and dined with them yesterday  We spent a very pleasant Day  and had a very good Dinner  tho  to be sure the Veal was terribly underdone  and the Curry had no seasoning  I could not help wishing all dinner-time that I had been at the dressing it—  A brother of Mrs Marlowe  Mr Cleveland is with them at present; he is a good-looking young Man  and seems to have a good deal to say for himself  I tell Eloisa that she should set her cap at him  but she does not at all seem to relish the proposal  I should like to see the girl married and Cleveland has a very good estate  Perhaps you may wonder that I do not consider myself as well as my Sister in my matrimonial Projects; but to tell you the truth I never wish to act a more principal part at a Wedding than the superintending and directing the Dinner  and therefore while I can get any of my acquaintance to marry for me  I shall never think of doing it myself  as I very much suspect that I should not have so much time for dressing my own Wedding-dinner  as for dressing that of my freinds  Yours sincerely C  L       LETTER the FIFTH Miss MARGARET LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL  Lesley-Castle March 18th  On the same day that I received your last kind letter  Matilda received one from Sir George which was dated from Edinburgh  and informed us that he should do himself the pleasure of introducing Lady Lesley to us on the following evening  This as you may suppose considerably surprised us  particularly as your account of her Ladyship had given us reason to imagine there was little chance of her visiting Scotland at a time that London must be so gay  As it was our business however to be delighted at such a mark of condescension as a visit from Sir George and Lady Lesley  we prepared to return them an answer expressive of the happiness we enjoyed in expectation of such a Blessing  when luckily recollecting that as they were to reach the Castle the next Evening  it would be impossible for my father to receive it before he left Edinburgh  we contented ourselves with leaving them to suppose that we were as happy as we ought to be  At nine in the Evening on the following day  they came  accompanied by one of Lady Lesleys brothers  Her Ladyship perfectly answers the description you sent me of her  except that I do not think her so pretty as you seem to consider her  She has not a bad face  but there is something so extremely unmajestic in her little diminutive figure  as to render her in comparison with the elegant height of Matilda and Myself  an insignificant Dwarf  Her curiosity to see us  which must have been great to bring her more than four hundred miles  being now perfectly gratified  she already begins to mention their return to town  and has desired us to accompany her  We cannot refuse her request since it is seconded by the commands of our Father  and thirded by the entreaties of Mr  Fitzgerald who is certainly one of the most pleasing young Men  I ever beheld  It is not yet determined when we are to go  but when ever we do we shall certainly take our little Louisa with us  Adeiu my dear Charlotte; Matilda unites in best wishes to you  and Eloisa  with yours ever M  L       LETTER the SIXTH LADY LESLEY to Miss CHARLOTTE LUTTERELL Lesley-Castle  March 20th  We arrived here my sweet Freind about a fortnight ago  and I already heartily repent that I ever left our charming House in Portman-square for such a dismal old weather-beaten Castle as this  You can form no idea sufficiently hideous  of its dungeon-like form  It is actually perched upon a Rock to appearance so totally inaccessible  that I expected to have been pulled up by a rope; and sincerely repented having gratified my curiosity to behold my Daughters at the expence of being obliged to enter their prison in so dangerous and ridiculous a manner  But as soon as I once found myself safely arrived in the inside of this tremendous building  I comforted myself with the hope of having my spirits revived  by the sight of two beautifull girls  such as the Miss Lesleys had been represented to me  at Edinburgh  But here again  I met with nothing but Disappointment and Surprise  Matilda and Margaret Lesley are two great  tall  out of the way  over-grown  girls  just of a proper size to inhabit a Castle almost as large in comparison as themselves  I wish my dear Charlotte that you could but behold these Scotch giants; I am sure they would frighten you out of your wits  They will do very well as foils to myself  so I have invited them to accompany me to London where I hope to be in the course of a fortnight  Besides these two fair Damsels  I found a little humoured Brat here who I beleive is some relation to them  they told me who she was  and gave me a long rigmerole story of her father and a Miss SOMEBODY which I have entirely forgot  I hate scandal and detest Children  I have been plagued ever since I came here with tiresome visits from a parcel of Scotch wretches  with terrible hard-names; they were so civil  gave me so many invitations  and talked of coming again so soon  that I could not help affronting them  I suppose I shall not see them any more  and yet as a family party we are so stupid  that I do not know what to do with myself  These girls have no Music  but Scotch airs  no Drawings but Scotch Mountains  and no Books but Scotch Poems—and I hate everything Scotch  In general I can spend half the Day at my toilett with a great deal of pleasure  but why should I dress here  since there is not a creature in the House whom I have any wish to please  I have just had a conversation with my Brother in which he has greatly offended me  and which as I have nothing more entertaining to send you I will gave you the particulars of  You must know that I have for these 4 or 5 Days past strongly suspected William of entertaining a partiality to my eldest Daughter  I own indeed that had I been inclined to fall in love with any woman  I should not have made choice of Matilda Lesley for the object of my passion; for there is nothing I hate so much as a tall Woman: but however there is no accounting for some men s taste and as William is himself nearly six feet high  it is not wonderful that he should be partial to that height  Now as I have a very great affection for my Brother and should be extremely sorry to see him unhappy  which I suppose he means to be if he cannot marry Matilda  as moreover I know that his circumstances will not allow him to marry any one without a fortune  and that Matilda s is entirely dependant on her Father  who will neither have his own inclination nor my permission to give her anything at present  I thought it would be doing a good-natured action by my Brother to let him know as much  in order that he might choose for himself  whether to conquer his passion  or Love and Despair  Accordingly finding myself this Morning alone with him in one of the horrid old rooms of this Castle  I opened the cause to him in the following Manner                         You must not look so grave Susan; you will make me fear I have offended you!
Offended me! Dear Brother  how came such a thought in your head!  returned I  No really! I assure you that I am not in the least surprised at your being so warm an advocate for the Beauty of these girls 
Well  but  interrupted William  remember that we have not yet concluded our dispute concerning them  What fault do you find with their complexion 
They are so horridly pale 
They have always a little colour  and after any exercise it is considerably heightened 
Yes  but if there should ever happen to be any rain in this part of the world  they will never be able raise more than their common stock—except indeed they amuse themselves with running up and Down these horrid old galleries and Antichambers 
Well   replied my Brother in a tone of vexation  and glancing an impertinent look at me  if they HAVE but little colour  at least  it is all their own 
Thank you Eloisa;
Well Charlotte  I am very glad to find that you have at last left off that ridiculous custom of applauding my Execution on the Harpsichord till you made my head ake  and yourself hoarse  I feel very much obliged to you for keeping your admiration to yourself 
Eloisa  said I  I beg you would be quite at your Ease with respect to all such fears in future  for be assured that I shall always keep my admiration to myself and my own pursuits and never extend it to yours 
No  says the disagreable Woman  I have once in my life been fool enough to travel I dont know how many hundred Miles to see two of the Family  and I found it did not answer  so Deuce take me  if ever I am so foolish again 
he was come to lay his bones among them 
My dear Girls the moment is now arrived when I am to reap the rewards of all my Anxieties and Labours towards you during your Education  You are this Evening to enter a World in which you will meet with many wonderfull Things; Yet let me warn you against suffering yourselves to be meanly swayed by the Follies and Vices of others  for beleive me my beloved Children that if you do—I shall be very sorry for it 
 
 When we arrived at Warleigh  poor Augusta could scarcely breathe  while Margaret was all Life and Rapture  
     LETTER the SECOND From a YOUNG LADY crossed in Love to her freind  Why should this last disappointment hang so heavily on my spirits  Why should I feel it more  why should it wound me deeper than those I have experienced before  Can it be that I have a greater affection for Willoughby than I had for his amiable predecessors  Or is it that our feelings become more acute from being often wounded  I must suppose my dear Belle that this is the Case  since I am not conscious of being more sincerely attached to Willoughby than I was to Neville  Fitzowen  or either of the Crawfords  for all of whom I once felt the most lasting affection that ever warmed a Woman s heart  Tell me then dear Belle why I still sigh when I think of the faithless Edward  or why I weep when I behold his Bride  for too surely this is the case—  My Freinds are all alarmed for me; They fear my declining health; they lament my want of spirits; they dread the effects of both  In hopes of releiving my melancholy  by directing my thoughts to other objects  they have invited several of their freinds to spend the Christmas with us  Lady Bridget Darkwood and her sister-in-law  Miss Jane are expected on Friday; and Colonel Seaton s family will be with us next week  This is all most kindly meant by my Uncle and Cousins; but what can the presence of a dozen indefferent people do to me  but weary and distress me—  I will not finish my Letter till some of our Visitors are arrived   Friday Evening Lady Bridget came this morning  and with her  her sweet sister Miss Jane—  Although I have been acquainted with this charming Woman above fifteen Years  yet I never before observed how lovely she is  She is now about 35  and in spite of sickness  sorrow and Time is more blooming than I ever saw a Girl of 17  I was delighted with her  the moment she entered the house  and she appeared equally pleased with me  attaching herself to me during the remainder of the day  There is something so sweet  so mild in her Countenance  that she seems more than Mortal  Her Conversation is as bewitching as her appearance; I could not help telling her how much she engaged my admiration—  How do you do 
My dear Sophia be not uneasy at having exposed yourself—I will turn the Conversation without appearing to notice it  
 Do you ride as much as you used to do 
I am advised to ride by my Physician  We have delightful Rides round us  I have a Charming horse  am uncommonly fond of the Amusement  replied I quite recovered from my Confusion  and in short I ride a great deal 
You are in the right my Love 
Ride where you may  Be Candid where you can 
 I rode once  but it is many years ago—She spoke this in so low and tremulous a Voice  that I was silent—  Struck with her Manner of speaking I could make no reply  
 I was never so surprised—
 I repeated  
  But did not you own it  and assume his name at your husband s death 
No; I could not bring myself to do it; more especially when in my Children I lost all inducement for doing it  Lady Bridget  and yourself are the only persons who are in the knowledge of my having ever been either Wife or Mother  As I could not Prevail on myself to take the name of Dashwood  a name which after my Henry s death I could never hear without emotion  and as I was conscious of having no right to that of Annesley  I dropt all thoughts of either  and have made it a point of bearing only my Christian one since my Father s death 
Oh! my dear Miss Jane  said I  how infinitely am I obliged to you for so entertaining a story! You cannot think how it has diverted me! But have you quite done 
I have only to add my dear Sophia  that my Henry s elder Brother dieing about the same time  Lady Bridget became a Widow like myself  and as we had always loved each other in idea from the high Character in which we had ever been spoken of  though we had never met  we determined to live together  We wrote to one another on the same subject by the same post  so exactly did our feeling and our actions coincide! We both eagerly embraced the proposals we gave and received of becoming one family  and have from that time lived together in the greatest affection 
And is this all  said I  I hope you have not done 
Indeed I have; and did you ever hear a story more pathetic 
I never did—and it is for that reason it pleases me so much  for when one is unhappy nothing is so delightful to one s sensations as to hear of equal misery 
Ah! but my Sophia why are YOU unhappy 
Have you not heard Madam of Willoughby s Marriage 
But my love why lament HIS perfidy  when you bore so well that of many young Men before 
Ah! Madam  I was used to it then  but when Willoughby broke his Engagements I had not been dissapointed for half a year 
Poor Girl!
So Miss Maria  said her Ladyship as she saw me advancing to the door of the Carriage  you seem very smart to night—MY poor Girls will appear quite to disadvantage by YOU—I only hope your Mother may not have distressed herself to set YOU off  Have you got a new Gown on 
Yes Ma am 
Aye  and a fine one too I think— feeling it  as by her permission I seated myself by her  I dare say it is all very smart—But I must own  for you know I always speak my mind  that I think it was quite a needless piece of expence—Why could not you have worn your old striped one  It is not my way to find fault with People because they are poor  for I always think that they are more to be despised and pitied than blamed for it  especially if they cannot help it  but at the same time I must say that in my opinion your old striped Gown would have been quite fine enough for its Wearer—for to tell you the truth  I always speak my mind  I am very much afraid that one half of the people in the room will not know whether you have a Gown on or not—But I suppose you intend to make your fortune to night—  Well  the sooner the better; and I wish you success 
Indeed Ma am I have no such intention—
Who ever heard a young Lady own that she was a Fortune-hunter 
Was your Mother gone to bed before you left her 
Dear Ma am  said Ellen it is but nine o clock 
True Ellen  but Candles cost money  and Mrs Williams is too wise to be extravagant 
She was just sitting down to supper Ma am 
And what had she got for supper 
I did not observe 
Bread and Cheese I suppose 
I should never wish for a better supper 
You have never any reason replied her Mother  as a better is always provided for you 
Hey day  Miss Maria! What cannot you get a partner  Poor Young Lady! I am afraid your new Gown was put on for nothing  But do not despair; perhaps you may get a hop before the Evening is over 
Pray Miss Maria in what way of business was your Grandfather  for Miss Mason and I cannot agree whether he was a Grocer or a Bookbinder 
Neither Madam; he was a Wine Merchant 
Aye  I knew he was in some such low way—He broke did not he 
I beleive not Ma am 
Did not he abscond 
I never heard that he did 
At least he died insolvent 
I was never told so before 
Why  was not your FATHER as poor as a Rat
I fancy not 
Was not he in the Kings Bench once 
I never saw him there 
she should not get out but that Miss Maria must come to the Coach-door  as she wanted to speak to her  and that she must make haste and come immediately—
What an impertinent Message Mama!
Go Maria—
Why I think Miss Maria you are not quite so smart as you were last night—But I did not come to examine your dress  but to tell you that you may dine with us the day after tomorrow—Not tomorrow  remember  do not come tomorrow  for we expect Lord and Lady Clermont and Sir Thomas Stanley s family—There will be no occasion for your being very fine for I shant send the Carriage—If it rains you may take an umbrella—
And pray remember to be in time  for I shant wait—I hate my Victuals over-done—But you need not come before the time—How does your Mother do  She is at dinner is not she 
Yes Ma am we were in the middle of dinner when your Ladyship came 
I am afraid you find it very cold Maria 
Yes  it is an horrible East wind—said her Mother—I assure you I can hardly bear the window down—But you are used to be blown about by the wind Miss Maria and that is what has made your Complexion so rudely and coarse  You young Ladies who cannot often ride in a Carriage never mind what weather you trudge in  or how the wind shews your legs  I would not have my Girls stand out of doors as you do in such a day as this  But some sort of people have no feelings either of cold or Delicacy—Well  remember that we shall expect you on Thursday at 5 o clock—You must tell your Maid to come for you at night—There will be no Moon—and you will have an horrid walk home—My compts to Your Mother—I am afraid your dinner will be cold—Drive on—
Have you been long in Essex Ma am 
I arrived on Tuesday 
You came from Derbyshire 
No  Ma am! appearing surprised at my question  from Suffolk 
Are you pleased with the Country Miss Grenville  Do you find it equal to the one you have left 
Much superior Ma am in point of Beauty 
But the face of any Country however beautiful said I  can be but a poor consolation for the loss of one s dearest Freinds 
You regret having left Suffolk then Miss Grenville 
Indeed I do 
You were born there I suppose 
Yes Ma am I was and passed many happy years there—
That is a great comfort—said I—I hope Ma am that you never spent any unhappy one s there 
Perfect Felicity is not the property of Mortals  and no one has a right to expect uninterrupted Happiness —Some Misfortunes I have certainly met with 
WHAT Misfortunes dear Ma am  replied I  burning with impatience to know every thing  
 
 She sighed—
 
 She pronounced these words in so mournfull and solemn an accent  that for some time I had not courage to reply  I was actually silenced  I recovered myself however in a few moments and looking at her with all the affection I could  
  I bowed  but felt a good deal mortified by such a repulse; still however I had not given up my point  I found that by the appearance of sentiment and Freindship nothing was to be gained and determined therefore to renew my attacks by Questions and suppositions          LETTER the FIFTH From a YOUNG LADY very much in love to her Freind  My Uncle gets more stingy  my Aunt more particular  and I more in love every day  What shall we all be at this rate by the end of the year! I had this morning the happiness of receiving the following Letter from my dear Musgrove   Sackville St: Janry 7th It is a month to day since I first beheld my lovely Henrietta  and the sacred anniversary must and shall be kept in a manner becoming the day—by writing to her  Never shall I forget the moment when her Beauties first broke on my sight—No time as you well know can erase it from my Memory  It was at Lady Scudamores  Happy Lady Scudamore to live within a mile of the divine Henrietta! When the lovely Creature first entered the room  oh! what were my sensations  The sight of you was like the sight ofa wonderful fine Thing  I started—I gazed at her with admiration—She appeared every moment more Charming  and the unfortunate Musgrove became a captive to your Charms before I had time to look about me  Yes Madam  I had the happiness of adoring you  an happiness for which I cannot be too grateful  Why upon my word said I  I think he is a very handsome young Man 
I am glad you think so replied she  for he is distractedly in love with you 
Law! Lady Scudamore said I  how can you talk so ridiculously 
Nay  t is very true answered she  I assure you  for he was in love with you from the first moment he beheld you 
I wish it may be true said I  for that is the only kind of love I would give a farthing for—There is some sense in being in love at first sight 
Well  I give you Joy of your conquest  replied Lady Scudamore  and I beleive it to have been a very complete one; I am sure it is not a contemptible one  for my Cousin is a charming young fellow  has seen a great deal of the World  and writes the best Love-letters I ever read 
This is all very pretty Lady Scudamore  but you know that we young Ladies who are Heiresses must not throw ourselves away upon Men who have no fortune at all 
My dear Miss Halton said she  I am as much convinced of that as you can be  and I do assure you that I should be the last person to encourage your marrying anyone who had not some pretensions to expect a fortune with you  Mr Musgrove is so far from being poor that he has an estate of several hundreds an year which is capable of great Improvement  and an excellent House  though at Present it is not quite in repair 
If that is the case replied I  I have nothing more to say against him  and if as you say he is an informed young Man and can write a good Love-letter  I am sure I have no reason to find fault with him for admiring me  tho  perhaps I may not marry him for all that Lady Scudamore 
You are certainly under no obligation to marry him answered her Ladyship  except that which love himself will dictate to you  for if I am not greatly mistaken you are at this very moment unknown to yourself  cherishing a most tender affection for him 
Law  Lady Scudamore replied I blushing how can you think of such a thing 
Because every look  every word betrays it  answered she; Come my dear Henrietta  consider me as a freind  and be sincere with me—Do not you prefer Mr Musgrove to any man of your acquaintance 
Pray do not ask me such questions Lady Scudamore  said I turning away my head  for it is not fit for me to answer them 
Nay my Love replied she  now you confirm my suspicions  But why Henrietta should you be ashamed to own a well-placed Love  or why refuse to confide in me 
I am not ashamed to own it; said I taking Courage  I do not refuse to confide in you or blush to say that I do love your cousin Mr Musgrove  that I am sincerely attached to him  for it is no disgrace to love a handsome Man  If he were plain indeed I might have had reason to be ashamed of a passion which must have been mean since the object would have been unworthy  But with such a figure and face  and such beautiful hair as your Cousin has  why should I blush to own that such superior merit has made an impression on me 
My sweet Girl  said Lady Scudamore embracing me with great affection  what a delicate way of thinking you have in these matters  and what a quick discernment for one of your years! Oh! how I honour you for such Noble Sentiments!
Do you Ma am said I; You are vastly obliging  But pray Lady Scudamore did your Cousin himself tell you of his affection for me I shall like him the better if he did  for what is a Lover without a Confidante 
Oh! my Love replied she  you were born for each other  Every word you say more deeply convinces me that your Minds are actuated by the invisible power of simpathy  for your opinions and sentiments so exactly coincide  Nay  the colour of your Hair is not very different  Yes my dear Girl  the poor despairing Musgrove did reveal to me the story of his Love—  Nor was I surprised at it—I know not how it was  but I had a kind of presentiment that he would be in love with you 
Well  but how did he break it to you 
 Yes I m in love I feel it now And Henrietta Halton has undone me   —
 cried I  Lady Scudamore continued  
   
     Did you ever hear any thing so pathetic  What a charming wish  to be lain at my feet when he was dead! Oh! what an exalted mind he must have to be capable of such a wish! Lady Scudamore went on    
 
   
 
         What a noble Creature he is! Oh! Matilda what a fortunate one I am  who am to be his Wife! My Aunt is calling me to come and make the pies  so adeiu my dear freind  and beleive me yours etc—H  Halton   Finis   SCRAPS  To Miss FANNY CATHERINE AUSTEN  MY Dear Neice As I am prevented by the great distance between Rowling and Steventon from superintending your Education myself  the care of which will probably on that account devolve on your Father and Mother  I think it is my particular Duty to Prevent your feeling as much as possible the want of my personal instructions  by addressing to you on paper my Opinions and Admonitions on the conduct of Young Women  which you will find expressed in the following pages —I am my dear Neice Your affectionate Aunt The Author       THE FEMALE PHILOSOPHER A LETTER  My Dear Louisa Your friend Mr Millar called upon us yesterday in his way to Bath  whither he is going for his health; two of his daughters were with him  but the eldest and the three Boys are with their Mother in Sussex  Though you have often told me that Miss Millar was remarkably handsome  you never mentioned anything of her Sisters  beauty; yet they are certainly extremely pretty  I ll give you their description —Julia is eighteen; with a countenance in which Modesty  Sense and Dignity are happily blended  she has a form which at once presents you with Grace  Elegance and Symmetry  Charlotte who is just sixteen is shorter than her Sister  and though her figure cannot boast the easy dignity of Julia s  yet it has a pleasing plumpness which is in a different way as estimable  She is fair and her face is expressive sometimes of softness the most bewitching  and at others of Vivacity the most striking  She appears to have infinite Wit and a good humour unalterable; her conversation during the half hour they set with us  was replete with humourous sallies  Bonmots and repartees; while the sensible  the amiable Julia uttered sentiments of Morality worthy of a heart like her own  Mr Millar appeared to answer the character I had always received of him  My Father met him with that look of Love  that social Shake  and cordial kiss which marked his gladness at beholding an old and valued freind from whom thro  various circumstances he had been separated nearly twenty years  Mr Millar observed  and very justly too  that many events had befallen each during that interval of time  which gave occasion to the lovely Julia for making most sensible reflections on the many changes in their situation which so long a period had occasioned  on the advantages of some  and the disadvantages of others  From this subject she made a short digression to the instability of human pleasures and the uncertainty of their duration  which led her to observe that all earthly Joys must be imperfect  She was proceeding to illustrate this doctrine by examples from the Lives of great Men when the Carriage came to the Door and the amiable Moralist with her Father and Sister was obliged to depart; but not without a promise of spending five or six months with us on their return  We of course mentioned you  and I assure you that ample Justice was done to your Merits by all       THE FIRST ACT OF A COMEDY  CHARACTERS Popgun Maria Charles Pistolletta Postilion Hostess Chorus of ploughboys Cook and and Strephon Chloe  SCENE—AN INN  ENTER Hostess  Charles  Maria  and Cook   Hostess to Maria  If the gentry in the Lion should want beds  shew them number 9   Maria  Yes Mistress —EXIT Maria  Hostess to Cook  If their Honours in the Moon ask for the bill of fare  give it them   Cook  I wull  I wull  EXIT Cook   Hostess to Charles  If their Ladyships in the Sun ring their Bell—answerit   Charles  Yes Madam  EXEUNT Severally   SCENE CHANGES TO THE MOON  and discovers Popgun and Pistoletta   Pistoletta  Pray papa how far is it to London   Popgun  My Girl  my Darling  my favourite of all my Children  who art the picture of thy poor Mother who died two months ago  with whom I am going to Town to marry to Strephon  and to whom I mean to bequeath my whole Estate  it wants seven Miles   SCENE CHANGES TO THE SUN—  ENTER Chloe and a chorus of ploughboys   Chloe  Where am I  At Hounslow —Where go I  To London—  What to do  To be married—  Unto whom  Unto Strephon  Who is he  A Youth  Then I will sing a song   SONG I go to Town And when I come down  I shall be married to Streephon * [*Note the two e s] And that to me will be fun   Chorus  Be fun  be fun  be fun  And that to me will be fun   ENTER Cook—Cook  Here is the bill of fare   Chloe reads  2 Ducks  a leg of beef  a stinking partridge  and a tart —I will have the leg of beef and the partridge  EXIT Cook  And now I will sing another song   SONG—I am going to have my dinner  After which I shan t be thinner  I wish I had here Strephon For he would carve the partridge if it should be a tough one   Chorus  Tough one  tough one  tough one For he would carve the partridge if it Should be a tough one  EXIT Chloe and Chorus —  SCENE CHANGES TO THE INSIDE OF THE LION   Enter Strephon and Postilion  Streph:  You drove me from Staines to this place  from whence I mean to go to Town to marry Chloe  How much is your due   Post:  Eighteen pence  Streph:  Alas  my freind  I have but a bad guinea with which I mean to support myself in Town  But I will pawn to you an undirected Letter that I received from Chloe   Post:  Sir  I accept your offer   END OF THE FIRST ACT      A LETTER from a YOUNG LADY  whose feelings being too strong for  her Judgement led her into the commission of Errors which her Heart disapproved   Many have been the cares and vicissitudes of my past life  my beloved Ellinor  and the only consolation I feel for their bitterness is that on a close examination of my conduct  I am convinced that I have strictly deserved them  I murdered my father at a very early period of my Life  I have since murdered my Mother  and I am now going to murder my Sister  I have changed my religion so often that at present I have not an idea of any left  I have been a perjured witness in every public tryal for these last twelve years;

and proceeded on our tour through Wales  which is a principality contiguous to England and gives the title to the Prince of Wales  We travelled on horseback by preference  My Mother rode upon our little poney and Fanny and I walked by her side or rather ran  for my Mother is so fond of riding fast that she galloped all the way  You may be sure that we were in a fine perspiration when we came to our place of resting  Fanny has taken a great many Drawings of the Country  which are very beautiful  tho  perhaps not such exact resemblances as might be wished  from their being taken as she ran along  It would astonish you to see all the Shoes we wore out in our Tour  We determined to take a good Stock with us and therefore each took a pair of our own besides those we set off in  However we were obliged to have them both capped and heelpeiced at Carmarthen  and at last when they were quite gone  Mama was so kind as to lend us a pair of blue Sattin Slippers  of which we each took one and hopped home from Hereford delightfully—-I am your ever affectionate Elizabeth Johnson       A TALE   A Gentleman whose family name I shall conceal  bought a small Cottage in Pembrokeshire about two years ago  This daring Action was suggested to him by his elder Brother who promised to furnish two rooms and a Closet for him  provided he would take a small house near the borders of an extensive Forest  and about three Miles from the Sea  Wilhelminus gladly accepted the offer and continued for some time searching after such a retreat when he was one morning agreably releived from his suspence by reading this advertisement in a Newspaper   TO BE LETT A Neat Cottage on the borders of an extensive forest and about three Miles from the Sea  It is ready furnished except two rooms and a Closet   The delighted Wilhelminus posted away immediately to his brother  and shewed him the advertisement  Robertus congratulated him and sent him in his Carriage to take possession of the Cottage  After travelling for three days and six nights without stopping  they arrived at the Forest and following a track which led by it s side down a steep Hill over which ten Rivulets meandered  they reached the Cottage in half an hour  Wilhelminus alighted  and after knocking for some time without receiving any answer or hearing any one stir within  he opened the door which was fastened only by a wooden latch and entered a small room  which he immediately perceived to be one of the two that were unfurnished—From thence he proceeded into a Closet equally bare  A pair of stairs that went out of it led him into a room above  no less destitute  and these apartments he found composed the whole of the House  He was by no means displeased with this discovery  as he had the comfort of reflecting that he should not be obliged to lay out anything on furniture himself—  He returned immediately to his Brother  who took him the next day to every Shop in Town  and bought what ever was requisite to furnish the two rooms and the Closet  In a few days everything was completed  and Wilhelminus returned to take possession of his Cottage  Robertus accompanied him  with his Lady the amiable Cecilia and her two lovely Sisters Arabella and Marina to whom Wilhelminus was tenderly attached  and a large number of Attendants —An ordinary Genius might probably have been embarrassed  in endeavouring to accomodate so large a party  but Wilhelminus with admirable presence of mind gave orders for the immediate erection of two noble Tents in an open spot in the Forest adjoining to the house  Their Construction was both simple and elegant—A couple of old blankets  each supported by four sticks  gave a striking proof of that taste for architecture and that happy ease in overcoming difficulties which were some of Wilhelminus s most striking Virtues   
_BOOKEND_
Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she were here again  What a pity it is that Mr  Weston ever thought of her!
I cannot agree with you  papa; you know I cannot  Mr  Weston is such a good-humoured  pleasant  excellent man  that he thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever  and bear all my odd humours  when she might have a house of her own 
A house of her own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her own  This is three times as large —And you have never any odd humours  my dear 
How often we shall be going to see them  and they coming to see us!—We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon 
My dear  how am I to get so far  Randalls is such a distance  I could not walk half so far 
No  papa  nobody thought of your walking  We must go in the carriage  to be sure 
The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit 
They are to be put into Mr  Weston s stable  papa  You know we have settled all that already  We talked it all over with Mr  Weston last night  And as for James  you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls  because of his daughter s being housemaid there  I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else  That was your doing  papa  You got Hannah that good place  Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her—James is so obliged to you!
I am very glad I did think of her  It was very lucky  for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil  pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her  Whenever I see her  she always curtseys and asks me how I do  in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework  I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it  I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see  Whenever James goes over to see his daughter  you know  she will be hearing of us  He will be able to tell her how we all are 
poor Isabella
It is very kind of you  Mr  Knightley  to come out at this late hour to call upon us  I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk 
Not at all  sir  It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire 
But you must have found it very damp and dirty  I wish you may not catch cold 
Dirty  sir! Look at my shoes  Not a speck on them 
Well! that is quite surprising  for we have had a vast deal of rain here  It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast  I wanted them to put off the wedding 
By the bye—I have not wished you joy  Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling  I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well  How did you all behave  Who cried most 
Ah! poor Miss Taylor!  Tis a sad business 
Poor Mr  and Miss Woodhouse  if you please; but I cannot possibly say  poor Miss Taylor   I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate  it must be better to have only one to please than two 
Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful  troublesome creature!
That is what you have in your head  I know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by 
I believe it is very true  my dear  indeed 
I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome 
My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you  or suppose Mr  Knightley to mean you  What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself  Mr  Knightley loves to find fault with me  you know—in a joke—it is all a joke  We always say what we like to one another 
Emma knows I never flatter her 
but I meant no reflection on any body  Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she will now have but one  The chances are that she must be a gainer 
Well 
you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you  for we all behaved charmingly  Every body was punctual  every body in their best looks: not a tear  and hardly a long face to be seen  Oh no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart  and were sure of meeting every day 
Dear Emma bears every thing so well 
But  Mr  Knightley  she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor  and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for 
It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion 
We should not like her so well as we do  sir  if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor s advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be  at Miss Taylor s time of life  to be settled in a home of her own  and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision  and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure  Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married 
And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me 
and a very considerable one—that I made the match myself  I made the match  you know  four years ago; and to have it take place  and be proved in the right  when so many people said Mr  Weston would never marry again  may comfort me for any thing 
Ah! my dear  I wish you would not make matches and foretell things  for whatever you say always comes to pass  Pray do not make any more matches 
   said Mr  Knightley  
    rejoined Mr  Woodhouse  understanding but in part  
    said Mr  Knightley  laughing  
     CHAPTER II  Mr  Weston was a native of Highbury  and born of a respectable family  which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property  He had received a good education  but  on succeeding early in life to a small independence  had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged  and had satisfied an active  cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county  then embodied   Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill  of a great Yorkshire family  and Miss Churchill fell in love with him  nobody was surprized  except her brother and his wife  who had never seen him  and who were full of pride and importance  which the connexion would offend   Miss Churchill  however  being of age  and with the full command of her fortune—though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate—was not to be dissuaded from the marriage  and it took place  to the infinite mortification of Mr  and Mrs  Churchill  who threw her off with due decorum  It was an unsuitable connexion  and did not produce much happiness  Mrs  Weston ought to have found more in it  for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit  she had not the best  She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother  but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother s unreasonable anger  nor from missing the luxuries of her former home  They lived beyond their income  but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband  but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston  and Miss Churchill of Enscombe   Captain Weston  who had been considered  especially by the Churchills  as making such an amazing match  was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died  after a three years  marriage  he was rather a poorer man than at first  and with a child to maintain  From the expense of the child  however  he was soon relieved  The boy had  with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother s  been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr  and Mrs  Churchill  having no children of their own  nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for  offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease  Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations  the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills  and he had only his own comfort to seek  and his own situation to improve as he could   A complete change of life became desirable  He quitted the militia and engaged in trade  having brothers already established in a good way in London  which afforded him a favourable opening  It was a concern which brought just employment enough  He had still a small house in Highbury  where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society  the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away  He had  by that time  realised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury  which he had always longed for—enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor  and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition   It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth  it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls  and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on  with these objects in view  till they were accomplished  He had made his fortune  bought his house  and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence  with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through  He had never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that  even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be  and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen  to excite gratitude than to feel it   He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for as to Frank  it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle s heir  it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age  It was most unlikely  therefore  that he should ever want his father s assistance  His father had no apprehension of it  The aunt was a capricious woman  and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr  Weston s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear  and  as he believed  so deservedly dear  He saw his son every year in London  and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too  He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern   Mr  Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury  and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed  though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life  His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved   Now  upon his father s marriage  it was very generally proposed  as a most proper attention  that the visit should take place  There was not a dissentient voice on the subject  either when Mrs  Perry drank tea with Mrs  and Miss Bates  or when Mrs  and Miss Bates returned the visit  Now was the time for Mr  Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion  For a few days  every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs  Weston had received   It was  indeed  a highly prized letter  Mrs  Weston had  of course  formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense  and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured  She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought  where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled  and who could ill bear to part with her   She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think  without pain  of Emma s losing a single pleasure  or suffering an hour s ennui  from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been  and had sense  and energy  and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations  And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield  so convenient for even solitary female walking  and in Mr  Weston s disposition and circumstances  which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together   Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs  Weston  and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more than satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment  was so just and so apparent  that Emma  well as she knew her father  was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity  poor Miss Taylor   when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort  or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own  But never did she go without Mr  Woodhouse s giving a gentle sigh  and saying   There was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr  Woodhouse  The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake  which had been a great distress to him  was all eat up  His own stomach could bear nothing rich  and he could never believe other people to be different from himself  What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had  therefore  earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all  and when that proved vain  as earnestly tried to prevent any body s eating it  He had been at the pains of consulting Mr  Perry  the apothecary  on the subject  Mr  Perry was an intelligent  gentlemanlike man  whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr  Woodhouse s life; and upon being applied to  he could not but acknowledge  though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination  that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many—perhaps with most people  unless taken moderately  With such an opinion  in confirmation of his own  Mr  Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone   There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs  Weston s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr  Woodhouse would never believe it       CHAPTER III  Mr  Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way  He liked very much to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes  from his long residence at Hartfield  and his good nature  from his fortune  his house  and his daughter  he could command the visits of his own little circle  in a great measure  as he liked  He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late hours  and large dinner-parties  made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms  Fortunately for him  Highbury  including Randalls in the same parish  and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining  the seat of Mr  Knightley  comprehended many such  Not unfrequently  through Emma s persuasion  he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred; and  unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company  there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him   Real  long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr  Knightley; and by Mr  Elton  a young man living alone without liking it  the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr  Woodhouse s drawing-room  and the smiles of his lovely daughter  was in no danger of being thrown away   After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs  and Miss Bates  and Mrs  Goddard  three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield  and who were fetched and carried home so often  that Mr  Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses  Had it taken place only once a year  it would have been a grievance   Mrs  Bates  the widow of a former vicar of Highbury  was a very old lady  almost past every thing but tea and quadrille  She lived with her single daughter in a very small way  and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady  under such untoward circumstances  can excite  Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young  handsome  rich  nor married  Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself  or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect  She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness  Her youth had passed without distinction  and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother  and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible  And yet she was a happy woman  and a woman whom no one named without good-will  It was her own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders  She loved every body  was interested in every body s happiness  quicksighted to every body s merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature  and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother  and so many good neighbours and friends  and a home that wanted for nothing  The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature  her contented and grateful spirit  were a recommendation to every body  and a mine of felicity to herself  She was a great talker upon little matters  which exactly suited Mr  Woodhouse  full of trivial communications and harmless gossip   Mrs  Goddard was the mistress of a School—not of a seminary  or an establishment  or any thing which professed  in long sentences of refined nonsense  to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality  upon new principles and new systems—and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity—but a real  honest  old-fashioned Boarding-school  where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price  and where girls might be sent to be out of the way  and scramble themselves into a little education  without any danger of coming back prodigies  Mrs  Goddard s school was in high repute—and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden  gave the children plenty of wholesome food  let them run about a great deal in the summer  and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands  It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church  She was a plain  motherly kind of woman  who had worked hard in her youth  and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr  Woodhouse s kindness  felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour  hung round with fancy-work  whenever she could  and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside   These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect; and happy was she  for her father s sake  in the power; though  as far as she was herself concerned  it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs  Weston  She was delighted to see her father look comfortable  and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated   As she sat one morning  looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day  a note was brought from Mrs  Goddard  requesting  in most respectful terms  to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen  whom Emma knew very well by sight  and had long felt an interest in  on account of her beauty  A very gracious invitation was returned  and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion   Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody  Somebody had placed her  several years back  at Mrs  Goddard s school  and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder  This was all that was generally known of her history  She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury  and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her   She was a very pretty girl  and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired  She was short  plump  and fair  with a fine bloom  blue eyes  light hair  regular features  and a look of great sweetness  and  before the end of the evening  Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person  and quite determined to continue the acquaintance   She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith s conversation  but she found her altogether very engaging—not inconveniently shy  not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing  shewing so proper and becoming a deference  seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield  and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to  that she must have good sense  and deserve encouragement  Encouragement should be given  Those soft blue eyes  and all those natural graces  should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions  The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her  The friends from whom she had just parted  though very good sort of people  must be doing her harm  They were a family of the name of Martin  whom Emma well knew by character  as renting a large farm of Mr  Knightley  and residing in the parish of Donwell—very creditably  she believed—she knew Mr  Knightley thought highly of them—but they must be coarse and unpolished  and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect  She would notice her; she would improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance  and introduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners  It would be an interesting  and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life  her leisure  and powers   She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes  in talking and listening  and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens  that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table  which always closed such parties  and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time  was all set out and ready  and moved forwards to the fire  before she was aware  With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively  with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas  did she then do all the honours of the meal  and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters  with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests   Upon such occasions poor Mr  Woodhouse s feelings were in sad warfare  He loved to have the cloth laid  because it had been the fashion of his youth  but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing  his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat   Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could  with thorough self-approbation  recommend; though he might constrain himself  while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things  to say:   Emma allowed her father to talk—but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style  and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy  The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions  Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury  that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble  grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings  delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening  and actually shaken hands with her at last!      CHAPTER IV  Harriet Smith s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing  Quick and decided in her ways  Emma lost no time in inviting  encouraging  and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased  so did their satisfaction in each other  As a walking companion  Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her  In that respect Mrs  Weston s loss had been important  Her father never went beyond the shrubbery  where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk  or his short  as the year varied; and since Mrs  Weston s marriage her exercise had been too much confined  She had ventured once alone to Randalls  but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith  therefore  one whom she could summon at any time to a walk  would be a valuable addition to her privileges  But in every respect  as she saw more of her  she approved her  and was confirmed in all her kind designs   Harriet certainly was not clever  but she had a sweet  docile  grateful disposition  was totally free from conceit  and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to  Her early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company  and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever  shewed that there was no want of taste  though strength of understanding must not be expected  Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith s being exactly the young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required  Such a friend as Mrs  Weston was out of the question  Two such could never be granted  Two such she did not want  It was quite a different sort of thing  a sentiment distinct and independent  Mrs  Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem  Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful  For Mrs  Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing   Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents  but Harriet could not tell  She was ready to tell every thing in her power  but on this subject questions were vain  Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked—but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth  Harriet had no penetration  She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs  Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther   Mrs  Goddard  and the teachers  and the girls and the affairs of the school in general  formed naturally a great part of the conversation—and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm  it must have been the whole  But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them  and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit  and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place  Emma encouraged her talkativeness—amused by such a picture of another set of beings  and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs  Martin s having  For some time she was amused  without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but as she came to understand the family better  other feelings arose  She had taken up a wrong idea  fancying it was a mother and daughter  a son and son s wife  who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr  Martin  who bore a part in the narrative  and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other  was a single man; that there was no young Mrs  Martin  no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness  and that  if she were not taken care of  she might be required to sink herself forever   With this inspiriting notion  her questions increased in number and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr  Martin  and there was evidently no dislike to it  Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and obliging  He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts  because she had said how fond she was of them  and in every thing else he was so very obliging  He had his shepherd s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her  She was very fond of singing  He could sing a little himself  She believed he was very clever  and understood every thing  He had a very fine flock  and  while she was with them  he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country  She believed every body spoke well of him  His mother and sisters were very fond of him  Mrs  Martin had told her one day  and there was a blush as she said it   that it was impossible for any body to be a better son  and therefore she was sure  whenever he married  he would make a good husband  Not that she wanted him to marry  She was in no hurry at all    thought Emma  
    The next question was—                Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech  and saw no alarming symptoms of love  The young man had been the first admirer  but she trusted there was no other hold  and that there would be no serious difficulty  on Harriet s side  to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own   They met Mr  Martin the very next day  as they were walking on the Donwell road  He was on foot  and after looking very respectfully at her  looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion  Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward  while they talked together  soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr  Robert Martin  His appearance was very neat  and he looked like a sensible young man  but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen  she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet s inclination  Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder  Mr  Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was   They remained but a few minutes together  as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face  and in a flutter of spirits  which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose      said Harriet  in a mortified voice  
            She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr  Elton  and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled  and said she had always thought Mr  Elton very agreeable   Mr  Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet s head  She thought it would be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable  natural  and probable  for her to have much merit in planning it  She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict  It was not likely  however  that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan  as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet s coming to Hartfield  The longer she considered it  the greater was her sense of its expediency  Mr  Elton s situation was most suitable  quite the gentleman himself  and without low connexions; at the same time  not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet  He had a comfortable home for her  and Emma imagined a very sufficient income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large  he was known to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him as a good-humoured  well-meaning  respectable young man  without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world   She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl  which she trusted  with such frequent meetings at Hartfield  was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy  And he was really a very pleasing young man  a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like  He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general  though not by her  there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr  Elton s admiration       CHAPTER V   said Mr  Knightley  
        replied Mrs  Weston  smiling  
 —said Mr  Knightley  feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done  
 he soon added  
   said he  smiling  
           he replied  
     cried he; 
   said he  
  said Mrs  Weston gently  
   said Mrs  Weston  
 Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr  Weston s on the subject  as much as possible  There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma s destiny  but it was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr  Knightley soon afterwards made to      CHAPTER VI  Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose  for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr  Elton s being a remarkably handsome man  with most agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints  she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet s side  as there could be any occasion for  She was quite convinced of Mr  Elton s being in the fairest way of falling in love  if not in love already  She had no scruple with regard to him  He talked of Harriet  and praised her so warmly  that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add  His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet s manner  since her introduction at Hartfield  was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment    said he; 
        said she: 
 Harriet was on the point of leaving the room  and only stopt to say  with a very interesting naivete    No sooner was she out of sight  than Emma exclaimed     cried Mr  Elton; 
 Yes  good man!—thought Emma—but what has all that to do with taking likenesses  You know nothing of drawing  Don t pretend to be in raptures about mine  Keep your raptures for Harriet s face      Harriet was soon back again  and the proposal almost immediately made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others  Emma wished to go to work directly  and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits  for not one of them had ever been finished  that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet  Her many beginnings were displayed  Miniatures  half-lengths  whole-lengths  pencil  crayon  and water-colours had been all tried in turn  She had always wanted to do every thing  and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to  She played and sang;—and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command  and ought not to have failed of  She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician  but she was not unwilling to have others deceived  or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved   There was merit in every drawing—in the least finished  perhaps the most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less  or had there been ten times more  the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same  They were both in ecstasies  A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse s performances must be capital    said Emma  
—unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size  whole-length—
—after all this  came poor dear Isabella s cold approbation of—
 Mr  Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea  and was repeating   She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait  It was to be a whole-length in water-colours  like Mr  John Knightley s  and was destined  if she could please herself  to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece   The sitting began; and Harriet  smiling and blushing  and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance  presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist  But there was no doing any thing  with Mr  Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch  She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it  and request him to place himself elsewhere  It then occurred to her to employ him in reading    Mr  Elton was only too happy  Harriet listened  and Emma drew in peace  She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil  to jump up and see the progress  and be charmed —There was no being displeased with such an encourager  for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible  She could not respect his eye  but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable   The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on  There was no want of likeness  she had been fortunate in the attitude  and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure  to give a little more height  and considerably more elegance  she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last  and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both—a standing memorial of the beauty of one  the skill of the other  and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr  Elton s very promising attachment was likely to add   Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr  Elton  just as he ought  entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again    The same civilities and courtesies  the same success and satisfaction  took place on the morrow  and accompanied the whole progress of the picture  which was rapid and happy  Every body who saw it was pleased  but Mr  Elton was in continual raptures  and defended it through every criticism   —observed Mrs  Weston to him—not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover —
  replied he  
  Emma knew that she had  but would not own it; and Mr  Elton warmly added     said Mr  Woodhouse  
    cried Mr  Elton  
 The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few difficulties  It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on; and Isabella  the usual doer of all commissions  must not be applied to  because it was December  and Mr  Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December  But no sooner was the distress known to Mr  Elton  than it was removed  His gallantry was always on the alert    Mr  Elton was to take the drawing to London  chuse the frame  and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him  while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough     thought Emma  
     CHAPTER VII  The very day of Mr  Elton s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma s services towards her friend  Harriet had been at Hartfield  as usual  soon after breakfast; and  after a time  had gone home to return again to dinner: she returned  and sooner than had been talked of  and with an agitated  hurried look  announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell  Half a minute brought it all out  She had heard  as soon as she got back to Mrs  Goddard s  that Mr  Martin had been there an hour before  and finding she was not at home  nor particularly expected  had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters  and gone away; and on opening this parcel  she had actually found  besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy  a letter to herself; and this letter was from him  from Mr  Martin  and contained a direct proposal of marriage    she cried  
  cried Harriet  
 Emma was not sorry to be pressed  She read  and was surprized  The style of the letter was much above her expectation  There were not merely no grammatical errors  but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language  though plain  was strong and unaffected  and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer  It was short  but expressed good sense  warm attachment  liberality  propriety  even delicacy of feeling  She paused over it  while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion  with a  and was at last forced to add  
  replied Emma rather slowly—
  said the still waiting Harriet;—
        Harriet was silent  With a little reserve of manner  Emma continued:         said Emma  smiling graciously  
 The symptoms were favourable —Instead of answering  Harriet turned away confused  and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was still in her hand  it was now mechanically twisted about without regard  Emma waited the result with impatience  but not without strong hopes  At last  with some hesitation  Harriet said—    Harriet had not surmised her own danger  but the idea of it struck her forcibly    she cried  looking aghast  
     said Harriet  her conscience opposing such censure; 
   Emma felt the bad taste of her friend  but let it pass with a   Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer  and advised its being written directly  which was agreed to  in the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted  it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence  The looking over his letter again  in replying to it  had such a softening tendency  that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy  and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say  and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful  that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment  he would have been accepted after all   This letter  however  was written  and sealed  and sent  The business was finished  and Harriet safe  She was rather low all the evening  but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets  and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection  sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr  Elton      Some time afterwards it was    Harriet blushed and smiled  and said something about wondering that people should like her so much  The idea of Mr  Elton was certainly cheering; but still  after a time  she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr  Martin    said she softly  
  cried Emma  
   Harriet smiled again  and her smiles grew stronger       CHAPTER VIII  Harriet slept at Hartfield that night  For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there  and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every respect  safest and kindest  to keep her with them as much as possible just at present  She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs  Goddard s  but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield  to make a regular visit of some days   While she was gone  Mr  Knightley called  and sat some time with Mr  Woodhouse and Emma  till Mr  Woodhouse  who had previously made up his mind to walk out  was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it  and was induced by the entreaties of both  though against the scruples of his own civility  to leave Mr  Knightley for that purpose  Mr  Knightley  who had nothing of ceremony about him  was offering by his short  decided answers  an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other         Mr  Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr  Knightley  instead of being immediately off likewise  sat down again  seemingly inclined for more chat  He began speaking of Harriet  and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before    said he; 
   said he  
       Emma knew this was too true for contradiction  and therefore said nothing  He presently added  with a smile       Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr  Elton s having dropt a hint  Mr  Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser  and she knew Mr  Elton looked up to him    he replied  
  said Emma; 
   said Emma  who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech  
  replied he  surprized  
  said she  
 This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr  Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure  as he stood up  in tall indignation  and said     cried Emma  
      exclaimed Mr  Knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity  added  a few moments afterwards  
     said Mr  Knightley  
 It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again      cried she playfully  
  said Mr  Knightley presently  
   cried Mr  Knightley —
 Emma made no answer  and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned  but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone  She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general  which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state  was very disagreeable  Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence  with only one attempt on Emma s side to talk of the weather  but he made no answer  He was thinking  The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words    Emma laughed and disclaimed  He continued     said Emma  laughing again  
  Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her s  than in his  She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself  so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary s wrong  as Mr  Knightley  He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her  She was not so materially cast down  however  but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives  Harriet s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy  The possibility of the young man s coming to Mrs  Goddard s that morning  and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause  gave alarming ideas  The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared  and in very good spirits  and without having any such reason to give for her long absence  she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind  and convinced her  that let Mr  Knightley think or say what he would  she had done nothing which woman s friendship and woman s feelings would not justify   He had frightened her a little about Mr  Elton; but when she considered that Mr  Knightley could not have observed him as she had done  neither with the interest  nor  she must be allowed to tell herself  in spite of Mr  Knightley s pretensions  with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself  that he had spoken it hastily and in anger  she was able to believe  that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true  than what he knew any thing about  He certainly might have heard Mr  Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done  and Mr  Elton might not be of an imprudent  inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then  Mr  Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives  Mr  Knightley saw no such passion  and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable  becoming degree of prudence  she was very sure did not belong to Mr  Elton   Harriet s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back  not to think of Mr  Martin  but to talk of Mr  Elton  Miss Nash had been telling her something  which she repeated immediately with great delight  Mr  Perry had been to Mrs  Goddard s to attend a sick child  and Miss Nash had seen him  and he had told Miss Nash  that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park  he had met Mr  Elton  and found to his great surprize  that Mr  Elton was actually on his road to London  and not meaning to return till the morrow  though it was the whist-club night  which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr  Perry had remonstrated with him about it  and told him how shabby it was in him  their best player  to absent himself  and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr  Elton had been determined to go on  and had said in a very particular way indeed  that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission  and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious  Mr  Perry could not quite understand him  but he was very sure there must be a lady in the case  and he told him so; and Mr  Elton only looked very conscious and smiling  and rode off in great spirits  Miss Nash had told her all this  and had talked a great deal more about Mr  Elton; and said  looking so very significantly at her       CHAPTER IX  Mr  Knightley might quarrel with her  but Emma could not quarrel with herself  He was so much displeased  that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet  his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven  She was sorry  but could not repent  On the contrary  her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days   The Picture  elegantly framed  came safely to hand soon after Mr  Elton s return  and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room  he got up to look at it  and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet s feelings  they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted  Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr  Martin s being no otherwise remembered  than as he furnished a contrast with Mr  Elton  of the utmost advantage to the latter   Her views of improving her little friend s mind  by a great deal of useful reading and conversation  had never yet led to more than a few first chapters  and the intention of going on to-morrow  It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet s fortune  than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present  the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life  was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with  into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper  made up by her friend  and ornamented with ciphers and trophies   In this age of literature  such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon  Miss Nash  head-teacher at Mrs  Goddard s  had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet  who had taken the first hint of it from her  hoped  with Miss Woodhouse s help  to get a great many more  Emma assisted with her invention  memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand  it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order  in form as well as quantity   Mr  Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls  and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in   And it always ended in 
 His good friend Perry  too  whom he had spoken to on the subject  did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch  and as he went about so much  something  he thought  might come from that quarter   It was by no means his daughter s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition  Mr  Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked  He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas  charades  or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time  as she could perceive  most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant  nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips  They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled  and rather sentimentally recited  that well-known charade       My first doth affliction denote        Which my second is destin d to feel     And my whole is the best antidote       That affliction to soften and heal —  made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already    said she; 
 —he stopt a moment—
 The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration  He called for a few moments  just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing  as he said  a charade  which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady  the object of his admiration  but which  from his manner  Emma was immediately convinced must be his own    said he  
 The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet  which Emma could understand  There was deep consciousness about him  and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend s  He was gone the next moment:—after another moment s pause    said Emma  smiling  and pushing the paper towards Harriet—
 But Harriet was in a tremor  and could not touch it; and Emma  never loth to be first  was obliged to examine it herself           To Miss—            CHARADE       My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings        Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease      Another view of man  my second brings        Behold him there  the monarch of the seas!      But ah! united  what reverse we have!       Man s boasted power and freedom  all are flown;     Lord of the earth and sea  he bends a slave        And woman  lovely woman  reigns alone         Thy ready wit the word will soon supply        May its approval beam in that soft eye!  She cast her eye over it  pondered  caught the meaning  read it through again to be quite certain  and quite mistress of the lines  and then passing it to Harriet  sat happily smiling  and saying to herself  while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness   She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations  which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length  by the eagerness of Harriet s wondering questions     Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion  She read the concluding lines  and was all flutter and happiness  She could not speak  But she was not wanted to speak  It was enough for her to feel  Emma spoke for her    said she  
 —and 
  cried Harriet  
            Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear  The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind    said she  presently—her cheeks in a glow—
 Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr  Martin s prose    continued Harriet—
     — Harriet submitted  though her mind could hardly separate the parts  so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love  It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity     replied Emma; 
 Harriet looked grave     Mr  Woodhouse came in  and very soon led to the subject again  by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of   She read it to him  just as he liked to have any thing read  slowly and distinctly  and two or three times over  with explanations of every part as she proceeded—and he was very much pleased  and  as she had foreseen  especially struck with the complimentary conclusion    Emma only nodded  and smiled —After a little thinking  and a very tender sigh  he added              Mr  Woodhouse could never allow for Mr  Knightley s claims on his brother  or any body s claims on Isabella  except his own  He sat musing a little while  and then said     This was too true for contradiction  Unwelcome as it was  Mr  Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter s attachment to her husband  she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them        said Emma  
     Later in the morning  and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o clock dinner  the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again  Harriet turned away; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile  and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up  His ostensible reason  however  was to ask whether Mr  Woodhouse s party could be made up in the evening without him  or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield  If he were  every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him—had made such a point of it  that he had promised him conditionally to come   Emma thanked him  but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber  He re-urged—she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow  when taking the paper from the table  she returned it—   Mr  Elton certainly did not very well know what to say  He looked rather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about    replied Mr  Elton  though hesitating a good deal while he spoke; 
 After this speech he was gone as soon as possible  Emma could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities  there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh  She ran away to indulge the inclination  leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet s share       CHAPTER X  Though now the middle of December  there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the morrow  Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family  who lived a little way out of Highbury   Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane  a lane leading at right angles from the broad  though irregular  main street of the place; and  as may be inferred  containing the blessed abode of Mr  Elton  A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed  and then  about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage  an old and not very good house  almost as close to the road as it could be  It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and  such as it was  there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes —Emma s remark was—     said Emma  as they proceeded  
 Harriet  she found  had never in her life been inside the Vicarage  and her curiosity to see it was so extreme  that  considering exteriors and probabilities  Emma could only class it  as a proof of love  with Mr  Elton s seeing ready wit in her    said she; 
 She pondered  but could think of nothing  After a mutual silence of some minutes  Harriet thus began again—   Emma laughed  and replied                They were now approaching the cottage  and all idle topics were superseded  Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness  her counsel and her patience  as from her purse  She understood their ways  could allow for their ignorance and their temptations  had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy  and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will  In the present instance  it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice  she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet  as they walked away     said Harriet  
  said Emma  as she crossed the low hedge  and tottering footstep which ended the narrow  slippery path through the cottage garden  and brought them into the lane again  
  They walked on  The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was passed  Mr  Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther    Harriet could just answer    thought Emma; 
 Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could  she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath  a little raised on one side of the lane  leaving them together in the main road  But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too  and that  in short  they would both be soon after her  This would not do; she immediately stopped  under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half-boot  and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath  begged them to have the goodness to walk on  and she would follow in half a minute  They did as they were desired; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot  she had the comfort of farther delay in her power  being overtaken by a child from the cottage  setting out  according to orders  with her pitcher  to fetch broth from Hartfield  To walk by the side of this child  and talk to and question her  was the most natural thing in the world  or would have been the most natural  had she been acting just then without design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead  without any obligation of waiting for her  She gained on them  however  involuntarily: the child s pace was quick  and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it  from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them  Mr  Elton was speaking with animation  Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma  having sent the child on  was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more  when they both looked around  and she was obliged to join them   Mr  Elton was still talking  still engaged in some interesting detail; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday s party at his friend Cole s  and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese  the north Wiltshire  the butter  the celery  the beet-root  and all the dessert    was her consoling reflection; 
 They now walked on together quietly  till within view of the vicarage pales  when a sudden resolution  of at least getting Harriet into the house  made her again find something very much amiss about her boot  and fall behind to arrange it once more  She then broke the lace off short  and dexterously throwing it into a ditch  was presently obliged to entreat them to stop  and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort    said she  
 Mr  Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage  The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied  and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between them was open  and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner  She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr  Elton should close it  It was not closed  however  it still remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation  she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room  For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself  It could be protracted no longer  She was then obliged to be finished  and make her appearance   The lovers were standing together at one of the windows  It had a most favourable aspect; and  for half a minute  Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully  But it would not do; he had not come to the point  He had been most agreeable  most delightful; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by  and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt  but nothing serious    thought Emma; 
 Still  however  though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device  she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both  and must be leading them forward to the great event       CHAPTER XI  Mr  Elton must now be left to himself  It was no longer in Emma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures  The coming of her sister s family was so very near at hand  that first in anticipation  and then in reality  it became henceforth her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected—she did not herself expect—that any thing beyond occasional  fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers  They might advance rapidly if they would  however; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no  She hardly wished to have more leisure for them  There are people  who the more you do for them  the less they will do for themselves   Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley  from having been longer than usual absent from Surry  were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest  Till this year  every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children  and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions  or seen at all by Mr  Woodhouse  who could not be induced to get so far as London  even for poor Isabella s sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit   He thought much of the evils of the journey for her  and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished  and Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley  their five children  and a competent number of nursery-maids  all reaching Hartfield in safety  The bustle and joy of such an arrival  the many to be talked to  welcomed  encouraged  and variously dispersed and disposed of  produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause  nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs  John Knightley  that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones  and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance  all the eating and drinking  and sleeping and playing  which they could possibly wish for  without the smallest delay  the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him  either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them   Mrs  John Knightley was a pretty  elegant little woman  of gentle  quiet manners  and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife  a doating mother  and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that  but for these higher ties  a warmer love might have seemed impossible  She could never see a fault in any of them  She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her father  she inherited also much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health  over-careful of that of her children  had many fears and many nerves  and was as fond of her own Mr  Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr  Perry  They were alike too  in a general benevolence of temper  and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance   Mr  John Knightley was a tall  gentleman-like  and very clever man; rising in his profession  domestic  and respectable in his private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour  He was not an ill-tempered man  not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and  indeed  with such a worshipping wife  it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased  The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his  He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted  and he could sometimes act an ungracious  or say a severe thing   He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law  Nothing wrong in him escaped her  She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella  which Isabella never felt herself  Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella s sister  but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend  without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into  the want of respectful forbearance towards her father  There he had not always the patience that could have been wished  Mr  Woodhouse s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed  It did not often happen; for Mr  John Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law  and generally a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma s charity  especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured  though the offence came not  The beginning  however  of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings  and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality  They had not been long seated and composed when Mr  Woodhouse  with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh  called his daughter s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last    said he  
  cried she with ready sympathy  
  Mr  John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls      Mr  Woodhouse hesitated —   said Mr  John Knightley  
  said Mr  Woodhouse—
   said John Knightley pleasantly  
  cried his wife  hearing and understanding only in part — 
  said John Knightley  
  replied Emma  
  said her father  
    cried the good-hearted Mrs  John Knightley  
  observed Mr  John Knightley coolly  
 Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr  Weston  and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled  and let it pass  She would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits  the all-sufficiency of home to himself  whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse  and those to whom it was important —It had a high claim to forbearance       CHAPTER XII  Mr  Knightley was to dine with them—rather against the inclination of Mr  Woodhouse  who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella s first day  Emma s sense of right however had decided it; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother  she had particular pleasure  from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr  Knightley and herself  in procuring him the proper invitation   She hoped they might now become friends again  She thought it was time to make up  Making-up indeed would not do  She certainly had not been in the wrong  and he would never own that he had  Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship  that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her—the youngest  a nice little girl about eight months old  who was now making her first visit to Hartfield  and very happy to be danced about in her aunt s arms  It did assist; for though he began with grave looks and short questions  he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way  and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity  Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction  and then a little sauciness  she could not help saying  as he was admiring the baby       said he  smiling—
  she replied—
     she cried—
   This had just taken place and with great cordiality  when John Knightley made his appearance  and  and 
 The evening was quiet and conversable  as Mr  Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella  and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr  Knightleys; their subjects totally distinct  or very rarely mixing—and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other   The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits  but principally of those of the elder  whose temper was by much the most communicative  and who was always the greater talker  As a magistrate  he had generally some point of law to consult John about  or  at least  some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer  as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell  he had to tell what every field was to bear next year  and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life  and whose attachments were strong  The plan of a drain  the change of a fence  the felling of a tree  and the destination of every acre for wheat  turnips  or spring corn  was entered into with as much equality of interest by John  as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about  his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness   While they were thus comfortably occupied  Mr  Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter    said he  fondly taking her hand  and interrupting  for a few moments  her busy labours for some one of her five children—
 Emma could not suppose any such thing  knowing as she did  that both the Mr  Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;—and two basins only were ordered  After a little more discourse in praise of gruel  with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body  he proceeded to say  with an air of grave reflection       cried Emma  feeling this to be an unsafe subject  
      You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs  and Miss Bates 
I have not heard one inquiry after them 
Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them in most of your letters  I hope they are quite well  Good old Mrs  Bates—I will call upon her to-morrow  and take my children —They are always so pleased to see my children —And that excellent Miss Bates!—such thorough worthy people!—How are they  sir 
Why  pretty well  my dear  upon the whole  But poor Mrs  Bates had a bad cold about a month ago 
How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn  Mr  Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza 
That has been a good deal the case  my dear; but not to the degree you mention  Perry says that colds have been very general  but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November  Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season 
        —exclaimed he hastily—
  cried Emma  
 And she talked in this way so long and successfully that  when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister  she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax  though no great favourite with her in general  she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising    said Mrs  John Knightley —
 Mr  Woodhouse agreed to it all  but added     This topic was discussed very happily  and others succeeded of similar moment  and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation  The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said—much praise and many comments—undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution  and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;—but  unfortunately  among the failures which the daughter had to instance  the most recent  and therefore most prominent  was in her own cook at South End  a young woman hired for the time  who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel  thin  but not too thin  Often as she had wished for and ordered it  she had never been able to get any thing tolerable  Here was a dangerous opening    said Mr  Woodhouse  shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern —The ejaculation in Emma s ear expressed  
        Emma s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had reached such a point as this  she could not wonder at her brother-in-law s breaking out    said he  in a voice of very strong displeasure  
 He paused—and growing cooler in a moment  added  with only sarcastic dryness  
  cried Mr  Knightley  with most ready interposition—
 Mr  Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry  to whom he had  in fact  though unconsciously  been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;—but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil  and the immediate alertness of one brother  and better recollections of the other  prevented any renewal of it       CHAPTER XIII  There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs  John Knightley  in this short visit to Hartfield  going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children  and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister  She had nothing to wish otherwise  but that the days did not pass so swiftly  It was a delightful visit;—perfect  in being much too short   In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement  and out of the house too  there was no avoiding  though at Christmas  Mr  Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;—even Mr  Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party   How they were all to be conveyed  he would have made a difficulty if he could  but as his son and daughter s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield  he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also   Harriet  Mr  Elton  and Mr  Knightley  their own especial set  were the only persons invited to meet them;—the hours were to be early  as well as the numbers few; Mr  Woodhouse s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing   The evening before this great event  for it was a very great event that Mr  Woodhouse should dine out  on the 24th of December  had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield  and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold  that  but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs  Goddard  Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house  Emma called on her the next day  and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls  She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs  Goddard was full of care and affection  Mr  Perry was talked of  and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement  though she could not speak of her loss without many tears   Emma sat with her as long as she could  to attend her in Mrs  Goddard s unavoidable absences  and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr  Elton s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last tolerably comfortable  in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit  and of their all missing her very much  She had not advanced many yards from Mrs  Goddard s door  when she was met by Mr  Elton himself  evidently coming towards it  and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid—of whom he  on the rumour of considerable illness  had been going to inquire  that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield—they were overtaken by Mr  John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell  with his two eldest boys  whose healthy  glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run  and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for  They joined company and proceeded together  Emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint;—  Emma  who was not really at all frightened herself  tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs  Goddard s experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away  which she would rather feed and assist than not  she added soon afterwards—as if quite another subject    Mr  Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady  and not liking to resist any advice of her s  he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;—but Emma  too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially  or see him with clear vision  was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being   said she;—
 But hardly had she so spoken  when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage  if the weather were Mr  Elton s only objection  and Mr  Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction  It was a done thing; Mr  Elton was to go  and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his smile been stronger  nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her    said she to herself  
 Soon afterwards Mr  Elton quitted them  and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs  Goddard s for news of her fair friend  the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again  when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour   After a few minutes of entire silence between them  John Knightley began with—    replied Emma; 
  said Mr  John Knightley presently  with some slyness  
  she replied with a smile of astonishment  
     Mr  Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit  that in spite of the increasing coldness  he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it  and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage  with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own going  and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold  and too well wrapt up to feel it  The cold  however  was severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion  a few flakes of snow were finding their way down  and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time   Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour  The preparing and the going abroad in such weather  with the sacrifice of his children after dinner  were evils  were disagreeables at least  which Mr  John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent    said he  
 Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent  which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving  to emulate the  They arrived  the carriage turned  the step was let down  and Mr  Elton  spruce  black  and smiling  was with them instantly  Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject  Mr  Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed  that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her  She had sent while dressing  and the answer had been    said she presently  
 His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered    Emma smiled and answered—    This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer  Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things  and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment    said he  
  said John Knightley  
  observed Mr  Elton  
 Mr  John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure  but said only  coolly    At another time Emma might have been amused  but she was too much astonished now at Mr  Elton s spirits for other feelings  Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party    continued he  
    replied John Knightley  as they passed through the sweep-gate  
     CHAPTER XIV  Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs  Weston s drawing-room;—Mr  Elton must compose his joyous looks  and Mr  John Knightley disperse his ill-humour  Mr  Elton must smile less  and Mr  John Knightley more  to fit them for the place —Emma only might be as nature prompted  and shew herself just as happy as she was  To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons  Mr  Weston was a great favourite  and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve  as to his wife; not any one  to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood  of being always interesting and always intelligible  the little affairs  arrangements  perplexities  and pleasures of her father and herself  She could tell nothing of Hartfield  in which Mrs  Weston had not a lively concern; and half an hour s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends  was one of the first gratifications of each   This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day s visit might not afford  which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of Mrs  Weston  her smile  her touch  her voice was grateful to Emma  and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr  Elton s oddities  or of any thing else unpleasant  and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost   The misfortune of Harriet s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival  Mr  Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it  besides all the history of his own and Isabella s coming  and of Emma s being to follow  and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter  when the others appeared  and Mrs  Weston  who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him  was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma   Emma s project of forgetting Mr  Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find  when they had all taken their places  that he was close to her  The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet  from her mind  while he not only sat at her elbow  but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice  and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion  Instead of forgetting him  his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of —Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm  would be so interested about her father  and so delighted with Mrs  Weston; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover  and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners  For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet s  in the hope that all would yet turn out right  she was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others  in the most overpowering period of Mr  Elton s nonsense  which she particularly wished to listen to  She heard enough to know that Mr  Weston was giving some information about his son; she heard the words 
 and 
 and 
 Now  it so happened that in spite of Emma s resolution of never marrying  there was something in the name  in the idea of Mr  Frank Churchill  which always interested her  She had frequently thought—especially since his father s marriage with Miss Taylor—that if she were to marry  he was the very person to suit her in age  character and condition  He seemed by this connexion between the families  quite to belong to her  She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of  That Mr  and Mrs  Weston did think of it  she was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him  or by any body else  to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for  she had a great curiosity to see him  a decided intention of finding him pleasant  of being liked by him to a certain degree  and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends  imaginations   With such sensations  Mr  Elton s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite  while feeling very cross—and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again  or the substance of it  from the open-hearted Mr  Weston —So it proved;—for when happily released from Mr  Elton  and seated by Mr  Weston  at dinner  he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality  the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton  to say to her    Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to his proposition of Mr  Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete    continued Mr  Weston  
    replied Emma; 
  Emma liked the subject so well  that she began upon it  to Mrs  Weston  very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy—yet observing  that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming — Mrs  Weston agreed to it; but added  that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of:    replied Mrs  Weston  smiling  
 Then turning to Isabella  who had not been attending before—
  replied Isabella: 
 Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs  Weston  She should then have heard more: Mrs  Weston would speak to her  with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella; and  she really believed  would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her  excepting those views on the young man  of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge  But at present there was nothing more to be said  Mr  Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room  To be sitting long after dinner  was a confinement that he could not endure  Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable   While he talked to Isabella  however  Emma found an opportunity of saying      said Emma  
  replied Mrs  Weston  
   Emma listened  and then coolly said    continued Mrs  Weston  
     CHAPTER XV  Mr  Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three companions could do  to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour  before the other gentlemen appeared  Mr  Weston was chatty and convivial  and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation  Mr  Elton  in very good spirits  was one of the first to walk in  Mrs  Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa  He joined them immediately  and  with scarcely an invitation  seated himself between them   Emma  in good spirits too  from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr  Frank Churchill  was willing to forget his late improprieties  and be as well satisfied with him as before  and on his making Harriet his very first subject  was ready to listen with most friendly smiles   He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair  lovely  amiable friend   But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account  than on Harriet s—more anxious that she should escape the infection  than that there should be no infection in the complaint  He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again  for the present—to entreat her to promise him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr  Perry and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course  there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her  She was vexed  It did appear—there was no concealing it—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her  instead of Harriet; an inconstancy  if real  the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty in behaving with temper  He turned to Mrs  Weston to implore her assistance    he continued  
 Emma saw Mrs  Weston s surprize  and felt that it must be great  at an address which  in words and manner  was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her; and as for herself  she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose  She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses  and then left the sofa  removing to a seat by her sister  and giving her all her attention   She had not time to know how Mr  Elton took the reproof  so rapidly did another subject succeed; for Mr  John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather  and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow  and of its still snowing fast  with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr  Woodhouse:   Poor Mr  Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized  and had some question to ask  or some comfort to offer  Mrs  Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son-in-law  who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly    said he  
 Mr  Weston  with triumph of a different sort  was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time  but had not said a word  lest it should make Mr  Woodhouse uncomfortable  and be an excuse for his hurrying away  As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return  that was a mere joke; he was afraid they would find no difficulty  He wished the road might be impassable  that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body  calling on his wife to agree with him  that with a little contrivance  every body might be lodged  which she hardly knew how to do  from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house    His eldest daughter s alarm was equal to his own  The horror of being blocked up at Randalls  while her children were at Hartfield  was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people  but in a state that admitted no delay  she was eager to have it settled  that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls  while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them    said she; 
  replied he  
 Isabella turned to Mrs  Weston for her approbation of the plan  Mrs  Weston could only approve  Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point  when Mr  Knightley  who had left the room immediately after his brother s first report of the snow  came back again  and told them that he had been out of doors to examine  and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home  whenever they liked it  either now or an hour hence  He had gone beyond the sweep—some way along the Highbury road—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present  but the clouds were parting  and there was every appearance of its being soon over  He had seen the coachmen  and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend   To Isabella  the relief of such tidings was very great  and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father s account  who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls  He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home  but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending  Mr  Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus—      And the bell was rung  and the carriages spoken for  A few minutes more  and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house  to get sober and cool  and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over   The carriage came: and Mr  Woodhouse  always the first object on such occasions  was carefully attended to his own by Mr  Knightley and Mr  Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen  and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for   Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley  forgetting that he did not belong to their party  stept in after his wife very naturally; so that Emma found  on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr  Elton  that the door was to be lawfully shut on them  and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive  It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment  it would have been rather a pleasure  previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to him of Harriet  and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one  But now  she would rather it had not happened  She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr  Weston s good wine  and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense   To restrain him as much as might be  by her own manners  she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun  scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage  than she found her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded  and Mr  Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious opportunity  declaring sentiments which must be already well known  hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect  and in short  very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible  It really was so  Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent diffidence  Mr  Elton  the lover of Harriet  was professing himself her lover  She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on  and say it all  Angry as she was  the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak  She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness  and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour  Accordingly  with a mixture of the serious and the playful  which she hoped would best suit his half and half state  she replied      But Mr  Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits  not at all to confuse his intellects  He perfectly knew his own meaning; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious  and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend —but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all —he resumed the subject of his own passion  and was very urgent for a favourable answer   As she thought less of his inebriety  she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness  replied     cried Mr  Elton  
 It would be impossible to say what Emma felt  on hearing this—which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost  She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr  Elton s sanguine state of mind  he tried to take her hand again  as he joyously exclaimed—    cried Emma  
  cried he  affronted in his turn: 
  He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment  and mutually deep mortification  they had to continue together a few minutes longer  for the fears of Mr  Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace  If there had not been so much anger  there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment  Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane  or when it stopped  they found themselves  all at once  at the door of his house; and he was out before another syllable passed —Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night  The compliment was just returned  coldly and proudly; and  under indescribable irritation of spirits  she was then conveyed to Hartfield   There she was welcomed  with the utmost delight  by her father  who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane—turning a corner which he could never bear to think of—and in strange hands—a mere common coachman—no James; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr  John Knightley  ashamed of his ill-humour  was now all kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father  as to seem—if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel—perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party  except herself —But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection       CHAPTER XVI  The hair was curled  and the maid sent away  and Emma sat down to think and be miserable —It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of all  Every part of it brought pain and humiliation  of some sort or other; but  compared with the evil to Harriet  all was light; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken—more in error—more disgraced by mis-judgment  than she actually was  could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself    How she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet—never! She looked back as well as she could; but it was all confusion  She had taken up the idea  she supposed  and made every thing bend to it  His manners  however  must have been unmarked  wavering  dubious  or she could not have been so misled   The picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the charade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet  To be sure  the charade  with its —but then the 
 Certainly she had often  especially of late  thought his manners to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way  as a mere error of judgment  of knowledge  of taste  as one proof among others that he had not always lived in the best society  that with all the gentleness of his address  true elegance was sometimes wanting; but  till this very day  she had never  for an instant  suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet s friend   To Mr  John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject  for the first start of its possibility  There was no denying that those brothers had penetration  She remembered what Mr  Knightley had once said to her about Mr  Elton  the caution he had given  the conviction he had professed that Mr  Elton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself  It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr  Elton was proving himself  in many respects  the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him; proud  assuming  conceited; very full of his own claims  and little concerned about the feelings of others   Contrary to the usual course of things  Mr  Elton s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion  His professions and his proposals did him no service  She thought nothing of his attachment  and was insulted by his hopes  He wanted to marry well  and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her  pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for  There had been no real affection either in his language or manners  Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions  or fancy any tone of voice  less allied with real love  She need not trouble herself to pity him  He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield  the heiress of thirty thousand pounds  were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied  he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty  or with ten   But—that he should talk of encouragement  should consider her as aware of his views  accepting his attentions  meaning  in short   to marry him!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down upon her friend  so well understanding the gradations of rank below him  and be so blind to what rose above  as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking   Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent  and all the elegancies of mind  The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior  He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield  the younger branch of a very ancient family—and that the Eltons were nobody  The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable  being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate  to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune  from other sources  was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself  in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr  Elton had first entered not two years ago  to make his way as he could  without any alliances but in trade  or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility —But he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head  Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging  so full of courtesy and attention  as  supposing her real motive unperceived  might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy  like Mr  Elton  in fancying himself a very decided favourite  If she had so misinterpreted his feelings  she had little right to wonder that he  with self-interest to blind him  should have mistaken hers   The first error and the worst lay at her door  It was foolish  it was wrong  to take so active a part in bringing any two people together  It was adventuring too far  assuming too much  making light of what ought to be serious  a trick of what ought to be simple  She was quite concerned and ashamed  and resolved to do such things no more    said she  
 She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse  and then resumed a more serious  more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been  and might be  and must be  The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet  and all that poor Harriet would be suffering  with the awkwardness of future meetings  the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance  of subduing feelings  concealing resentment  and avoiding eclat  were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer  and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully   To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma s  though under temporary gloom at night  the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits  The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy  and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed  they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope   Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed  more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her  and to depend on getting tolerably out of it   It was a great consolation that Mr  Elton should not be really in love with her  or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him—that Harriet s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive—and that there could be no necessity for any body s knowing what had passed except the three principals  and especially for her father s being given a moment s uneasiness about it   These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service  for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present   The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day  she could not go to church  Mr  Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it  and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas  The ground covered with snow  and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw  which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise  every morning beginning in rain or snow  and every evening setting in to freeze  she was for many days a most honourable prisoner  No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr  Elton s absenting himself   It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other  it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house  too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr  Knightley  whom no weather could keep entirely from them —   These days of confinement would have been  but for her private perplexities  remarkably comfortable  as such seclusion exactly suited her brother  whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions; and he had  besides  so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls  that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield  He was always agreeable and obliging  and speaking pleasantly of every body  But with all the hopes of cheerfulness  and all the present comfort of delay  there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet  as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease       CHAPTER XVII  Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield  The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr  Woodhouse having  as usual  tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children  was obliged to see the whole party set off  and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;—which poor Isabella  passing her life with those she doated on  full of their merits  blind to their faults  and always innocently busy  might have been a model of right feminine happiness   The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr  Elton to Mr  Woodhouse  a long  civil  ceremonious note  to say  with Mr  Elton s best compliments   Emma was most agreeably surprized —Mr  Elton s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired  She admired him for contriving it  though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced  Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father  from which she was so pointedly excluded  She had not even a share in his opening compliments —Her name was not mentioned;—and there was so striking a change in all this  and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments  as she thought  at first  could not escape her father s suspicion   It did  however —Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey  and his fears that Mr  Elton might never get safely to the end of it  and saw nothing extraordinary in his language  It was a very useful note  for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening  Mr  Woodhouse talked over his alarms  and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude   She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark  She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold  and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman s return  She went to Mrs  Goddard s accordingly the very next day  to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was —She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding—to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred—and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject  all her observations  all her convictions  all her prophecies for the last six weeks   The confession completely renewed her first shame—and the sight of Harriet s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with herself again   Harriet bore the intelligence very well—blaming nobody—and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself  as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend   Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable  all that ought to be attaching  seemed on Harriet s side  not her own  Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of  The affection of such a man as Mr  Elton would have been too great a distinction —She never could have deserved him—and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible   Her tears fell abundantly—but her grief was so truly artless  that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma s eyes—and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding—really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two—and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do   It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet  and repressing imagination all the rest of her life  Her second duty now  inferior only to her father s claims  was to promote Harriet s comfort  and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making  She got her to Hartfield  and shewed her the most unvarying kindness  striving to occupy and amuse her  and by books and conversation  to drive Mr  Elton from her thoughts   Time  she knew  must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general  and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr  Elton in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet s age  and with the entire extinction of all hope  such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr  Elton s return  as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance  without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them   Harriet did think him all perfection  and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him in person or goodness—and did  in truth  prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her so natural  so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited  that she could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force   If Mr  Elton  on his return  made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do  she could not imagine Harriet s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him   Their being fixed  so absolutely fixed  in the same place  was bad for each  for all three  Not one of them had the power of removal  or of effecting any material change of society  They must encounter each other  and make the best of it   Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs  Goddard s; Mr  Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth  Where the wound had been given  there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that  till she saw her in the way of cure  there could be no true peace for herself       CHAPTER XVIII  Mr  Frank Churchill did not come  When the time proposed drew near  Mrs  Weston s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse  For the present  he could not be spared  to his  Mrs  Weston was exceedingly disappointed—much more disappointed  in fact  than her husband  though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper  though for ever expecting more good than occurs  does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression  It soon flies over the present failure  and begins to hope again  For half an hour Mr  Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he would be able  without any doubt  to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner   These feelings rapidly restored his comfort  while Mrs  Weston  of a more apprehensive disposition  foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer  suffered a great deal more herself   Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr  Frank Churchill s not coming  except as a disappointment at Randalls  The acquaintance at present had no charm for her  She wanted  rather  to be quiet  and out of temptation; but still  as it was desirable that she should appear  in general  like her usual self  she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance  and enter as warmly into Mr  and Mrs  Weston s disappointment  as might naturally belong to their friendship   She was the first to announce it to Mr  Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary   or  being acting a part  perhaps rather more   at the conduct of the Churchills  in keeping him away  She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt  of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire  which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again  found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr  Knightley; and  to her great amusement  perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion  and making use of Mrs  Weston s arguments against herself    said Mr  Knightley  coolly; 
            said Emma  laughing; 
       cried Emma; 
      replied Mr  Knightley  rather displeased; 
     said Mr  Knightley warmly  
  cried Emma  
    To take a dislike to a young man  only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself  was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the high opinion of himself  which she had often laid to his charge  she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another       VOLUME II      CHAPTER I  Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning  and  in Emma s opinion  had been talking enough of Mr  Elton for that day  She could not think that Harriet s solace or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;—but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded  and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter  and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive— They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs  and Miss Bates  She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers  There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs  and Miss Bates loved to be called on  and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her  as rather negligent in that respect  and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts   She had had many a hint from Mr  Knightley and some from her own heart  as to her deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable —a waste of time—tiresome women—and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of Highbury  who were calling on them for ever  and therefore she seldom went near them  But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in—observing  as she proposed it to Harriet  that  as well as she could calculate  they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax   The house belonged to people in business  Mrs  and Miss Bates occupied the drawing-room floor; and there  in the very moderate-sized apartment  which was every thing to them  the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady  who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner  wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse  and her more active  talking daughter  almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness  thanks for their visit  solicitude for their shoes  anxious inquiries after Mr  Woodhouse s health  cheerful communications about her mother s  and sweet-cake from the beaufet— The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr  Elton  There was intimacy between them  and Mr  Cole had heard from Mr  Elton since his going away  Emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again  and settle how long he had been gone  and how much he was engaged in company  and what a favourite he was wherever he went  and how full the Master of the Ceremonies  ball had been; and she went through it very well  with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite  and always putting forward to prevent Harriet s being obliged to say a word   This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant  having once talked him handsomely over  to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic  and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury  and their card-parties  She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr  Elton; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates  she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles  to usher in a letter from her niece    Emma s politeness was at hand directly  to say  with smiling interest—    replied the happily deceived aunt  while eagerly hunting for the letter —
 All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax s handwriting    replied Miss Bates  highly gratified; 
 addressing her  
 And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it  She was pondering  in the meanwhile  upon the possibility  without seeming very rude  of making her escape from Jane Fairfax s letter  and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse  when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention          At this moment  an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax  this charming Mr  Dixon  and the not going to Ireland  she said  with the insidious design of farther discovery              said Emma  glancing at Harriet  and beginning to rise—
 And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded  She regained the street—happy in this  that though much had been forced on her against her will  though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax s letter  she had been able to escape the letter itself       CHAPTER II  Jane Fairfax was an orphan  the only child of Mrs  Bates s youngest daughter   The marriage of Lieut  Fairfax of the ——regiment of infantry  and Miss Jane Bates  had had its day of fame and pleasure  hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it  save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad—of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards—and this girl   By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old  on losing her mother  she became the property  the charge  the consolation  the foundling of her grandmother and aunt  there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught only what very limited means could command  and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement  to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person  good understanding  and warm-hearted  well-meaning relations   But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny  This was Colonel Campbell  who had very highly regarded Fairfax  as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther  had been indebted to him for such attentions  during a severe camp-fever  as he believed had saved his life  These were claims which he did not learn to overlook  though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax  before his own return to England put any thing in his power  When he did return  he sought out the child and took notice of her  He was a married man  with only one living child  a girl  about Jane s age: and Jane became their guest  paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old  his daughter s great fondness for her  and his own wish of being a real friend  united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education  It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell s family  and had lived with them entirely  only visiting her grandmother from time to time   The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible  To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell s power; for though his income  by pay and appointments  was handsome  his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter s; but  by giving her an education  he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter   Such was Jane Fairfax s history  She had fallen into good hands  known nothing but kindness from the Campbells  and been given an excellent education  Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people  her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell s residence being in London  every lighter talent had been done full justice to  by the attendance of first-rate masters  Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was  as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children  fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too much beloved to be parted with  Neither father nor mother could promote  and the daughter could not endure it  The evil day was put off  It was easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with them  sharing  as another daughter  in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society  and a judicious mixture of home and amusement  with only the drawback of the future  the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over   The affection of the whole family  the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular  was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements  That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman  nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents  They continued together with unabated regard however  till the marriage of Miss Campbell  who by that chance  that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs  giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior  engaged the affections of Mr  Dixon  a young man  rich and agreeable  almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled  while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn   This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning  She had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period  With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate  she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice  and retire from all the pleasures of life  of rational intercourse  equal society  peace and hope  to penance and mortification for ever   The good sense of Colonel and Mrs  Campbell could not oppose such a resolution  though their feelings did  As long as they lived  no exertions would be necessary  their home might be hers for ever; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would be selfishness:—what must be at last  had better be soon  Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay  and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished  Still  however  affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment  She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter s marriage; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength  they must forbid her engaging in duties  which  so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits  seemed  under the most favourable circumstances  to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort   With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland  her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth  though there might be some truths not told  It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend  perhaps  her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells  whatever might be their motive or motives  whether single  or double  or treble  gave the arrangement their ready sanction  and said  that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air  for the recovery of her health  than on any thing else  Certain it was that she was to come; and that Highbury  instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it—Mr  Frank Churchill—must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax  who could bring only the freshness of a two years  absence   Emma was sorry;—to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months!—to be always doing more than she wished  and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr  Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman  which she wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time  there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her  But  It was a dislike so little just—every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy  that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence  without feeling that she had injured her; and now  when the due visit was paid  on her arrival  after a two years  interval  she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners  which for those two whole years she had been depreciating  Jane Fairfax was very elegant  remarkably elegant; and she had herself the highest value for elegance  Her height was pretty  just such as almost every body would think tall  and nobody could think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium  between fat and thin  though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two  Emma could not but feel all this; and then  her face—her features—there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered; it was not regular  but it was very pleasing beauty  Her eyes  a deep grey  with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows  had never been denied their praise; but the skin  which she had been used to cavil at  as wanting colour  had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom  It was a style of beauty  of which elegance was the reigning character  and as such  she must  in honour  by all her principles  admire it:—elegance  which  whether of person or of mind  she saw so little in Highbury  There  not to be vulgar  was distinction  and merit   In short  she sat  during the first visit  looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice  and was determining that she would dislike her no longer  When she took in her history  indeed  her situation  as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to  what she was going to sink from  how she was going to live  it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially  if to every well-known particular entitling her to interest  were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr  Dixon  which she had so naturally started to herself  In that case  nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on  Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr  Dixon s actions from his wife  or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first  If it were love  it might be simple  single  successless love on her side alone  She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison  while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best  the purest of motives  might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland  and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty   Upon the whole  Emma left her with such softened  charitable feelings  as made her look around in walking home  and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her   These were charming feelings—but not lasting  Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax  or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors  than saying to Mr  Knightley   If any thing could be more  where all was most  she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing  She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr  Dixon s character  or her own value for his company  or opinion of the suitableness of the match  It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished  It did her no service however  Her caution was thrown away  Emma saw its artifice  and returned to her first surmises  There probably was something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr  Dixon  perhaps  had been very near changing one friend for the other  or been fixed only to Miss Campbell  for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds   The like reserve prevailed on other topics  She and Mr  Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time  It was known that they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was  —

     CHAPTER III  Emma could not forgive her;—but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr  Knightley  who had been of the party  and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side  he was expressing the next morning  being at Hartfield again on business with Mr  Woodhouse  his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room  but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma  He had been used to think her unjust to Jane  and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement    he began  as soon as Mr  Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary  told that he understood  and the papers swept away;—
  said Emma  smiling; 
  said her father instantly; 
  said Mr  Knightley  nearly at the same time; 
 An arch look expressed— but she said only  
    said he  moving from his chair into one close by her  
    said Mr  Woodhouse  in his quiet way  
  Emma saw his anxiety  and wishing to appease it  at least for the present  said  and with a sincerity which no one could question—   Mr  Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express; and before he could make any reply  Mr  Woodhouse  whose thoughts were on the Bates s  said—      said Mr  Knightley presently  
  He had time only to say     Emma had not had time even to think of Mr  Elton  and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start  and a little blush  at the sound     cried Miss Bates  
    replied Mr  Woodhouse—
  — Here was a sly glance at Emma  
  said Emma  as soon as she could speak  
  was Mr  Woodhouse s observation  
  said Miss Bates  joyfully; 
 Jane s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her    she replied  starting on this appeal; 
  cried Emma  
  turning to Mr  Woodhouse  
  said Emma  
 Nobody had any information to give; and  after a few more wonderings  Emma said     replied Jane  
  said Miss Bates  
       Emma  alone with her father  had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry—and to marry strangers too—and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject  It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news  as proving that Mr  Elton could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it—and all that she could hope was  by giving the first information herself  to save her from hearing it abruptly from others  It was now about the time that she was likely to call  If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!—and upon its beginning to rain  Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs  Goddard s  and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation   The shower was heavy  but short; and it had not been over five minutes  when in came Harriet  with just the heated  agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the  which instantly burst forth  had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation  As the blow was given  Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening; and Harriet  unchecked  ran eagerly through what she had to tell  
—Ford s was the principal woollen-draper  linen-draper  and haberdasher s shop united; the shop first in size and fashion in the place —
 Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her power  She was obliged to stop and think  She was not thoroughly comfortable herself  The young man s conduct  and his sister s  seemed the result of real feeling  and she could not but pity them  As Harriet described it  there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour  But she had believed them to be well-meaning  worthy people before; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion  It was folly to be disturbed by it  Of course  he must be sorry to lose her—they must be all sorry  Ambition  as well as love  had probably been mortified  They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet s acquaintance: and besides  what was the value of Harriet s description —So easily pleased—so little discerning;—what signified her praise   She exerted herself  and did try to make her comfortable  by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle  and quite unworthy of being dwelt on    said she; 
 Harriet said   and she 
 Mr  Elton s rights  however  gradually revived  Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before  or an hour before  its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation was over  she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity  wonder and regret  pain and pleasure  as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins  which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy   Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting  It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock  without retaining any influence to alarm  As Harriet now lived  the Martins could not get at her  without seeking her  where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the brother  the sisters never had been at Mrs  Goddard s; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again  with any necessity  or even any power of speech       CHAPTER IV  Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations  that a young person  who either marries or dies  is sure of being kindly spoken of   A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins s name was first mentioned in Highbury  before she was  by some means or other  discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome  elegant  highly accomplished  and perfectly amiable: and when Mr  Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects  and circulate the fame of her merits  there was very little more for him to do  than to tell her Christian name  and say whose music she principally played   Mr  Elton returned  a very happy man  He had gone away rejected and mortified—disappointed in a very sanguine hope  after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right lady  but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one  He had gone away deeply offended—he came back engaged to another—and to another as superior  of course  to the first  as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost  He came back gay and self-satisfied  eager and busy  caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse  and defying Miss Smith   The charming Augusta Hawkins  in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit  was in possession of an independent fortune  of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some dignity  as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had not thrown himself away—he had gained a woman of 10 000 l  or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity—the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs  Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious—the steps so quick  from the accidental rencontre  to the dinner at Mr  Green s  and the party at Mrs  Brown s—smiles and blushes rising in importance—with consciousness and agitation richly scattered—the lady had been so easily impressed—so sweetly disposed—had in short  to use a most intelligible phrase  been so very ready to have him  that vanity and prudence were equally contented   He had caught both substance and shadow—both fortune and affection  and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and his own concerns—expecting to be congratulated—ready to be laughed at—and  with cordial  fearless smiles  now addressing all the young ladies of the place  to whom  a few weeks ago  he would have been more cautiously gallant   The wedding was no distant event  as the parties had only themselves to please  and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and when he set out for Bath again  there was a general expectation  which a certain glance of Mrs  Cole s did not seem to contradict  that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride   During his present short stay  Emma had barely seen him; but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over  and to give her the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension  now spread over his air  She was  in fact  beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings  that  except in a moral light  as a penance  a lesson  a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind  she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again  She wished him very well; but he gave her pain  and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction   The pain of his continued residence in Highbury  however  must certainly be lessened by his marriage  Many vain solicitudes would be prevented—many awkwardnesses smoothed by it  A Mrs  Elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark  It would be almost beginning their life of civility again   Of the lady  individually  Emma thought very little  She was good enough for Mr  Elton  no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury—handsome enough—to look plain  probably  by Harriet s side  As to connexion  there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded  that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet  he had done nothing  On that article  truth seemed attainable  What she was  must be uncertain; but who she was  might be found out; and setting aside the 10 000 l   it did not appear that she was at all Harriet s superior  She brought no name  no blood  no alliance  Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol—merchant  of course  he must be called; but  as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate  it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also  Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her home  the very heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years ago  an uncle remained—in the law line—nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him  than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived  Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney  and too stupid to rise  And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister  who was very well married  to a gentleman in a great way  near Bristol  who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins   Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had talked her into love; but  alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it  The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet s mind was not to be talked away  He might be superseded by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else  she feared  would cure her  Harriet was one of those  who  having once begun  would be always in love  And now  poor girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr  Elton  She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other  Emma saw him only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure just to meet with him  or just to miss him  just to hear his voice  or see his shoulder  just to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy  in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture  She was  moreover  perpetually hearing about him; for  excepting when at Hartfield  she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr  Elton  and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns; and every report  therefore  every guess—all that had already occurred  all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs  comprehending income  servants  and furniture  was continually in agitation around her  Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him  and her regrets kept alive  and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins s happiness  and continual observation of  how much he seemed attached!—his air as he walked by the house—the very sitting of his hat  being all in proof of how much he was in love!  Had it been allowable entertainment  had there been no pain to her friend  or reproach to herself  in the waverings of Harriet s mind  Emma would have been amused by its variations  Sometimes Mr  Elton predominated  sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other  Mr  Elton s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr  Martin  The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin s calling at Mrs  Goddard s a few days afterwards  Harriet had not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her  written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach  with a great deal of kindness; and till Mr  Elton himself appeared  she had been much occupied by it  continually pondering over what could be done in return  and wishing to do more than she dared to confess  But Mr  Elton  in person  had driven away all such cares  While he staid  the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again  Emma  to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned  judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin s visit   How that visit was to be acknowledged—what would be necessary—and what might be safest  had been a point of some doubtful consideration  Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters  when invited to come  would be ingratitude  It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance—!  After much thinking  she could determine on nothing better  than Harriet s returning the visit; but in a way that  if they had understanding  should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance  She meant to take her in the carriage  leave her at the Abbey Mill  while she drove a little farther  and call for her again so soon  as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past  and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future   She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve—something of ingratitude  merely glossed over—it must be done  or what would become of Harriet       CHAPTER V  Small heart had Harriet for visiting  Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs  Goddard s  her evil stars had led her to the very spot where  at that moment  a trunk  directed to The Rev  Philip Elton  White-Hart  Bath  was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher s cart  which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world  excepting that trunk and the direction  was consequently a blank   She went  however; and when they reached the farm  and she was to be put down  at the end of the broad  neat gravel walk  which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door  the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before  was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted  Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity  which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour  She went on herself  to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married  and settled in Donwell   The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again; and Miss Smith receiving her summons  was with her without delay  and unattended by any alarming young man  She came solitarily down the gravel walk—a Miss Martin just appearing at the door  and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility   Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account  She was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting  and the sort of pain it was creating  She had seen only Mrs  Martin and the two girls  They had received her doubtingly  if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time—till just at last  when Mrs  Martin s saying  all of a sudden  that she thought Miss Smith was grown  had brought on a more interesting subject  and a warmer manner  In that very room she had been measured last September  with her two friends  There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window  He had done it  They all seemed to remember the day  the hour  the party  the occasion—to feel the same consciousness  the same regrets—to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they were just growing again like themselves   Harriet  as Emma must suspect  as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy   when the carriage reappeared  and all was over  The style of the visit  and the shortness of it  were then felt to be decisive  Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!—Emma could not but picture it all  and feel how justly they might resent  how naturally Harriet must suffer  It was a bad business  She would have given a great deal  or endured a great deal  to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life  They were so deserving  that a little higher should have been enough: but as it was  how could she have done otherwise —Impossible!—She could not repent  They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process—so much to herself at this time  that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation  and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it  Her mind was quite sick of Mr  Elton and the Martins  The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary   It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither   cried Emma  as they turned away  
  There was no resisting such news  no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr  Weston s  confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife  fewer and quieter  but not less to the purpose  To know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so  and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy  It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits  The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment s thought  she hoped Mr  Elton would now be talked of no more   Mr  Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe  which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command  as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened  and smiled  and congratulated    Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech  from his wife    said she  
 —and turning again to Emma  
 Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent  and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing      But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once  and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time   The morning of the interesting day arrived  and Mrs  Weston s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten  or eleven  or twelve o clock  that she was to think of her at four   —said she  in mental soliloquy  while walking downstairs from her own room  
 The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall  
 She opened the parlour door  and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father—Mr  Weston and his son  They had been arrived only a few minutes  and Mr  Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank s being a day before his time  and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations  when she appeared  to have her share of surprize  introduction  and pleasure   The Frank Churchill so long talked of  so high in interest  was actually before her—he was presented to her  and she did not think too much had been said in his praise; he was a very good looking young man; height  air  address  all were unexceptionable  and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father s; he looked quick and sensible  She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner  and a readiness to talk  which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her  and that acquainted they soon must be   He had reached Randalls the evening before  She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan  and travel earlier  later  and quicker  that he might gain half a day    cried Mr  Weston with exultation  
  said the young man  
 The word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency  Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed  He was very much pleased with Randalls  thought it a most admirably arranged house  would hardly allow it even to be very small  admired the situation  the walk to Highbury  Highbury itself  Hartfield still more  and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one s own country gives  and the greatest curiosity to visit it  That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before  passed suspiciously through Emma s brain; but still  if it were a falsehood  it was a pleasant one  and pleasantly handled  His manner had no air of study or exaggeration  He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment   Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance  On his side were the inquiries — But when satisfied on all these points  and their acquaintance proportionably advanced  he contrived to find an opportunity  while their two fathers were engaged with each other  of introducing his mother-in-law  and speaking of her with so much handsome praise  so much warm admiration  so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father  and her very kind reception of himself  as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please—and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her  He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs  Weston; but  undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter  He understood what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else   he said  
 He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor s merits  without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse s character  than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor s  And at last  as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object  he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person    said he; 
  said Emma; 
  he replied; 
 Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other  which had taken strong possession of her mind  had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence  or proofs of defiance  She must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were agreeable   She had no doubt of what Mr  Weston was often thinking about  His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression; and even  when he might have determined not to look  she was confident that he was often listening   Her own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind  the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion  was a most comfortable circumstance  Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it —Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged  he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons  understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them  She blessed the favouring blindness  He could now  without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise  without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest  give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr  Frank Churchill s accommodation on his journey  through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road  and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold—which  however  he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night   A reasonable visit paid  Mr  Weston began to move —   cried his father; 
  said the young man; 
  The son looked convinced    said Emma; 
 He agreed to it  but with so quiet a   said she  
  said Mr  Woodhouse  always the last to make his way in conversation; 
   Mr  Frank Churchill still declined it  looking as serious as he could  and his father gave his hearty support by calling out   They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one  and a graceful bow from the other  the two gentlemen took leave  Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance  and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day  with full confidence in their comfort       CHAPTER VI  The next morning brought Mr  Frank Churchill again  He came with Mrs  Weston  to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially  He had been sitting with her  it appeared  most companionably at home  till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk  immediately fixed on Highbury — Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr  Weston  who had called in for half a minute  in order to hear that his son was very handsome  knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her  therefore  to perceive them walking up to the house together  arm in arm  She was wanting to see him again  and especially to see him in company with Mrs  Weston  upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend  If he were deficient there  nothing should make amends for it  But on seeing them together  she became perfectly satisfied  It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her—nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection  And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment  as their visit included all the rest of the morning  They were all three walking about together for an hour or two—first round the shrubberies of Hartfield  and afterwards in Highbury  He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr  Woodhouse s ear; and when their going farther was resolved on  confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village  and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed   Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings  He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long  and which had been the home of his father s father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him was still living  walked in quest of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit  they shewed  altogether  a good-will towards Highbury in general  which must be very like a merit to those he was with   Emma watched and decided  that with such feelings as were now shewn  it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part  or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr  Knightley certainly had not done him justice   Their first pause was at the Crown Inn  an inconsiderable house  though the principal one of the sort  where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept  more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a ball-room  and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous  dancing state  had been occasionally used as such;—but such brilliant days had long passed away  and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place  He was immediately interested  Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of passing on  he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open  to look in and contemplate its capabilities  and lament that its original purpose should have ceased  He saw no fault in the room  he would acknowledge none which they suggested  No  it was long enough  broad enough  handsome enough  It would hold the very number for comfort  They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter  Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room —She who could do any thing in Highbury! The want of proper families in the place  and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend  were mentioned; but he was not satisfied  He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him  could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described  he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing  or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body s returning into their proper place the next morning  He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills  He seemed to have all the life and spirit  cheerful feelings  and social inclinations of his father  and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe  Of pride  indeed  there was  perhaps  scarcely enough; his indifference to a confusion of rank  bordered too much on inelegance of mind  He could be no judge  however  of the evil he was holding cheap  It was but an effusion of lively spirits   At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged  Emma recollected his intended visit the day before  and asked him if he had paid it   —he replied; 
   Emma would not agree to this  and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax s complexion    said Emma  
 He shook his head and laughed —  At this moment they were approaching Ford s  and he hastily exclaimed    They went in; and while the sleek  well-tied parcels of  and 
 were bringing down and displaying on the counter  he said—
        said Mrs  Weston smiling; 
  said Emma  
 He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment   When the gloves were bought  and they had quitted the shop again    repeated Emma  
   said Emma  highly amused —
     said Emma  laughing  
      he began rather quickly  but checking himself  added  
   said he  
  He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long  and thinking so much alike  Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him  that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting  He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some of his notions  less of the spoiled child of fortune  therefore better than she had expected  His ideas seemed more moderate—his feelings warmer  She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr  Elton s house  which  as well as the church  he would go and look at  and would not join them in finding much fault with  No  he could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having  If it were to be shared with the woman he loved  he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house  There must be ample room in it for every real comfort  The man must be a blockhead who wanted more   Mrs  Weston laughed  and said he did not know what he was talking about  Used only to a large house himself  and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size  he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one  But Emma  in her own mind  determined that he did know what he was talking about  and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life  and to marry  from worthy motives  He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper s room  or a bad butler s pantry  but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him happy  and that whenever he were attached  he would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment       CHAPTER VII  Emma s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day  by hearing that he was gone off to London  merely to have his hair cut  A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast  and he had sent for a chaise and set off  intending to return to dinner  but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut  There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve  It did not accord with the rationality of plan  the moderation in expense  or even the unselfish warmth of heart  which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday  Vanity  extravagance  love of change  restlessness of temper  which must be doing something  good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs  Weston  indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges  His father only called him a coxcomb  and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs  Weston did not like it  was clear enough  by her passing it over as quickly as possible  and making no other comment than that  With the exception of this little blot  Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him  Mrs  Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself—how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether  He appeared to have a very open temper—certainly a very cheerful and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions  a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard  was fond of talking of him—said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt  he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude  and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect  This was all very promising; and  but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut  there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him; the honour  if not of being really in love with her  of being at least very near it  and saved only by her own indifference— for still her resolution held of never marrying —the honour  in short  of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance   Mr  Weston  on his side  added a virtue to the account which must have some weight  He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely—thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him altogether  she found she must not judge him harshly  As Mrs  Weston observed   There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry  not so leniently disposed  In general he was judged  throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury  with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man—one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened  from its power of censure  by bows or smiles—Mr  Knightley  The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment  he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself  over a newspaper he held in his hand   Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings  Mr  and Mrs  Weston s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune  Something occurred while they were at Hartfield  to make Emma want their advice; and  which was still more lucky  she wanted exactly the advice they gave   This was the occurrence:—The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury  and were very good sort of people—friendly  liberal  and unpretending; but  on the other hand  they were of low origin  in trade  and only moderately genteel  On their first coming into the country  they had lived in proportion to their income  quietly  keeping little company  and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means—the house in town had yielded greater profits  and fortune in general had smiled on them  With their wealth  their views increased; their want of a larger house  their inclination for more company  They added to their house  to their number of servants  to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were  in fortune and style of living  second only to the family at Hartfield  Their love of society  and their new dining-room  prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties  chiefly among the single men  had already taken place  The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite—neither Donwell  nor Hartfield  nor Randalls  Nothing should tempt her to go  if they did; and she regretted that her father s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish  The Coles were very respectable in their way  but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them  This lesson  she very much feared  they would receive only from herself; she had little hope of Mr  Knightley  none of Mr  Weston   But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared  that when the insult came at last  it found her very differently affected  Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation  and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs  Weston s accounting for it with  It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield  which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark  on reading it  was that  She owned that  considering every thing  she was not absolutely without inclination for the party  The Coles expressed themselves so properly—there was so much real attention in the manner of it—so much consideration for her father    said he—
 Then turning to Mrs  Weston  with a look of gentle reproach—
  cried Mr  Weston  
 But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment  was increasing  not lessening  Mr  Woodhouse s agitation  The ladies knew better how to allay it  Mr  Weston must be quiet  and every thing deliberately arranged   With this treatment  Mr  Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual       cried Mr  Weston  
  said Mr  Woodhouse  
    He did  on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that  if she came home cold  she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry  that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house  as usual       CHAPTER VIII  Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father s dinner waiting  it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs  Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr  Woodhouse  to betray any imperfection which could be concealed   He came back  had had his hair cut  and laughed at himself with a very good grace  but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done  He had no reason to wish his hair longer  to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent  to improve his spirits  He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and  after seeing him  Emma thus moralised to herself:—   With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again  and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners  and by inference  of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be  who were now seeing them together for the first time   She meant to be very happy  in spite of the scene being laid at Mr  Cole s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr  Elton  even in the days of his favour  none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr  Cole   Her father s comfort was amply secured  Mrs  Bates as well as Mrs  Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty  before she left the house  was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress  to make the two ladies all the amends in her power  by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine  for whatever unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal —She had provided a plentiful dinner for them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it   She followed another carriage to Mr  Cole s door; and was pleased to see that it was Mr  Knightley s; for Mr  Knightley keeping no horses  having little spare money and a great deal of health  activity  and independence  was too apt  in Emma s opinion  to get about as he could  and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey  She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart  for he stopped to hand her out    said she; 
 He thanked her  observing     Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr  Knightley  She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please  and given all the consequence she could wish for  When the Westons arrived  the kindest looks of love  the strongest of admiration were for her  from both husband and wife; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object  and at dinner she found him seated by her—and  as she firmly believed  not without some dexterity on his side   The party was rather large  as it included one other family  a proper unobjectionable country family  whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance  and the male part of Mr  Cox s family  the lawyer of Highbury  The less worthy females were to come in the evening  with Miss Bates  Miss Fairfax  and Miss Smith; but already  at dinner  they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and  while politics and Mr  Elton were talked over  Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour  The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend  was the name of Jane Fairfax  Mrs  Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting  She listened  and found it well worth listening to  That very dear part of Emma  her fancy  received an amusing supply  Mrs  Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates  and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte—a very elegant looking instrument—not a grand  but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story  the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize  and inquiry  and congratulations on her side  and explanations on Miss Bates s  was  that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood s the day before  to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece—entirely unexpected; that at first  by Miss Bates s account  Jane herself was quite at a loss  quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it—but now  they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;—of course it must be from Colonel Campbell    added Mrs  Cole  
 Mrs  Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell  and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way  and still listen to Mrs  Cole    Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs  Cole s  turned to Frank Churchill                       The conversation was here interrupted  They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses  and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table was again safely covered  when every corner dish was placed exactly right  and occupation and ease were generally restored  Emma said       There was no occasion to press the matter farther  The conviction seemed real; he looked as if he felt it  She said no more  other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded  the children came in  and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said  a few downright silly  but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other—nothing worse than everyday remarks  dull repetitions  old news  and heavy jokes   The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room  before the other ladies  in their different divisions  arrived  Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace  she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner  but could most heartily rejoice in that light  cheerful  unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure  in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection  There she sat—and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding  To be in company  nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed  to sit and smile and look pretty  and say nothing  was enough for the happiness of the present hour  Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet  very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved—yes  of having loved even Mr  Elton in vain—by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend   In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her  She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte  she felt too much in the secret herself  to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair  and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others  the subject was almost immediately introduced  and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received  the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of  Mrs  Weston  kind-hearted and musical  was particularly interested by the circumstance  and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone  touch  and pedal  totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible  which she plainly read in the fair heroine s countenance   They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill  In he walked  the first and the handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece  made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle  where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her  would not sit at all  Emma divined what every body present must be thinking  She was his object  and every body must perceive it  She introduced him to her friend  Miss Smith  and  at convenient moments afterwards  heard what each thought of the other   And she  
 Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech  He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room—hated sitting long—was always the first to move when he could—that his father  Mr  Knightley  Mr  Cox  and Mr  Cole  were left very busy over parish business—that as long as he had staid  however  it had been pleasant enough  as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike  sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether—thought it so abundant in agreeable families—that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much  She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire—the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe  and the sort; and could make out from his answers that  as far as Enscombe was concerned  there was very little going on  that their visitings were among a range of great families  none very near; and that even when days were fixed  and invitations accepted  it was an even chance that Mrs  Churchill were not in health and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that  though he had his separate engagements  it was not without difficulty  without considerable address at times  that he could get away  or introduce an acquaintance for a night   She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy  and that Highbury  taken at its best  might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked  His importance at Enscombe was very evident  He did not boast  but it naturally betrayed itself  that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing  and on her laughing and noticing it  he owned that he believed  excepting one or two points  he could with time persuade her to any thing  One of those points on which his influence failed  he then mentioned  He had wanted very much to go abroad—had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel—but she would not hear of it  This had happened the year before  Now  he said  he was beginning to have no longer the same wish   The unpersuadable point  which he did not mention  Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father    said he  after a short pause — 
   said he  smiling  
 The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room  Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes  and listen to Mr  Cole  When Mr  Cole had moved away  and her attention could be restored as before  she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax  who was sitting exactly opposite    He started   he replied  
 He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax  and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady  as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them  exactly in front of Miss Fairfax  she could absolutely distinguish nothing   Before he could return to his chair  it was taken by Mrs  Weston    said she:—
      said Emma—
  said Mrs  Weston  smiling  
  exclaimed Emma  
            said Mrs  Weston  laughing  
        They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs  Weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over  and the instrument in preparation;—and at the same moment Mr  Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it  Frank Churchill  of whom  in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs  Weston  she had been seeing nothing  except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax  followed Mr  Cole  to add his very pressing entreaties; and as  in every respect  it suited Emma best to lead  she gave a very proper compliance   She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable  and could accompany her own voice well  One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize—a second  slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill  Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song  and every thing usual followed  He was accused of having a delightful voice  and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter  and had no voice at all  roundly asserted  They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax  whose performance  both vocal and instrumental  she never could attempt to conceal from herself  was infinitely superior to her own   With mixed feelings  she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument  to listen  Frank Churchill sang again  They had sung together once or twice  it appeared  at Weymouth  But the sight of Mr  Knightley among the most attentive  soon drew away half Emma s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs  Weston s suspicions  to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions  Her objections to Mr  Knightley s marrying did not in the least subside  She could see nothing but evil in it  It would be a great disappointment to Mr  John Knightley; consequently to Isabella  A real injury to the children—a most mortifying change  and material loss to them all;—a very great deduction from her father s daily comfort—and  as to herself  she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey  A Mrs  Knightley for them all to give way to!—No—Mr  Knightley must never marry  Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell   Presently Mr  Knightley looked back  and came and sat down by her  They talked at first only of the performance  His admiration was certainly very warm; yet she thought  but for Mrs  Weston  it would not have struck her  As a sort of touchstone  however  she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short  she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own    said she  
  he replied;—
  said she—
  he replied  and without the smallest apparent embarrassment —
 From that moment  Emma could have taken her oath that Mr  Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument  But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment—whether there were no actual preference—remained a little longer doubtful  Towards the end of Jane s second song  her voice grew thick    said he  when it was finished  thinking aloud—
 Another song  however  was soon begged for   And Frank Churchill was heard to say  
 Mr  Knightley grew angry    said he  indignantly  
 And touching Miss Bates  who at that moment passed near—
 Miss Bates  in her real anxiety for Jane  could hardly stay even to be grateful  before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing  Here ceased the concert part of the evening  for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon  within five minutes  the proposal of dancing—originating nobody exactly knew where—was so effectually promoted by Mr  and Mrs  Cole  that every thing was rapidly clearing away  to give proper space  Mrs  Weston  capital in her country-dances  was seated  and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill  coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma  had secured her hand  and led her up to the top   While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off  Emma found time  in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste  to look about  and see what became of Mr  Knightley  This would be a trial  He was no dancer in general  If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now  it might augur something  There was no immediate appearance  No; he was talking to Mrs  Cole—he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else  and he was still talking to Mrs  Cole   Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment  Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful  and she found herself well matched in a partner  They were a couple worth looking at   Two dances  unfortunately  were all that could be allowed  It was growing late  and Miss Bates became anxious to get home  on her mother s account  After some attempts  therefore  to be permitted to begin again  they were obliged to thank Mrs  Weston  look sorrowful  and have done    said Frank Churchill  as he attended Emma to her carriage  
     CHAPTER IX  Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles  The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion  must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity  She must have delighted the Coles—worthy people  who deserved to be made happy!—And left a name behind her that would not soon die away   Perfect happiness  even in memory  is not common; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy  She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman  in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax s feelings to Frank Churchill  It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea  that it would escape her  and his submission to all that she told  was a compliment to her penetration  which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue   The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there she had no doubt  She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing  She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood—and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half   She was then interrupted by Harriet s coming in; and if Harriet s praise could have satisfied her  she might soon have been comforted            said Harriet rather hesitatingly; 
 Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her  though fearful of its producing Mr  Elton           Harriet had business at Ford s —Emma thought it most prudent to go with her  Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible  and in her present state  would be dangerous   Harriet  tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word  was always very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind  Emma went to the door for amusement —Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;—Mr  Perry walking hastily by  Mr  William Cox letting himself in at the office-door  Mr  Cole s carriage-horses returning from exercise  or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule  were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray  a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket  two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone  and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread  she knew she had no reason to complain  and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door  A mind lively and at ease  can do with seeing nothing  and can see nothing that does not answer   She looked down the Randalls road  The scene enlarged; two persons appeared; Mrs  Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into Highbury;—to Hartfield of course  They were stopping  however  in the first place at Mrs  Bates s; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford s; and had all but knocked  when Emma caught their eye —Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting  Mrs  Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses  in order to hear the new instrument    said she  
  said Frank Churchill  
 Mrs  Weston was disappointed      said Emma; 
   replied Emma —
  said Mrs  Weston  
 He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him  returned with Mrs  Weston to Mrs  Bates s door  Emma watched them in  and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter —trying  with all the force of her own mind  to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon  be it ever so beautiful  would still never match her yellow pattern  At last it was all settled  even to the destination of the parcel    asked Mrs  Ford —
       said Harriet  quite satisfied  
 Voices approached the shop—or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs  Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door    said the latter  
   Emma would be    Emma wondered on what  of all the medley  she would fix    Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to  pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will        CHAPTER X  The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered  was tranquillity itself; Mrs  Bates  deprived of her usual employment  slumbering on one side of the fire  Frank Churchill  at a table near her  most deedily occupied about her spectacles  and Jane Fairfax  standing with her back to them  intent on her pianoforte   Busy as he was  however  the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again    said he  in rather a low voice  
  said Mrs  Weston  
  he replied  
 He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her  and trying to make her help or advise him in his work  till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again  That she was not immediately ready  Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not but pity such feelings  whatever their origin  and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again   At last Jane began  and though the first bars were feebly given  the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to  Mrs  Weston had been delighted before  and was delighted again; Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte  with every proper discrimination  was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise    said Frank Churchill  with a smile at Emma  
 Jane did not look round  She was not obliged to hear  Mrs  Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment    said Emma  in a whisper; 
 He shook his head with a smile  and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy  Soon afterwards he began again    He paused  She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering    said she  in a voice of forced calmness  
  He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a little from the latter  he went to the pianoforte  and begged Miss Fairfax  who was still sitting at it  to play something more    said he  
 She played    She looked up at him for a moment  coloured deeply  and played something else  He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte  and turning to Emma  said    Emma wished he would be less pointed  yet could not help being amused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile  when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness  there had been a smile of secret delight  she had less scruple in the amusement  and much less compunction with respect to her —This amiable  upright  perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings   He brought all the music to her  and they looked it over together —Emma took the opportunity of whispering         Shortly afterwards Miss Bates  passing near the window  descried Mr  Knightley on horse-back not far off    She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke  and opening the casement there  immediately called Mr  Knightley s attention  and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others  as if it had passed within the same apartment    So began Miss Bates; and Mr  Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn  for most resolutely and commandingly did he say    And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else  The listeners were amused; and Mrs  Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning  But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism    He cut her short with        said he  in a deliberating manner  
           said Jane  
  Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches  so much of the morning was perceived to be gone  that Mrs  Weston and her companion taking leave also  could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates  before they set off for Randalls       CHAPTER XI  It may be possible to do without dancing entirely  Instances have been known of young people passing many  many months successively  without being at any ball of any description  and no material injury accrue either to body or mind;—but when a beginning is made—when the felicities of rapid motion have once been  though slightly  felt—it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more   Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury  and longed to dance again; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr  Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls  was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject  Frank s was the first idea; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties  and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance  But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr  Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced—for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax—and even for simple dancing itself  without any of the wicked aids of vanity—to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold—and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour  in the hope of discovering  in spite of all that Mr  Weston could say of their exactly equal size  that it was a little the largest   His first proposition and request  that the dance begun at Mr  Cole s should be finished there—that the same party should be collected  and the same musician engaged  met with the readiest acquiescence  Mr  Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment  and Mrs  Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed  of reckoning up exactly who there would be  and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple    had been repeated many times over  
 But soon it came to be on one side    On another    Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her brother s  and must be invited with the rest  Somebody else believed Mrs  Gilbert would have danced the other evening  if she had been asked  A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last  Mr  Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included  and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out  it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten  and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of   The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other    said he; 
 Mrs  Weston was sorry for such a charge  She knew the importance of it  and said every thing in her power to do it away  Every door was now closed  the passage plan given up  and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank Churchill s part  that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple  was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten    said he  
 Emma demurred    he gravely replied; 
   said she  
  he replied  
 Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed  and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her; but she took the compliment  and forgave the rest  Had she intended ever to marry him  it might have been worth while to pause and consider  and try to understand the value of his preference  and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance  he was quite amiable enough   Before the middle of the next day  he was at Hartfield; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme  It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement    he almost immediately began  
    She was obliged to repeat and explain it  before it was fully comprehended; and then  being quite new  farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable     said Frank Churchill  
  said Mr  Woodhouse  rather warmly  
       interrupted Emma  
      said Frank Churchill  
 Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father  engaging to think it all over while she was gone  the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown  There were Mr  and Mrs  Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation  very busy and very happy in their different way; she  in some little distress; and he  finding every thing perfect    said she  
  said her husband  
 The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant   and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself  
 One perplexity  however  arose  which the gentlemen did not disdain  It regarded a supper-room  At the time of the ballroom s being built  suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining  was the only addition  What was to be done  This card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or  if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves  still was it not too small for any comfortable supper  Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house  and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it  This made a difficulty  Mrs  Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper   Mrs  Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches  &c   set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion  A private dance  without sitting down to supper  was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs  Weston must not speak of it again  She then took another line of expediency  and looking into the doubtful room  observed    And Mr  Weston at the same time  walking briskly with long steps through the passage  was calling out     said Mrs  Weston  
  cried Frank  
  said Mrs  Weston rather hesitating  
  said Emma  
  Here Mr  Weston joined them  and on hearing what was proposed  gave it his decided approbation       Long before he reappeared  attending the short  neat  brisk-moving aunt  and her elegant niece —Mrs  Weston  like a sweet-tempered woman and a good wife  had examined the passage again  and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before—indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision  All the rest  in speculation at least  was perfectly smooth  All the minor arrangements of table and chair  lights and music  tea and supper  made themselves; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs  Weston and Mrs  Stokes —Every body invited  was certainly to come; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight  which could not possibly be refused  And a delightful dance it was to be   Most cordially  when Miss Bates arrived  did she agree that it must  As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver   a much safer character   she was truly welcome  Her approbation  at once general and minute  warm and incessant  could not but please; and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro  between the different rooms  some suggesting  some attending  and all in happy enjoyment of the future  The party did not break up without Emma s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening  nor without her overhearing Mr  Weston whisper to his wife       CHAPTER XII  One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma—its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill s stay in Surry; for  in spite of Mr  Weston s confidence  she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight  But this was not judged feasible  The preparations must take their time  nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on  and for a few days they must be planning  proceeding and hoping in uncertainty—at the risk—in her opinion  the great risk  of its being all in vain   Enscombe however was gracious  gracious in fact  if not in word  His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed  All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another  Emma  being now certain of her ball  began to adopt as the next vexation Mr  Knightley s provoking indifference about it  Either because he did not dance himself  or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted  he seemed resolved that it should not interest him  determined against its exciting any present curiosity  or affording him any future amusement  To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply  than    This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry  It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent  or so indignant; he was not guided by her feelings in reprobating the ball  for she enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree  It made her animated—open hearted—she voluntarily said;—   It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins  No!—she was more and more convinced that Mrs  Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise  There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side—but no love   Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr  Knightley  Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing  A letter arrived from Mr  Churchill to urge his nephew s instant return  Mrs  Churchill was unwell—far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering state  so said her husband  when writing to her nephew two days before  though from her usual unwillingness to give pain  and constant habit of never thinking of herself  she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle  and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay   The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma  in a note from Mrs  Weston  instantly  As to his going  it was inevitable  He must be gone within a few hours  though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt  to lessen his repugnance  He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but for her own convenience   Mrs  Weston added   This wretched note was the finale of Emma s breakfast  When once it had been read  there was no doing any thing  but lament and exclaim  The loss of the ball—the loss of the young man—and all that the young man might be feeling!—It was too wretched!—Such a delightful evening as it would have been!—Every body so happy! and she and her partner the happiest!— Her father s feelings were quite distinct  He thought principally of Mrs  Churchill s illness  and wanted to know how she was treated; and as for the ball  it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they would all be safer at home   Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience  his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him  He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it  His dejection was most evident  He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing himself  it was only to say     said Emma  
      Emma looked graciously    he continued; 
  said Emma  laughing  
 He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment  Emma was convinced that it had been so       He hesitated  got up  walked to a window    said he  
 He looked at her  as if wanting to read her thoughts  She hardly knew what to say  It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious  which she did not wish  Forcing herself to speak  therefore  in the hope of putting it by  she calmly said    He was silent  She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting on what she had said  and trying to understand the manner  She heard him sigh  It was natural for him to feel that he had cause to sigh  He could not believe her to be encouraging him  A few awkward moments passed  and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said    He stopt again  rose again  and seemed quite embarrassed —He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended  if his father had not made his appearance  Mr  Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed   A very few minutes more  however  completed the present trial  Mr  Weston  always alert when business was to be done  and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable  as of foreseeing any that was doubtful  said    said he; 
 A very friendly shake of the hand  a very earnest  It was a sad change  They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival  Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks—indescribable spirit; the idea  the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought  the assurance of his attentions  his liveliness  his manners! It had been a very happy fortnight  and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days  To complete every other recommendation  he had almost told her that he loved her  What strength  or what constancy of affection he might be subject to  was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration  a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion  joined to all the rest  made her think that she must be a little in love with him  in spite of every previous determination against it    said she  
 Mr  Knightley  however  shewed no triumphant happiness  He could not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had; but he said  and very steadily  that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others  and with considerable kindness added    It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax  to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet  her composure was odious  She had been particularly unwell  however  suffering from headache to a degree  which made her aunt declare  that had the ball taken place  she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health       CHAPTER XIII  Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love  Her ideas only varied as to the how much  At first  she thought it was a good deal; and afterwards  but little  She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of; and  for his sake  greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr  and Mrs  Weston; she was very often thinking of him  and quite impatient for a letter  that she might know how he was  how were his spirits  how was his aunt  and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring  But  on the other hand  she could not admit herself to be unhappy  nor  after the first morning  to be less disposed for employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and  pleasing as he was  she could yet imagine him to have faults; and farther  though thinking of him so much  and  as she sat drawing or working  forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment  fancying interesting dialogues  and inventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she refused him  Their affection was always to subside into friendship  Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part  When she became sensible of this  it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father  never to marry  a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings    said she —
 Upon the whole  she was equally contented with her view of his feelings    When his letter to Mrs  Weston arrived  Emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations  and think she had undervalued their strength  It was a long  well-written letter  giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings  expressing all the affection  gratitude  and respect which was natural and honourable  and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive  with spirit and precision  No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs  Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe  the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt  and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety —The charm of her own name was not wanting  Miss Woodhouse appeared more than once  and never without a something of pleasing connexion  either a compliment to her taste  or a remembrance of what she had said; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye  unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry  she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed  Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words— Gratifying  however  and stimulative as was the letter in the material part  its sentiments  she yet found  when it was folded up and returned to Mrs  Weston  that it had not added any lasting warmth  that she could still do without the writer  and that he must learn to do without her  Her intentions were unchanged  Her resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation and happiness  His recollection of Harriet  and the words which clothed it  the   said she —
 It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet s behalf  though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand  As Frank Churchill s arrival had succeeded Mr  Elton s engagement in the conversation of Highbury  as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first  so now upon Frank Churchill s disappearance  Mr  Elton s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form —His wedding-day was named  He would soon be among them again; Mr  Elton and his bride  There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before  Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give  Emma felt that she could not do too much for her  that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect  for ever agreed to  without being able to make their opinions the same  Harriet listened submissively  and said   Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation  Emma continued    This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest  The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse  whom she really loved extremely  made her wretched for a while  and when the violence of grief was comforted away  still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably    Such expressions  assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do  made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well  nor valued her affection so highly before    said she afterwards to herself  
     CHAPTER XIV  Mrs  Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted  curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew  and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid  to settle whether she were very pretty indeed  or only rather pretty  or not pretty at all   Emma had feelings  less of curiosity than of pride or propriety  to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a point of Harriet s going with her  that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible   She could not enter the house again  could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago  to lace up her boot  without recollecting  A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur  Compliments  charades  and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but she behaved very well  and was only rather pale and silent  The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it  that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady  and on no account to give one  beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being  She did not really like her  She would not be in a hurry to find fault  but she suspected that there was no elegance;—ease  but not elegance — She was almost sure that for a young woman  a stranger  a bride  there was too much ease  Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty; but neither feature  nor air  nor voice  nor manner  were elegant  Emma thought at least it would turn out so   As for Mr  Elton  his manners did not appear—but no  she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners  It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits  and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it  The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes  and the privilege of bashfulness  but the man had only his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr  Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married  the woman he had wanted to marry  and the woman whom he had been expected to marry  she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise  and to be as much affectedly  and as little really easy as could be    said Harriet  when they had quitted the house  and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; 
 There was a little hesitation in Emma s answer         returned Harriet  sighing again  
   said Harriet earnestly  
 When the visit was returned  Emma made up her mind  She could then see more and judge better  From Harriet s happening not to be at Hartfield  and her father s being present to engage Mr  Elton  she had a quarter of an hour of the lady s conversation to herself  and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs  Elton was a vain woman  extremely well satisfied with herself  and thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very superior  but with manners which had been formed in a bad school  pert and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people  and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant  and that her society would certainly do Mr  Elton no good   Harriet would have been a better match  If not wise or refined herself  she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins  it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit  had been the best of her own set  The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance  and his place and his carriages were the pride of him   The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove  —a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove  The grounds of Hartfield were small  but neat and pretty; and the house was modern and well-built  Mrs  Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room  the entrance  and all that she could see or imagine  
—Mr  Elton was appealed to —
  Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs  Elton  who only wanted to be talking herself    Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment  She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed  and therefore only said in reply       replied Mrs  Elton  with a most satisfied smile  
 Emma was silenced    continued Mrs  Elton; 
     It was as much as Emma could bear  without being impolite  The idea of her being indebted to Mrs  Elton for what was called an introduction—of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs  Elton s—probably some vulgar  dashing widow  who  with the help of a boarder  just made a shift to live!—The dignity of Miss Woodhouse  of Hartfield  was sunk indeed!  She restrained herself  however  from any of the reproofs she could have given  and only thanked Mrs  Elton coolly;     said Emma  smiling  
     said Emma  
  said Mrs  Elton  laughing  
 Emma  finding her so determined upon neglecting her music  had nothing more to say; and  after a moment s pause  Mrs  Elton chose another subject    said she  
 Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs  Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on     said Emma  
  Emma was quite at a loss  The tone implied some old acquaintance—and how could she possibly guess    continued Mrs  Elton; 
 Happily  it was now time to be gone  They were off; and Emma could breathe    was her immediate exclamation  
 All this ran so glibly through her thoughts  that by the time her father had arranged himself  after the bustle of the Eltons  departure  and was ready to speak  she was very tolerably capable of attending    he deliberately began  
       Emma had done  Her father was growing nervous  and could not understand her  Her mind returned to Mrs  Elton s offences  and long  very long  did they occupy her       CHAPTER XV  Emma was not required  by any subsequent discovery  to retract her ill opinion of Mrs  Elton  Her observation had been pretty correct  Such as Mrs  Elton appeared to her on this second interview  such she appeared whenever they met again —self-important  presuming  familiar  ignorant  and ill-bred  She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment  but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world  to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs  Elton s consequence only could surpass   There was no reason to suppose Mr  Elton thought at all differently from his wife  He seemed not merely happy with her  but proud  He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury  as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her new acquaintance  disposed to commend  or not in the habit of judging  following the lead of Miss Bates s good-will  or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself  were very well satisfied; so that Mrs  Elton s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do  unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse  who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being  In one respect Mrs  Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first  Her feelings altered towards Emma —Offended  probably  by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with  she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and though the effect was agreeable  the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma s dislike  Her manners  too—and Mr  Elton s  were unpleasant towards Harriet  They were sneering and negligent  Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet s cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much —It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve  and her own share in the story  under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him  had in all likelihood been given also  She was  of course  the object of their joint dislike —When they had nothing else to say  it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her  found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet   Mrs  Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first  Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other  but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration—but without solicitation  or plea  or privilege  she must be wanting to assist and befriend her —Before Emma had forfeited her confidence  and about the third time of their meeting  she heard all Mrs  Elton s knight-errantry on the subject —    was Emma s calm answer—
    —thought Emma —
 Emma had not to listen to such paradings again—to any so exclusively addressed to herself—so disgustingly decorated with a  She looked on with some amusement —Miss Bates s gratitude for Mrs  Elton s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth  She was quite one of her worthies—the most amiable  affable  delightful woman—just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs  Elton meant to be considered  Emma s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs  Elton as she seemed to do  She heard of her walking with the Eltons  sitting with the Eltons  spending a day with the Eltons! This was astonishing!—She could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer    said she —
 Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer  and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there  According to Miss Bates—it all came from her—Mrs  Dixon had written most pressingly  Would Jane but go  means were to be found  servants sent  friends contrived—no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had declined it!   was Emma s conclusion  
 Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject  before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs  Elton  Mrs  Weston ventured this apology for Jane     said Mr  Knightley warmly  
 Emma felt that Mrs  Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she was herself struck by his warmth  With a faint blush  she presently replied     said Mrs  Weston  
 Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few minutes silence  he said      he replied  
  said Emma  beginning hastily and with an arch look  but soon stopping—it was better  however  to know the worst at once—she hurried on—
 Mr  Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters  and either the exertion of getting them together  or some other cause  brought the colour into his face  as he answered    He stopped —Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs  Weston  and did not herself know what to think  In a moment he went on—   Emma returned her friend s pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim    He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful—and in a manner which shewed him not pleased  soon afterwards said     Mr  Knightley was thoughtful again  The result of his reverie was   And soon afterwards  
 Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault   said she  
    said Mr  Knightley—
  said Emma triumphantly when he left them  
      CHAPTER XVI  Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr  Elton  was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage  Dinner-parties and evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day    said she  
 No invitation came amiss to her  Her Bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to her  and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners  She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms  at the poor attempt at rout-cakes  and there being no ice in the Highbury card-parties  Mrs  Bates  Mrs  Perry  Mrs  Goddard and others  were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world  but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged  In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party—in which her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style—and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish  to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour  and in the proper order   Emma  in the meanwhile  could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons  They must not do less than others  or she should be exposed to odious suspicions  and imagined capable of pitiful resentment  A dinner there must be  After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes  Mr  Woodhouse felt no unwillingness  and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself  with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him   The persons to be invited  required little thought  Besides the Eltons  it must be the Westons and Mr  Knightley; so far it was all of course—and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:—but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction  and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet s begging to be allowed to decline it    said she  
 Every invitation was successful  They were all disengaged and all happy —The preparatory interest of this dinner  however  was not yet over  A circumstance rather unlucky occurred  The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring  and their papa now proposed bringing them  and staying one whole day at Hartfield—which one day would be the very day of this party —His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off  but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so  Mr  Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear—and here would be a ninth—and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party   She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself  by representing that though he certainly would make them nine  yet he always said so little  that the increase of noise would be very immaterial  She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself  to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother   The event was more favourable to Mr  Woodhouse than to Emma  John Knightley came; but Mr  Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day  He might be able to join them in the evening  but certainly not to dinner  Mr  Woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing him so  with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate  removed the chief of even Emma s vexation   The day came  the party were punctually assembled  and Mr  John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable  Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner  he was talking to Miss Fairfax  Mrs  Elton  as elegant as lace and pearls could make her  he looked at in silence—wanting only to observe enough for Isabella s information—but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl  and he could talk to her  He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys  when it had been just beginning to rain  It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject  and he said     said she  
   Mr  John Knightley smiled  and replied    There was a little blush  and then this answer       replied he coolly  
   said John Knightley  
 It was kindly said  and very far from giving offence  A pleasant     The kind-hearted  polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty  and made every fair lady welcome and easy   By this time  the walk in the rain had reached Mrs  Elton  and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane    Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold     said Mrs  Weston kindly and persuasively  
  eagerly rejoined Mrs  Elton  
—and nodding significantly—
  said Jane; 
   said Jane earnestly  
  Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering  she began speaking again to Mr  John Knightley    said she —
    continued he  smiling  
 The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of  and the usual observations made    said John Knightley  
  said his brother hesitatingly  
  said Mr  Woodhouse; 
 —Emma began  looking also at Mrs  Weston; but stopped  on perceiving that Mrs  Weston was attending to some one else—and the pause gave her time to reflect  
 Mrs  Weston was disengaged and Emma began again—  said Mr  Knightley  
 This was not submitted to by either lady  They vindicated him against the base aspersion    said Emma  
    said Mr  Knightley dryly  
 Dinner was on table —Mrs  Elton  before she could be spoken to  was ready; and before Mr  Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour  was saying—   Jane s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma  She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any  She suspected that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear  and that it had not been in vain  She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual—a glow both of complexion and spirits   She could have made an inquiry or two  as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails;—it was at her tongue s end—but she abstained  She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax s feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the room  arm in arm  with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each       CHAPTER XVII  When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner  Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;—with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs  Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself  She and Mrs  Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together  Mrs  Elton left them no choice  If Jane repressed her for a little time  she soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper  especially on Mrs  Elton s side  there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office—catching cold—fetching letters—and friendship  were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one  which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane—inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her  and professions of Mrs  Elton s meditated activity    said she  
      said Jane  shaking her head; 
   said Jane  
       replied Jane; 
  repeated Mrs  Elton  
    said Jane  
  replied Mrs  Elton gaily  
 In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr  Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object  and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane    The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr  Weston made his appearance among them  He had returned to a late dinner  and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over  He had been too much expected by the best judges  for surprize—but there was great joy  Mr  Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now  as he would have been sorry to see him before  John Knightley only was in mute astonishment —That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London  should set off again  and walk half a mile to another man s house  for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time  of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers  was a circumstance to strike him deeply  A man who had been in motion since eight o clock in the morning  and might now have been still  who had been long talking  and might have been silent  who had been in more than one crowd  and might have been alone!—Such a man  to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside  and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!—Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife  there would have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party  John Knightley looked at him with amazement  then shrugged his shoulders  and said   Mr  Weston meanwhile  perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting  happy and cheerful as usual  and with all the right of being principal talker  which a day spent anywhere from home confers  was making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner  convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten  and spread abroad what public news he had heard  was proceeding to a family communication  which  though principally addressed to Mrs  Weston  he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room  He gave her a letter  it was from Frank  and to herself; he had met with it in his way  and had taken the liberty of opening it    said he  
 The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time  in a voice a little subdued  but very audible to every body    Mrs  Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion  Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them  She was happy  she knew she was happy  and knew she ought to be happy  Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak so fluently  She was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings  and trying to understand the degree of her agitation  which she rather thought was considerable   Mr  Weston  however  too eager to be very observant  too communicative to want others to talk  was very well satisfied with what she did say  and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already   It was well that he took every body s joy for granted  or he might not have thought either Mr  Woodhouse or Mr  Knightley particularly delighted  They were the first entitled  after Mrs  Weston and Emma  to be made happy;—from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax  but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley  that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs  Elton  and her attention disengaged  he necessarily began on the subject with her       CHAPTER XVIII   Mrs  Elton  very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope  smiled most graciously    he continued—
         said Mr  Weston  
   Mrs  Elton eagerly interposed with     Mrs  Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly  It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;—and she was considering in what way she had best retract  when Mr  Weston went on     
    This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by  and Mr  Weston  with a very good grace  immediately exclaimed    He had done his duty and could return to his son    continued he  
  She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing  and Mr  Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on     Mr  Weston was musing    said he presently  
  They were interrupted  Tea was carrying round  and Mr  Weston  having said all that he wanted  soon took the opportunity of walking away   After tea  Mr  and Mrs  Weston  and Mr  Elton sat down with Mr  Woodhouse to cards  The remaining five were left to their own powers  and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr  Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation; Mrs  Elton was wanting notice  which nobody had inclination to pay  and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent   Mr  John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother  He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with—    said Emma  
         said his brother quickly  
   cried Mr  Knightley  
  exclaimed Emma  
 Mr  Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty  upon Mrs  Elton s beginning to talk to him       VOLUME III      CHAPTER I  A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill  She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him  Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;—but if he  who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two  were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away  it would be very distressing  If a separation of two months should not have cooled him  there were dangers and evils before her:—caution for him and for herself would be necessary  She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again  and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his   She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration  That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance! and yet  she could not help rather anticipating something decisive  She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis  an event  a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state   It was not very long  though rather longer than Mr  Weston had foreseen  before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill s feelings  The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined  but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards  He rode down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield  she could then exercise all her quick observation  and speedily determine how he was influenced  and how she must act  They met with the utmost friendliness  There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her  But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done  of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree  She watched him well  It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been  Absence  with the conviction probably of her indifference  had produced this very natural and very desirable effect   He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever  and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit  and recur to old stories: and he was not without agitation  It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference  He was not calm; his spirits were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him  Lively as he was  it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her belief on the subject  was his staying only a quarter of an hour  and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury   This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days  He was often hoping  intending to come—but was always prevented  His aunt could not bear to have him leave her  Such was his own account at Randall s  If he were quite sincere  if he really tried to come  it was to be inferred that Mrs  Churchill s removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder  That she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it  at Randalls  Though much might be fancy  he could not doubt  when he looked back  that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago  He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove  or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on  by all his father s doubts  to say that her complaints were merely imaginary  or that she was as strong as ever   It soon appeared that London was not the place for her  She could not endure its noise  Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering; and by the ten days  end  her nephew s letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan  They were going to remove immediately to Richmond  Mrs  Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there  and had otherwise a fancy for the place  A ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged  and much benefit expected from the change   Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement  and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends—for the house was taken for May and June  She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them  almost as often as he could even wish   Emma saw how Mr  Weston understood these joyous prospects  He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered  She hoped it was not so  Two months must bring it to the proof   Mr  Weston s own happiness was indisputable  He was quite delighted  It was the very circumstance he could have wished for  Now  it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood  What were nine miles to a young man —An hour s ride  He would be always coming over  The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never  Sixteen miles—nay  eighteen—it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street—was a serious obstacle  Were he ever able to get away  the day would be spent in coming and returning  There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse  Better than nearer!  One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal —the ball at the Crown  It had not been forgotten before  but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day  Now  however  it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed  and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond  a few lines from Frank  to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change  and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time  induced them to name as early a day as possible   Mr  Weston s ball was to be a real thing  A very few to-morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness   Mr  Woodhouse was resigned  The time of year lightened the evil to him  May was better for every thing than February  Mrs  Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield  James had due notice  and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them  while dear Emma were gone       CHAPTER II  No misfortune occurred  again to prevent the ball  The day approached  the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching  Frank Churchill  in all the certainty of his own self  reached Randalls before dinner  and every thing was safe   No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma  The room at the Crown was to witness it;—but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd  Mr  Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves  for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came  that she could not refuse him  and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man s company  She was to convey Harriet  and they drove to the Crown in good time  the Randalls party just sufficiently before them   Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not say much  his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening  They all walked about together  to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage  which Emma could not hear the sound of at first  without great surprize   Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr  Weston depended  and felt  that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes  was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity  She liked his open manners  but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher character —General benevolence  but not general friendship  made a man what he ought to be —She could fancy such a man  The whole party walked about  and looked  and praised again; and then  having nothing else to do  formed a sort of half-circle round the fire  to observe in their various modes  till other subjects were started  that  though May  a fire in the evening was still very pleasant   Emma found that it was not Mr  Weston s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger  They had stopped at Mrs  Bates s door to offer the use of their carriage  but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons   Frank was standing by her  but not steadily; there was a restlessness  which shewed a mind not at ease  He was looking about  he was going to the door  he was watching for the sound of other carriages —impatient to begin  or afraid of being always near her   Mrs  Elton was spoken of   said he  
 A carriage was heard  He was on the move immediately; but coming back  said    Mr  and Mrs  Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed    said Mr  Weston  looking about  
 The mistake had been slight  The carriage was sent for them now  Emma longed to know what Frank s first opinion of Mrs  Elton might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress  and her smiles of graciousness  He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion  by giving her very proper attention  after the introduction had passed   In a few minutes the carriage returned —Somebody talked of rain — said Frank to his father: 
  While she talked of his son  Mr  Weston s attention was chained; but when she got to Maple Grove  he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to  and with happy smiles must hurry away   Mrs  Elton turned to Mrs  Weston   Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax  escorted by the two gentlemen  walked into the room; and Mrs  Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs  Weston s to receive them  Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words  every body s words  were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates  who came in talking  and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire  As the door opened she was heard    She was now met by Mrs  Weston —
 Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet  she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs  Elton and Miss Fairfax  who were standing a little way behind her —He was thoughtful  Whether he were overhearing too  she could not determine  After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look  compliments very quietly and properly taken  Mrs  Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself—and it was  —with many other relative questions  all answered with patient politeness  Mrs  Elton then said  
 At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously  that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises  and did not want to hear more;—and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while  till another suspension brought Mrs  Elton s tones again distinctly forward —Mr  Elton had just joined them  and his wife was exclaiming    —repeated Frank Churchill  with a look of surprize and displeasure —
     Then changing from a frown to a smile—
 Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour  He walked off to find his father  but was quickly back again with both Mr  and Mrs  Weston  He had met with them in a little perplexity  which must be laid before Emma  It had just occurred to Mrs  Weston that Mrs  Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction —Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude    said Mr  Weston  
 Frank turned instantly to Emma  to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man  which his father looked his most perfect approbation of—and it then appeared that Mrs  Weston was wanting him to dance with Mrs  Elton himself  and that their business was to help to persuade him into it  which was done pretty soon —Mr  Weston and Mrs  Elton led the way  Mr  Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed  Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs  Elton  though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her  It was almost enough to make her think of marrying  Mrs  Elton had undoubtedly the advantage  at this time  in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill  she could not lose by the change  Mr  Weston might be his son s superior —In spite of this little rub  however  Emma was smiling with enjoyment  delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming  and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her —She was more disturbed by Mr  Knightley s not dancing than by any thing else —There he was  among the standers-by  where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing —not classing himself with the husbands  and fathers  and whist-players  who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up —so young as he looked!—He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere  than where he had placed himself  His tall  firm  upright figure  among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men  was such as Emma felt must draw every body s eyes; and  excepting her own partner  there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him —He moved a few steps nearer  and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner  with what natural grace  he must have danced  would he but take the trouble —Whenever she caught his eye  she forced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave  She wished he could love a ballroom better  and could like Frank Churchill better —He seemed often observing her  She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing  but if he were criticising her behaviour  she did not feel afraid  There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner  They seemed more like cheerful  easy friends  than lovers  That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done  was indubitable   The ball proceeded pleasantly  The anxious cares  the incessant attentions of Mrs  Weston  were not thrown away  Every body seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball  which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be  was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this  Of very important  very recordable events  it was not more productive than such meetings usually are  There was one  however  which Emma thought something of —The two last dances before supper were begun  and Harriet had no partner;—the only young lady sitting down;—and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers  that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!—But Emma s wonder lessened soon afterwards  on seeing Mr  Elton sauntering about  He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not—and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room   Escape  however  was not his plan  He came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected  spoke to some  and walked about in front of them  as if to shew his liberty  and his resolution of maintaining it  He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith  or speaking to those who were close to her —Emma saw it  She was not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom  and had therefore leisure to look around  and by only turning her head a little she saw it all  When she was half-way up the set  the whole group were exactly behind her  and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr  Elton was so near  that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs  Weston; and she perceived that his wife  who was standing immediately above her  was not only listening also  but even encouraging him by significant glances —The kind-hearted  gentle Mrs  Weston had left her seat to join him and say   to which his prompt reply was  
   said he  
  
 Mrs  Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat  This was Mr  Elton! the amiable  obliging  gentle Mr  Elton —She looked round for a moment; he had joined Mr  Knightley at a little distance  and was arranging himself for settled conversation  while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife   She would not look again  Her heart was in a glow  and she feared her face might be as hot   In another moment a happier sight caught her;—Mr  Knightley leading Harriet to the set!—Never had she been more surprized  seldom more delighted  than at that instant  She was all pleasure and gratitude  both for Harriet and herself  and longed to be thanking him; and though too distant for speech  her countenance said much  as soon as she could catch his eye again   His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it  extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky  if it had not been for the cruel state of things before  and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced  It was not thrown away on her  she bounded higher than ever  flew farther down the middle  and was in a continual course of smiles   Mr  Elton had retreated into the card-room  looking  Emma trusted  very foolish  She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife  though growing very like her;—she spoke some of her feelings  by observing audibly to her partner    Supper was announced  The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment  without interruption  till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon    Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr  Knightley till after supper; but  when they were all in the ballroom again  her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked  He was warm in his reprobation of Mr  Elton s conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs  Elton s looks also received the due share of censure    said he  
 He looked with smiling penetration; and  on receiving no answer  added    replied Emma  
 He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it  and he only said        Emma was extremely gratified —They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr  Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again     said Emma  
  She hesitated a moment  and then replied          CHAPTER III  This little explanation with Mr  Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure  It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball  which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy —She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons  and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet  his concession in her favour  was peculiarly gratifying  The impertinence of the Eltons  which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening  had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward to another happy result—the cure of Harriet s infatuation —From Harriet s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom  she had strong hopes  It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened  and she were enabled to see that Mr  Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him  The fever was over  and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy  She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite —Harriet rational  Frank Churchill not too much in love  and Mr  Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her  how very happy a summer must be before her!  She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning  He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield  as he was to be at home by the middle of the day  She did not regret it   Having arranged all these matters  looked them through  and put them all to rights  she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys  as well as of their grandpapa  when the great iron sweep-gate opened  and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together—Frank Churchill  with Harriet leaning on his arm—actually Harriet!—A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened  Harriet looked white and frightened  and he was trying to cheer her —The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;—they were all three soon in the hall  and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away   A young lady who faints  must be recovered; questions must be answered  and surprizes be explained  Such events are very interesting  but the suspense of them cannot last long  A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole   Miss Smith  and Miss Bickerton  another parlour boarder at Mrs  Goddard s  who had been also at the ball  had walked out together  and taken a road  the Richmond road  which  though apparently public enough for safety  had led them into alarm —About half a mile beyond Highbury  making a sudden turn  and deeply shaded by elms on each side  it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it  they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them  on a broader patch of greensward by the side  a party of gipsies  A child on the watch  came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton  excessively frightened  gave a great scream  and calling on Harriet to follow her  ran up a steep bank  cleared a slight hedge at the top  and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury  But poor Harriet could not follow  She had suffered very much from cramp after dancing  and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless—and in this state  and exceedingly terrified  she had been obliged to remain   How the trampers might have behaved  had the young ladies been more courageous  must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children  headed by a stout woman and a great boy  all clamorous  and impertinent in look  though not absolutely in word —More and more frightened  she immediately promised them money  and taking out her purse  gave them a shilling  and begged them not to want more  or to use her ill —She was then able to walk  though but slowly  and was moving away—but her terror and her purse were too tempting  and she was followed  or rather surrounded  by the whole gang  demanding more   In this state Frank Churchill had found her  she trembling and conditioning  they loud and insolent  By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment  The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward  and leave his horses to meet him by another road  a mile or two beyond Highbury—and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates  and to have forgotten to restore them  he had been obliged to stop at her door  and go in for a few minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot  was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them  The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion  He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him  and hardly able to speak  had just strength enough to reach Hartfield  before her spirits were quite overcome  It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other place   This was the amount of the whole story —of his communication and of Harriet s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech —He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs  Goddard  and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr  Knightley  he set off  with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself   Such an adventure as this —a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way  could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain  So Emma thought  at least  Could a linguist  could a grammarian  could even a mathematician have seen what she did  have witnessed their appearance together  and heard their history of it  without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other —How much more must an imaginist  like herself  be on fire with speculation and foresight!—especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made   It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place  within her memory; no rencontre  no alarm of the kind;—and now it had happened to the very person  and at the very hour  when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!—It certainly was very extraordinary!—And knowing  as she did  the favourable state of mind of each at this period  it struck her the more  He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself  she just recovering from her mania for Mr  Elton  It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences  It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other   In the few minutes  conversation which she had yet had with him  while Harriet had been partially insensible  he had spoken of her terror  her naivete  her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm  with a sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last  after Harriet s own account had been given  he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms  Every thing was to take its natural course  however  neither impelled nor assisted  She would not stir a step  nor drop a hint  No  she had had enough of interference  There could be no harm in a scheme  a mere passive scheme  It was no more than a wish  Beyond it she would on no account proceed   Emma s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed —aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible  Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury  It was the very event to engage those who talk most  the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news  The last night s ball seemed lost in the gipsies  Poor Mr  Woodhouse trembled as he sat  and  as Emma had foreseen  would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again  It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse  for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after   as well as Miss Smith  were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer  that they were all very indifferent—which  though not exactly true  for she was perfectly well  and Harriet not much otherwise  Emma would not interfere with  She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man  for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent illnesses for her  she could make no figure in a message   The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took themselves off in a hurry  The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began  and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews:—in her imagination it maintained its ground  and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies  and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital       CHAPTER IV  A very few days had passed after this adventure  when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand  and after sitting down and hesitating  thus began:   Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak  There was a seriousness in Harriet s manner which prepared her  quite as much as her words  for something more than ordinary    she continued  
  said Emma  
  cried Harriet  warmly  
   She held the parcel towards her  and Emma read the words Most precious treasures on the top  Her curiosity was greatly excited  Harriet unfolded the parcel  and she looked on with impatience  Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box  which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but  excepting the cotton  Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister    said Harriet  
    cried Emma  putting her hand before her face  and jumping up  
   said Emma  recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement  And secretly she added to herself  
  resumed Harriet  turning to her box again  
 Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure  It was the end of an old pencil —the part without any lead    said Harriet —
  cried Emma; 
        replied Harriet  
  thought Emma  
 She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made  and could not but hope that the gipsy  though she had told no fortune  might be proved to have made Harriet s —About a fortnight after the alarm  they came to a sufficient explanation  and quite undesignedly  Emma was not thinking of it at the moment  which made the information she received more valuable  She merely said  in the course of some trivial chat  —and thought no more of it  till after a minute s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone  
 Emma then looked up  and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment s debate  as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not  replied     After another short hesitation    cried Harriet indignantly —
—and Emma could just catch the words  
 She then took a longer time for consideration  Should she proceed no farther —should she let it pass  and seem to suspect nothing —Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were totally silent  it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been  such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances  she was perfectly resolved —She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once  all that she meant to say and know  Plain dealing was always best  She had previously determined how far she would proceed  on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both  to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed —She was decided  and thus spoke—       Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude  Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend  Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind—and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation       CHAPTER V  In this state of schemes  and hopes  and connivance  June opened upon Hartfield  To Highbury in general it brought no material change  The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings  and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother s; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed  and August  instead of Midsummer  fixed for it  she was likely to remain there full two months longer  provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs  Elton s activity in her service  and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will   Mr  Knightley  who  for some reason best known to himself  had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill  was only growing to dislike him more  He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma  That Emma was his object appeared indisputable  Every thing declared it; his own attentions  his father s hints  his mother-in-law s guarded silence; it was all in unison; words  conduct  discretion  and indiscretion  told the same story  But while so many were devoting him to Emma  and Emma herself making him over to Harriet  Mr  Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax  He could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them—he thought so at least—symptoms of admiration on his side  which  having once observed  he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning  however he might wish to escape any of Emma s errors of imagination  She was not present when the suspicion first arose  He was dining with the Randalls family  and Jane  at the Eltons ; and he had seen a look  more than a single look  at Miss Fairfax  which  from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse  seemed somewhat out of place  When he was again in their company  he could not help remembering what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which  unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight    brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking  of private understanding even  between Frank Churchill and Jane   He had walked up one day after dinner  as he very often did  to spend his evening at Hartfield  Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined them; and  on returning  they fell in with a larger party  who  like themselves  judged it wisest to take their exercise early  as the weather threatened rain; Mr  and Mrs  Weston and their son  Miss Bates and her niece  who had accidentally met  They all united; and  on reaching Hartfield gates  Emma  who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father  pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him  The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates  which few persons listened to  she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse s most obliging invitation   As they were turning into the grounds  Mr  Perry passed by on horseback  The gentlemen spoke of his horse    said Frank Churchill to Mrs  Weston presently  
 Mrs  Weston looked surprized  and said         cried Mr  Weston  
  replied his son  laughing  
  observed his father  
 Emma was out of hearing  She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance  and was beyond the reach of Mr  Weston s hint    cried Miss Bates  who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes  
 They were entering the hall  Mr  Knightley s eyes had preceded Miss Bates s in a glance at Jane  From Frank Churchill s face  where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away  he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind  and too busy with her shawl  Mr  Weston had walked in  The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass  Mr  Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye—he seemed watching her intently—in vain  however  if it were so—Jane passed between them into the hall  and looked at neither   There was no time for farther remark or explanation  The dream must be borne with  and Mr  Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield  and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use  instead of the small-sized Pembroke  on which two of his daily meals had  for forty years been crowded  Tea passed pleasantly  and nobody seemed in a hurry to move    said Frank Churchill  after examining a table behind him  which he could reach as he sat  
 Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box  the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets  which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves  They were rapidly forming words for each other  or for any body else who would be puzzled  The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr  Woodhouse  who had often been distressed by the more animated sort  which Mr  Weston had occasionally introduced  and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting  with tender melancholy  over the departure of the  Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax  She gave a slight glance round the table  and applied herself to it  Frank was next to Emma  Jane opposite to them—and Mr  Knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much as he could  with as little apparent observation  The word was discovered  and with a faint smile pushed away  If meant to be immediately mixed with the others  and buried from sight  she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across  for it was not mixed; and Harriet  eager after every fresh word  and finding out none  directly took it up  and fell to work  She was sitting by Mr  Knightley  and turned to him for help  The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it  there was a blush on Jane s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible  Mr  Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be  was beyond his comprehension  How the delicacy  the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be some decided involvement  Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn  These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick  It was a child s play  chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill s part   With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm and distrust  to observe also his two blinded companions  He saw a short word prepared for Emma  and given to her with a look sly and demure  He saw that Emma had soon made it out  and found it highly entertaining  though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure; for she said   He heard Frank Churchill next say  with a glance towards Jane  
—and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth  
 It was done however  This gallant young man  who seemed to love without feeling  and to recommend himself without complaisance  directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax  and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it  Mr  Knightley s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be  made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it  and it was not long before he saw it to be Dixon  Jane Fairfax s perception seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning  the superior intelligence  of those five letters so arranged  She was evidently displeased; looked up  and seeing herself watched  blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her  and saying only    cried the latter  though Jane had not spoken a word—
 Jane s alertness in moving  proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived  She was immediately up  and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving  that she could not get away; and Mr  Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her  and resolutely swept away by her unexamined  She was afterwards looking for her shawl—Frank Churchill was looking also—it was growing dusk  and the room was in confusion; and how they parted  Mr  Knightley could not tell   He remained at Hartfield after all the rest  his thoughts full of what he had seen; so full  that when the candles came to assist his observations  he must—yes  he certainly must  as a friend—an anxious friend—give Emma some hint  ask her some question  He could not see her in a situation of such danger  without trying to preserve her  It was his duty    said he  
 Emma was extremely confused  She could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed  she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them    she cried in evident embarrassment  
  he replied gravely  
 He had hoped she would speak again  but she did not  She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak  He sat a little while in doubt  A variety of evils crossed his mind  Interference—fruitless interference  Emma s confusion  and the acknowledged intimacy  seemed to declare her affection engaged  Yet he would speak  He owed it to her  to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference  rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing  rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause    said he at last  with earnest kindness  
    she cried with a most open eagerness—
   She spoke with a confidence which staggered  with a satisfaction which silenced  Mr  Knightley  She was in gay spirits  and would have prolonged the conversation  wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions  every look described  and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet hers  He found he could not be useful  and his feelings were too much irritated for talking  That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever  by the fire which Mr  Woodhouse s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year  he soon afterwards took a hasty leave  and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey       CHAPTER VI  After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr  and Mrs  Suckling  the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn  No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present  In the daily interchange of news  they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings  coming had been united  such as the last accounts of Mrs  Churchill  whose health seemed every day to supply a different report  and the situation of Mrs  Weston  whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child  as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it   Mrs  Elton was very much disappointed  It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade  Her introductions and recommendations must all wait  and every projected party be still only talked of  So she thought at first;—but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off  Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come  They could go there again with them in the autumn  It was settled that they should go to Box Hill  That there was to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the idea of another  Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing  and she and Mr  Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither  Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them  and it was to be done in a quiet  unpretending  elegant way  infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation  the regular eating and drinking  and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings   This was so very well understood between them  that Emma could not but feel some surprise  and a little displeasure  on hearing from Mr  Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs  Elton  as her brother and sister had failed her  that the two parties should unite  and go together; and that as Mrs  Elton had very readily acceded to it  so it was to be  if she had no objection  Now  as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs  Elton  of which Mr  Weston must already be perfectly aware  it was not worth bringing forward again:—it could not be done without a reproof to him  which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs  Elton s party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr  Weston s temper    said he very comfortably  
 Emma denied none of it aloud  and agreed to none of it in private   It was now the middle of June  and the weather fine; and Mrs  Elton was growing impatient to name the day  and settle with Mr  Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb  when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty  It might be weeks  it might be only a few days  before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on  and it was all melancholy stagnation  Mrs  Elton s resources were inadequate to such an attack    she cried —
  replied Mr  Knightley  
 If Mr  Knightley did not begin seriously  he was obliged to proceed so  for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the   said she  
  said he  
   said he: 
  —he calmly replied —
    she cried  satisfied to have no one preferred to herself —
           Mr  Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade  He wished to persuade Mr  Woodhouse  as well as Emma  to join the party; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill  Mr  Woodhouse must not  under the specious pretence of a morning drive  and an hour or two spent at Donwell  be tempted away to his misery   He was invited on good faith  No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity  He did consent  He had not been at Donwell for two years   Mr  Knightley was fortunate in every body s most ready concurrence  The invitation was everywhere so well received  that it seemed as if  like Mrs  Elton  they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves —Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr  Weston  unasked  promised to get Frank over to join them  if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with —Mr  Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him; and Mr  Weston engaged to lose no time in writing  and spare no arguments to induce him to come   In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast  that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was settled for one day  and Box Hill for the next —the weather appearing exactly right   Under a bright mid-day sun  at almost Midsummer  Mr  Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage  with one window down  to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey  especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning  he was happily placed  quite at his ease  ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved  and advise every body to come and sit down  and not to heat themselves —Mrs  Weston  who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired  and sit all the time with him  remained  when all the others were invited or persuaded out  his patient listener and sympathiser   It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey  that as soon as she was satisfied of her father s comfort  she was glad to leave him  and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation  more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family   She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant  as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building  its suitable  becoming  characteristic situation  low and sheltered—its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream  of which the Abbey  with all the old neglect of prospect  had scarcely a sight—and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues  which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up —The house was larger than Hartfield  and totally unlike it  covering a good deal of ground  rambling and irregular  with many comfortable  and one or two handsome rooms —It was just what it ought to be  and it looked what it was—and Emma felt an increasing respect for it  as the residence of a family of such true gentility  untainted in blood and understanding —Some faults of temper John Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably  She had given them neither men  nor names  nor places  that could raise a blush  These were pleasant feelings  and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did  and collect round the strawberry-beds —The whole party were assembled  excepting Frank Churchill  who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs  Elton  in all her apparatus of happiness  her large bonnet and her basket  was very ready to lead the way in gathering  accepting  or talking—strawberries  and only strawberries  could now be thought or spoken of — Such  for half an hour  was the conversation—interrupted only once by Mrs  Weston  who came out  in her solicitude after her son-in-law  to inquire if he were come—and she was a little uneasy —She had some fears of his horse   Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs  Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of —A situation  a most desirable situation  was in question  Mrs  Elton had received notice of it that morning  and was in raptures  It was not with Mrs  Suckling  it was not with Mrs  Bragge  but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs  Bragge  an acquaintance of Mrs  Suckling  a lady known at Maple Grove  Delightful  charming  superior  first circles  spheres  lines  ranks  every thing—and Mrs  Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately —On her side  all was warmth  energy  and triumph—and she positively refused to take her friend s negative  though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing  repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before —Still Mrs  Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow s post —How Jane could bear it at all  was astonishing to Emma —She did look vexed  she did speak pointedly—and at last  with a decision of action unusual to her  proposed a removal — It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered  dispersed way  scarcely any three together  they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes  which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river  seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds —It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars  which seemed intended  in their erection  to give the appearance of an approach to the house  which never had been there  Disputable  however  as might be the taste of such a termination  it was in itself a charming walk  and the view which closed it extremely pretty —The considerable slope  at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood  gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur  well clothed with wood;—and at the bottom of this bank  favourably placed and sheltered  rose the Abbey Mill Farm  with meadows in front  and the river making a close and handsome curve around it   It was a sweet view—sweet to the eye and the mind  English verdure  English culture  English comfort  seen under a sun bright  without being oppressive   In this walk Emma and Mr  Weston found all the others assembled; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr  Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest  quietly leading the way  Mr  Knightley and Harriet!—It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it —There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion  and turned from her with little ceremony  Now they seemed in pleasant conversation  There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not  It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty  its rich pastures  spreading flocks  orchard in blossom  and light column of smoke ascending —She joined them at the wall  and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around  He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture  etc  and Emma received a smile which seemed to say   The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;—and they were all seated and busy  and still Frank Churchill did not come  Mrs  Weston looked  and looked in vain  His father would not own himself uneasy  and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare  He had expressed himself as to coming  with more than common certainty   The cold repast was over  and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen  the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far as the clover  which was to be begun cutting on the morrow  or  at any rate  have the pleasure of being hot  and growing cool again —Mr  Woodhouse  who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens  where no damps from the river were imagined even by him  stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him  that Mrs  Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need   Mr  Knightley had done all in his power for Mr  Woodhouse s entertainment  Books of engravings  drawers of medals  cameos  corals  shells  and every other family collection within his cabinets  had been prepared for his old friend  to while away the morning; and the kindness had perfectly answered  Mr  Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused  Mrs  Weston had been shewing them all to him  and now he would shew them all to Emma;—fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child  than in a total want of taste for what he saw  for he was slow  constant  and methodical —Before this second looking over was begun  however  Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments  free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the house—and was hardly there  when Jane Fairfax appeared  coming quickly in from the garden  and with a look of escape —Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon  there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of    said she  
     She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied   —she answered—
 Emma had not another word to oppose  She saw it all; and entering into her feelings  promoted her quitting the house immediately  and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend  Her parting look was grateful—and her parting words    said Emma  as she turned back into the hall again  
 Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour  and they had only accomplished some views of St  Mark s Place  Venice  when Frank Churchill entered the room  Emma had not been thinking of him  she had forgotten to think of him—but she was very glad to see him  Mrs  Weston would be at ease  The black mare was blameless; they were right who had named Mrs  Churchill as the cause  He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure  which had lasted some hours—and he had quite given up every thought of coming  till very late;—and had he known how hot a ride he should have  and how late  with all his hurry  he must be  he believed he should not have come at all  The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing like it—almost wished he had staid at home—nothing killed him like heat—he could bear any degree of cold  etc   but heat was intolerable—and he sat down  at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr  Woodhouse s fire  looking very deplorable     Emma listened  and looked  and soon perceived that Frank Churchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour  Some people were always cross when they were hot  Such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints  she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining-room—and she humanely pointed out the door     He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal  and came back all the better—grown quite cool—and  with good manners  like himself—able to draw a chair close to them  take an interest in their employment; and regret  in a reasonable way  that he should be so late  He was not in his best spirits  but seemed trying to improve them; and  at last  made himself talk nonsense very agreeably  They were looking over views in Swisserland    said he  
              The rest of the party were now returning  and all were soon collected  With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax s disappearance being explained  That it was time for every body to go  concluded the subject; and with a short final arrangement for the next day s scheme  they parted  Frank Churchill s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much  that his last words to Emma were    She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening       CHAPTER VII  They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement  accommodation  and punctuality  were in favour of a pleasant party  Mr  Weston directed the whole  officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage  and every body was in good time  Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece  with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback  Mrs  Weston remained with Mr  Woodhouse  Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there  Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment  and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency  There was a languor  a want of spirits  a want of union  which could not be got over  They separated too much into parties  The Eltons walked together; Mr  Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill  And Mr  Weston tried  in vain  to make them harmonise better  It seemed at first an accidental division  but it never materially varied  Mr  and Mrs  Elton  indeed  shewed no unwillingness to mix  and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill  there seemed a principle of separation  between the other parties  too strong for any fine prospects  or any cold collation  or any cheerful Mr  Weston  to remove   At first it was downright dulness to Emma  She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid  He said nothing worth hearing—looked without seeing—admired without intelligence—listened without knowing what she said  While he was so dull  it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable   When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better  for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay  making her his first object  Every distinguishing attention that could be paid  was paid to her  To amuse her  and be agreeable in her eyes  seemed all that he cared for—and Emma  glad to be enlivened  not sorry to be flattered  was gay and easy too  and gave him all the friendly encouragement  the admission to be gallant  which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now  in her own estimation  meant nothing  though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe    said he  
             replied he  with lively impudence  
 And then whispering—
 Some laughed  and answered good-humouredly  Miss Bates said a great deal; Mrs  Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse s presiding; Mr  Knightley s answer was the most distinct    —cried Emma  laughing as carelessly as she could—
  cried Mrs  Elton emphatically  
 Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured  in reply     whispered Frank to Emma; 
  exclaimed Miss Bates  
 Emma could not resist    Miss Bates  deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner  did not immediately catch her meaning; but  when it burst on her  it could not anger  though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her     cried Mr  Weston  
  answered his son;—
  said Emma  
  said Mr  Weston  
   Understanding and gratification came together  It might be a very indifferent piece of wit  but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it—and so did Frank and Harriet —It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it  and Mr  Knightley gravely said     said Mrs  Elton; 
Yes  yes  pray pass me 
I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse  or any other young lady  An old married man—quite good for nothing  Shall we walk  Augusta 
With all my heart  I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot  Come  Jane  take my other arm 
Happy couple!
How well they suit one another!—Very lucky—marrying as they did  upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!—They only knew each other  I think  a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!—for as to any real knowledge of a person s disposition that Bath  or any public place  can give—it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge  It is only by seeing women in their own homes  among their own set  just as they always are  that you can form any just judgment  Short of that  it is all guess and luck—and will generally be ill-luck  How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance  and rued it all the rest of his life!
Such things do occur  undoubtedly 
You were speaking 
I was only going to observe  that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women  I cannot imagine them to be very frequent  A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise—but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards  I would be understood to mean  that it can be only weak  irresolute characters   whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance   who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience  an oppression for ever 
Well  I have so little confidence in my own judgment  that whenever I marry  I hope some body will chuse my wife for me  Will you   turning to Emma   Will you chuse a wife for me —I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you  You provide for the family  you know   with a smile at his father   Find some body for me  I am in no hurry  Adopt her  educate her 
And make her like myself 
By all means  if you can 
Very well  I undertake the commission  You shall have a charming wife 
She must be very lively  and have hazle eyes  I care for nothing else  I shall go abroad for a couple of years—and when I return  I shall come to you for my wife  Remember 
Now  ma am 
shall we join Mrs  Elton 
If you please  my dear  With all my heart  I am quite ready  I was ready to have gone with her  but this will do just as well  We shall soon overtake her  There she is—no  that s somebody else  That s one of the ladies in the Irish car party  not at all like her —Well  I declare—
Emma  I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed  perhaps  but I must still use it  I cannot see you acting wrong  without a remonstrance  How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates  How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character  age  and situation —Emma  I had not thought it possible 
Nay  how could I help saying what I did —Nobody could have helped it  It was not so very bad  I dare say she did not understand me 
I assure you she did  She felt your full meaning  She has talked of it since  I wish you could have heard how she talked of it—with what candour and generosity  I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance  in being able to pay her such attentions  as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father  when her society must be so irksome 
Oh!
I know there is not a better creature in the world: but you must allow  that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her 
They are blended 
I acknowledge; and  were she prosperous  I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good  Were she a woman of fortune  I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance  I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner  Were she your equal in situation—but  Emma  consider how far this is from being the case  She is poor; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and  if she live to old age  must probably sink more  Her situation should secure your compassion  It was badly done  indeed! You  whom she had known from an infant  whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour  to have you now  in thoughtless spirits  and the pride of the moment  laugh at her  humble her—and before her niece  too—and before others  many of whom  certainly some   would be entirely guided by your treatment of her —This is not pleasant to you  Emma—and it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must  I will —I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel  and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now 
How could you be so unfeeling to your father —I must  I will tell you truths while I can 
The ladies were all at home 
Well  my dear  I shall say you are laid down upon the bed  and I am sure you are ill enough 
I am afraid Jane is not very well 
but I do not know; they tell me she is well  I dare say my daughter will be here presently  Miss Woodhouse  I hope you find a chair  I wish Hetty had not gone  I am very little able—Have you a chair  ma am  Do you sit where you like  I am sure she will be here presently 
Very happy and obliged
Ah! Miss Woodhouse  how kind you are!—I suppose you have heard—and are come to give us joy  This does not seem much like joy  indeed  in me— twinkling away a tear or two —but it will be very trying for us to part with her  after having had her so long  and she has a dreadful headache just now  writing all the morning:—such long letters  you know  to be written to Colonel Campbell  and Mrs  Dixon   My dear   said I   you will blind yourself —for tears were in her eyes perpetually  One cannot wonder  one cannot wonder  It is a great change; and though she is amazingly fortunate—such a situation  I suppose  as no young woman before ever met with on first going out—do not think us ungrateful  Miss Woodhouse  for such surprising good fortune— again dispersing her tears —but  poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she has  When one is in great pain  you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve  She is as low as possible  To look at her  nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation  You will excuse her not coming to you—she is not able—she is gone into her own room—I want her to lie down upon the bed   My dear   said I   I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:  but  however  she is not; she is walking about the room  But  now that she has written her letters  she says she shall soon be well  She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you  Miss Woodhouse  but your kindness will excuse her  You were kept waiting at the door—I was quite ashamed—but somehow there was a little bustle—for it so happened that we had not heard the knock  and till you were on the stairs  we did not know any body was coming   It is only Mrs  Cole   said I   depend upon it  Nobody else would come so early    Well   said she   it must be borne some time or other  and it may as well be now   But then Patty came in  and said it was you   Oh!  said I   it is Miss Woodhouse: I am sure you will like to see her  — I can see nobody   said she; and up she got  and would go away; and that was what made us keep you waiting—and extremely sorry and ashamed we were   If you must go  my dear   said I   you must  and I will say you are laid down upon the bed  
It must be a severe trial to them all  She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell s return 
So very kind!
But you are always kind 
always;
Where—may I ask —is Miss Fairfax going 
To a Mrs  Smallridge—charming woman—most superior—to have the charge of her three little girls—delightful children  Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except  perhaps  Mrs  Suckling s own family  and Mrs  Bragge s; but Mrs  Smallridge is intimate with both  and in the very same neighbourhood:—lives only four miles from Maple Grove  Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove 
Mrs  Elton  I suppose  has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes—
Yes  our good Mrs  Elton  The most indefatigable  true friend  She would not take a denial  She would not let Jane say   No;  for when Jane first heard of it   it was the day before yesterday  the very morning we were at Donwell   when Jane first heard of it  she was quite decided against accepting the offer  and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say  she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell s return  and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present—and so she told Mrs  Elton over and over again—and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind!—but that good Mrs  Elton  whose judgment never fails her  saw farther than I did  It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did  and refuse to take Jane s answer; but she positively declared she would not write any such denial yesterday  as Jane wished her; she would wait—and  sure enough  yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go  Quite a surprize to me! I had not the least idea!—Jane took Mrs  Elton aside  and told her at once  that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs  Smallridge s situation  she had come to the resolution of accepting it —I did not know a word of it till it was all settled 
You spent the evening with Mrs  Elton 
Yes  all of us; Mrs  Elton would have us come  It was settled so  upon the hill  while we were walking about with Mr  Knightley   You must all spend your evening with us   said she— I positively must have you all come  
Mr  Knightley was there too  was he 
No  not Mr  Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I thought he would come  because Mrs  Elton declared she would not let him off  he did not;—but my mother  and Jane  and I  were all there  and a very agreeable evening we had  Such kind friends  you know  Miss Woodhouse  one must always find agreeable  though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning s party  Even pleasure  you know  is fatiguing—and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it  However  I shall always think it a very pleasant party  and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it 
Miss Fairfax  I suppose  though you were not aware of it  had been making up her mind the whole day 
I dare say she had 
Whenever the time may come  it must be unwelcome to her and all her friends—but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is possible—I mean  as to the character and manners of the family 
Thank you  dear Miss Woodhouse  Yes  indeed  there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it  Except the Sucklings and Bragges  there is not such another nursery establishment  so liberal and elegant  in all Mrs  Elton s acquaintance  Mrs  Smallridge  a most delightful woman!—A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove—and as to the children  except the little Sucklings and little Bragges  there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere  Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!—It will be nothing but pleasure  a life of pleasure —And her salary!—I really cannot venture to name her salary to you  Miss Woodhouse  Even you  used as you are to great sums  would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane 
Ah! madam 
if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself  I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions  dearly earned 
You are so noble in your ideas!
And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you 
Very soon  very soon  indeed; that s the worst of it  Within a fortnight  Mrs  Smallridge is in a great hurry  My poor mother does not know how to bear it  So then  I try to put it out of her thoughts  and say  Come ma am  do not let us think about it any more 
Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and Mrs  Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return 
Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet  this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining  I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs  Elton  and when Mrs  Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was before tea—stay—no  it could not be before tea  because we were just going to cards—and yet it was before tea  because I remember thinking—Oh! no  now I recollect  now I have it; something happened before tea  but not that  Mr  Elton was called out of the room before tea  old John Abdy s son wanted to speak with him  Poor old John  I have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now  poor old man  he is bed-ridden  and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints—I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane  I am sure  if she gets out at all  And poor John s son came to talk to Mr  Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself  you know  being head man at the Crown  ostler  and every thing of that sort  but still he cannot keep his father without some help; and so  when Mr  Elton came back  he told us what John ostler had been telling him  and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr  Frank Churchill to Richmond  That was what happened before tea  It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs  Elton 
Aye  I see what you are thinking of  the pianoforte  What is to become of that —Very true  Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now — You must go   said she   You and I must part  You will have no business here —Let it stay  however   said she;  give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back  I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties  —And to this day  I do believe  she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s 
I would not go away without seeing you  but I have no time to spare  and therefore must now be gone directly  I am going to London  to spend a few days with John and Isabella  Have you any thing to send or say  besides the  love   which nobody carries 
Nothing at all  But is not this a sudden scheme 
Yes—rather—I have been thinking of it some little time 
Well  my dear  and did you get there safely —And how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter —I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming  Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs  and Miss Bates  Mr  Knightley  as I told you before  She is always so attentive to them!
I am very glad  indeed  my dear  to hear she is to be so comfortably settled  Mrs  Elton is very good-natured and agreeable  and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be  I hope it is a dry situation  and that her health will be taken good care of  It ought to be a first object  as I am sure poor Miss Taylor s always was with me  You know  my dear  she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us  And I hope she will be better off in one respect  and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long 
Poor Mrs  Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal: more than any body had ever supposed—and continual pain would try the temper  It was a sad event—a great shock—with all her faults  what would Mr  Churchill do without her  Mr  Churchill s loss would be dreadful indeed  Mr  Churchill would never get over it 
Ah! poor woman  who would have thought it!
Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;
Miss Fairfax s compliments and thanks  but is quite unequal to any exercise 
Indeed  the truth was  that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body—any body at all—Mrs  Elton  indeed  could not be denied—and Mrs  Cole had made such a point—and Mrs  Perry had said so much—but  except them  Jane would really see nobody 
dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back; it was a thing she could not take—and  moreover  she insisted on her saying  that she was not at all in want of any thing 
could not stay five minutes  and wanted particularly to speak with her 
Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning —Do  if it be possible  Mrs  Weston wants to see you  She must see you 
Is she unwell 
No  no  not at all—only a little agitated  She would have ordered the carriage  and come to you  but she must see you alone  and that you know— nodding towards her father —Humph!—Can you come 
Certainly  This moment  if you please  It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way  But what can be the matter —Is she really not ill 
Depend upon me—but ask no more questions  You will know it all in time  The most unaccountable business! But hush  hush!
Now 
now Mr  Weston  do let me know what has happened 
No  no 
Don t ask me  I promised my wife to leave it all to her  She will break it to you better than I can  Do not be impatient  Emma; it will all come out too soon 
Break it to me 
Good God!—Mr  Weston  tell me at once —Something has happened in Brunswick Square  I know it has  Tell me  I charge you tell me this moment what it is 
No  indeed you are mistaken 
Mr  Weston do not trifle with me —Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square  Which of them is it —I charge you by all that is sacred  not to attempt concealment 
Upon my word  Emma 
Your word!—why not your honour!—why not say upon your honour  that it has nothing to do with any of them  Good Heavens!—What can be to be broke to me  that does not relate to one of that family 
Upon my honour 
it does not  It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley 
I was wrong 
in talking of its being broke to you  I should not have used the expression  In fact  it does not concern you—it concerns only myself —that is  we hope —Humph!—In short  my dear Emma  there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it  I don t say that it is not a disagreeable business—but things might be much worse —If we walk fast  we shall soon be at Randalls 
Who is that gentleman on horseback 
I do not know —One of the Otways —Not Frank;—it is not Frank  I assure you  You will not see him  He is half way to Windsor by this time 
Has your son been with you  then 
Oh! yes—did not you know —Well  well  never mind 
Yes  Frank came over this morning  just to ask us how we did 
Well  my dear 
I have brought her  and now I hope you will soon be better  I shall leave you together  There is no use in delay  I shall not be far off  if you want me 
I have been as good as my word  She has not the least idea 
What is it my dear friend  Something of a very unpleasant nature  I find  has occurred;—do let me know directly what it is  I have been walking all this way in complete suspense  We both abhor suspense  Do not let mine continue longer  It will do you good to speak of your distress  whatever it may be 
Have you indeed no idea 
Cannot you  my dear Emma—cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear 
So far as that it relates to Mr  Frank Churchill  I do guess 
You are right  It does relate to him  and I will tell you directly;
He has been here this very morning  on a most extraordinary errand  It is impossible to express our surprize  He came to speak to his father on a subject —to announce an attachment—
More than an attachment  indeed 
an engagement—a positive engagement —What will you say  Emma—what will any body say  when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;—nay  that they have been long engaged!
Jane Fairfax!—Good God! You are not serious  You do not mean it 
You may well be amazed 
You may well be amazed  But it is even so  There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October—formed at Weymouth  and kept a secret from every body  Not a creature knowing it but themselves—neither the Campbells  nor her family  nor his —It is so wonderful  that though perfectly convinced of the fact  it is yet almost incredible to myself  I can hardly believe it —I thought I knew him 
Well 
this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day  before I can at all comprehend it  What!—engaged to her all the winter—before either of them came to Highbury 
Engaged since October —secretly engaged —It has hurt me  Emma  very much  It has hurt his father equally  Some part of his conduct we cannot excuse 
I will not pretend not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power  be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me  as you are apprehensive of 
That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast  of my present perfect indifference 
I will farther tell you  that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance  when I did like him  when I was very much disposed to be attached to him—nay  was attached—and how it came to cease  is perhaps the wonder  Fortunately  however  it did cease  I have really for some time past  for at least these three months  cared nothing about him  You may believe me  Mrs  Weston  This is the simple truth 
Mr  Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself 
On this point we have been wretched  It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other—and we were persuaded that it was so — Imagine what we have been feeling on your account 
I have escaped; and that I should escape  may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself  But this does not acquit him  Mrs  Weston; and I must say  that I think him greatly to blame  What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged  and with manners so very disengaged  What right had he to endeavour to please  as he certainly did—to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention  as he certainly did—while he really belonged to another —How could he tell what mischief he might be doing —How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him —very wrong  very wrong indeed 
From something that he said  my dear Emma  I rather imagine—
And how could she bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness! to look on  while repeated attentions were offering to another woman  before her face  and not resent it —That is a degree of placidity  which I can neither comprehend nor respect 
There were misunderstandings between them  Emma; he said so expressly  He had not time to enter into much explanation  He was here only a quarter of an hour  and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay—but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said  The present crisis  indeed  seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct 
Impropriety! Oh! Mrs  Weston—it is too calm a censure  Much  much beyond impropriety!—It has sunk him  I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion  So unlike what a man should be!—None of that upright integrity  that strict adherence to truth and principle  that disdain of trick and littleness  which a man should display in every transaction of his life 
Nay  dear Emma  now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong in this instance  I have known him long enough to answer for his having many  very many  good qualities; and—
Good God!
Mrs  Smallridge  too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy  To suffer her to engage herself—to suffer her even to think of such a measure!
He knew nothing about it  Emma  On this article I can fully acquit him  It was a private resolution of hers  not communicated to him—or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction —Till yesterday  I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans  They burst on him  I do not know how  but by some letter or message—and it was the discovery of what she was doing  of this very project of hers  which determined him to come forward at once  own it all to his uncle  throw himself on his kindness  and  in short  put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long 
I am to hear from him soon 
He told me at parting  that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now  Let us wait  therefore  for this letter  It may bring many extenuations  It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood  Don t let us be severe  don t let us be in a hurry to condemn him  Let us have patience  I must love him; and now that I am satisfied on one point  the one material point  I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well  and ready to hope that it may  They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment 
His sufferings 
do not appear to have done him much harm  Well  and how did Mr  Churchill take it 
Most favourably for his nephew—gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty  Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family! While poor Mrs  Churchill lived  I suppose there could not have been a hope  a chance  a possibility;—but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault  than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required  What a blessing it is  when undue influence does not survive the grave!—He gave his consent with very little persuasion 
Ah!
he would have done as much for Harriet 
This was settled last night  and Frank was off with the light this morning  He stopped at Highbury  at the Bates s  I fancy  some time—and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle  to whom he is just now more necessary than ever  that  as I tell you  he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour —He was very much agitated—very much  indeed—to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before —In addition to all the rest  there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell  which he had had no previous suspicion of—and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal 
And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy —The Campbells  the Dixons  did none of them know of the engagement 
None; not one  He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves 
Well 
I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea  and I wish them very happy  But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding  What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit —espionage  and treachery —To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to judge us all!—Here have we been  the whole winter and spring  completely duped  fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour  with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round  comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear —They must take the consequence  if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!
I am quite easy on that head 
I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other  which both might not have heard 
You are in luck —Your only blunder was confined to my ear  when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady 
True  But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax  I never could  under any blunder  have spoken ill of her; and as to speaking ill of him  there I must have been safe 
Now  dearest Emma  let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease  and incline him to be satisfied with the match  Let us make the best of it—and  indeed  almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour  It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr  Churchill does not feel that  why should we  and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him  for Frank  I mean  that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for—and still am disposed to give her credit for  in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right  And how much may be said in her situation for even that error!
Much  indeed!
If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself  it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax s —Of such  one may almost say  that  the world is not their s  nor the world s law  
A very pretty trick you have been playing me  upon my word! This was a device  I suppose  to sport with my curiosity  and exercise my talent of guessing  But you really frightened me  I thought you had lost half your property  at least  And here  instead of its being a matter of condolence  it turns out to be one of congratulation —I congratulate you  Mr  Weston  with all my heart  on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter 
Harriet  poor Harriet!
Emma  you have been no friend to Harriet Smith 
But  with common sense 
I am afraid I have had little to do 
For the present  the whole affair was to be completely a secret  Mr  Churchill had made a point of it  as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum 
Well  Miss Woodhouse!
is not this the oddest news that ever was 
What news do you mean 
About Jane Fairfax  Did you ever hear any thing so strange  Oh!—you need not be afraid of owning it to me  for Mr  Weston has told me himself  I met him just now  He told me it was to be a great secret; and  therefore  I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you  but he said you knew it 
What did Mr  Weston tell you 
Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr  Frank Churchill are to be married  and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while  How very odd!
Had you any idea 
of his being in love with her —You  perhaps  might —You  blushing as she spoke  who can see into every body s heart; but nobody else—
Upon my word 
I begin to doubt my having any such talent  Can you seriously ask me  Harriet  whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was—tacitly  if not openly—encouraging you to give way to your own feelings —I never had the slightest suspicion  till within the last hour  of Mr  Frank Churchill s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax  You may be very sure that if I had  I should have cautioned you accordingly 
Me!
Why should you caution me —You do not think I care about Mr  Frank Churchill 
I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject 
but you do not mean to deny that there was a time—and not very distant either—when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him 
Him!—never  never  Dear Miss Woodhouse  how could you so mistake me 
Harriet!
What do you mean —Good Heaven! what do you mean —Mistake you!—Am I to suppose then —
I should not have thought it possible 
that you could have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him—but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else  I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person  Mr  Frank Churchill  indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other  I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr  Frank Churchill  who is like nobody by his side  And that you should have been so mistaken  is amazing!—I am sure  but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment  I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost  to dare to think of him  At first  if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity  those were your very words ;—I should not have dared to give way to—I should not have thought it possible—But if you  who had been always acquainted with him—
Harriet!
Let us understand each other now  without the possibility of farther mistake  Are you speaking of—Mr  Knightley 
To be sure I am  I never could have an idea of any body else—and so I thought you knew  When we talked about him  it was as clear as possible 
Not quite 
for all that you then said  appeared to me to relate to a different person  I could almost assert that you had named Mr  Frank Churchill  I am sure the service Mr  Frank Churchill had rendered you  in protecting you from the gipsies  was spoken of 
Oh! Miss Woodhouse  how you do forget!
My dear Harriet  I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion  I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you  it was extremely natural:—and you agreed to it  expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service  and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue —The impression of it is strong on my memory 
Oh  dear 
now I recollect what you mean; but I was thinking of something very different at the time  It was not the gipsies—it was not Mr  Frank Churchill that I meant  No!  with some elevation  I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance—of Mr  Knightley s coming and asking me to dance  when Mr  Elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room  That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth 
Good God!
this has been a most unfortunate—most deplorable mistake!—What is to be done 
You would not have encouraged me  then  if you had understood me  At least  however  I cannot be worse off than I should have been  if the other had been the person; and now—it is possible—
I do not wonder  Miss Woodhouse 
that you should feel a great difference between the two  as to me or as to any body  You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other  But I hope  Miss Woodhouse  that supposing—that if—strange as it may appear—  But you know they were your own words  that more wonderful things had happened  matches of greater disparity had taken place than between Mr  Frank Churchill and me; and  therefore  it seems as if such a thing even as this  may have occurred before—and if I should be so fortunate  beyond expression  as to—if Mr  Knightley should really—if he does not mind the disparity  I hope  dear Miss Woodhouse  you will not set yourself against it  and try to put difficulties in the way  But you are too good for that  I am sure 
Have you any idea of Mr  Knightley s returning your affection 
Yes 
I must say that I have 
  When Harriet had closed her evidence  she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse  to say whether she had not good ground for hope    said she  
 The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech  the many bitter feelings  made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma s side  to enable her to say on reply    Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness  which at that moment would have been dreadful penance  by the sound of her father s footsteps  He was coming through the hall  Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him  —with most ready encouragement from her friend  therefore  she passed off through another door—and the moment she was gone  this was the spontaneous burst of Emma s feelings: 
 The rest of the day  the following night  were hardly enough for her thoughts —She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours  Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her —How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself  and living under!—The blunders  the blindness of her own head and heart!—she sat still  she walked about  she tried her own room  she tried the shrubbery—in every place  every posture  she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched  and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness   To understand  thoroughly understand her own heart  was the first endeavour  To that point went every leisure moment which her father s claims on her allowed  and every moment of involuntary absence of mind   How long had Mr  Knightley been so dear to her  as every feeling declared him now to be  When had his influence  such influence begun — When had he succeeded to that place in her affection  which Frank Churchill had once  for a short period  occupied —She looked back; she compared the two—compared them  as they had always stood in her estimation  from the time of the latter s becoming known to her—and as they must at any time have been compared by her  had it—oh! had it  by any blessed felicity  occurred to her  to institute the comparison —She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr  Knightley as infinitely the superior  or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear  She saw  that in persuading herself  in fancying  in acting to the contrary  she had been entirely under a delusion  totally ignorant of her own heart—and  in short  that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!  This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection  This was the knowledge of herself  on the first question of inquiry  which she reached; and without being long in reaching it —She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her—her affection for Mr  Knightley —Every other part of her mind was disgusting   With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body s destiny  She was proved to have been universally mistaken; and she had not quite done nothing—for she had done mischief  She had brought evil on Harriet  on herself  and she too much feared  on Mr  Knightley —Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place  on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his attachment  she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet s;—and even were this not the case  he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly   Mr  Knightley and Harriet Smith!—It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind —The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace  threadbare  stale in the comparison  exciting no surprize  presenting no disparity  affording nothing to be said or thought —Mr  Knightley and Harriet Smith!—Such an elevation on her side! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion  to foresee the smiles  the sneers  the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother  the thousand inconveniences to himself —Could it be —No; it was impossible  And yet it was far  very far  from impossible —Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers  Was it new for one  perhaps too busy to seek  to be the prize of a girl who would seek him —Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal  inconsistent  incongruous—or for chance and circumstance  as second causes  to direct the human fate   Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she ought  and where he had told her she ought!—Had she not  with a folly which no tongue could express  prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong—all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been   How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr  Knightley!—How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!—But Harriet was less humble  had fewer scruples than formerly —Her inferiority  whether of mind or situation  seemed little felt —She had seemed more sensible of Mr  Elton s being to stoop in marrying her  than she now seemed of Mr  Knightley s —Alas! was not that her own doing too  Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself —Who but herself had taught her  that she was to elevate herself if possible  and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment —If Harriet  from being humble  were grown vain  it was her doing too       CHAPTER XII  Till now that she was threatened with its loss  Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr  Knightley  first in interest and affection —Satisfied that it was so  and feeling it her due  she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted  found how inexpressibly important it had been —Long  very long  she felt she had been first; for  having no female connexions of his own  there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers  and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella  She had herself been first with him for many years past  She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse  slighting his advice  or even wilfully opposing him  insensible of half his merits  and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own—but still  from family attachment and habit  and thorough excellence of mind  he had loved her  and watched over her from a girl  with an endeavour to improve her  and an anxiety for her doing right  which no other creature had at all shared  In spite of all her faults  she knew she was dear to him; might she not say  very dear —When the suggestions of hope  however  which must follow here  presented themselves  she could not presume to indulge them  Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly  exclusively  passionately loved by Mr  Knightley  She could not  She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to her  She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality —How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly  how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!—Not too strongly for the offence—but far  far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill —She had no hope  nothing to deserve the name of hope  that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope  at times a slight one  at times much stronger   that Harriet might have deceived herself  and be overrating his regard for her —Wish it she must  for his sake—be the consequence nothing to herself  but his remaining single all his life  Could she be secure of that  indeed  of his never marrying at all  she believed she should be perfectly satisfied —Let him but continue the same Mr  Knightley to her and her father  the same Mr  Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence  and her peace would be fully secured —Marriage  in fact  would not do for her  It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father  and with what she felt for him  Nothing should separate her from her father  She would not marry  even if she were asked by Mr  Knightley   It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she hoped  that when able to see them together again  she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were —She should see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching  she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here —He was expected back every day  The power of observation would be soon given—frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course  In the meanwhile  she resolved against seeing Harriet —It would do neither of them good  it would do the subject no good  to be talking of it farther —She was resolved not to be convinced  as long as she could doubt  and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet s confidence  To talk would be only to irritate —She wrote to her  therefore  kindly  but decisively  to beg that she would not  at present  come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction  that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided; and hoping  that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again  except in the company of others—she objected only to a tete-a-tete—they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday —Harriet submitted  and approved  and was grateful   This point was just arranged  when a visitor arrived to tear Emma s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them  sleeping or waking  the last twenty-four hours—Mrs  Weston  who had been calling on her daughter-in-law elect  and took Hartfield in her way home  almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself  to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview   Mr  Weston had accompanied her to Mrs  Bates s  and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing  was now returned with much more to say  and much more to say with satisfaction  than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs  Bates s parlour  with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings  could have afforded   A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her friend related  Mrs  Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present  to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead  and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed  and Mr  Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement s becoming known; as  considering every thing  she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:—but Mr  Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family  and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were  that it would be of any consequence; for  he observed  
  continued Mrs  Weston  
  said Emma  
   said Emma again  
   returned Emma  sighing  
  she said  
  said Emma  seriously  
 Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs  Weston  She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and  what was more  she loved him very much  and her defence was  therefore  earnest  She talked with a great deal of reason  and at least equal affection—but she had too much to urge for Emma s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs  Weston ended with     Mrs  Weston s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection  by increasing her esteem and compassion  and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax  She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her  and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been  in some measure  the cause  Had she followed Mr  Knightley s known wishes  in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax  which was every way her due; had she tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must  in all probability  have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now —Birth  abilities  and education  had been equally marking one as an associate for her  to be received with gratitude; and the other—what was she —Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax s confidence on this important matter—which was most probable—still  in knowing her as she ought  and as she might  she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr  Dixon  which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself  but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane s feelings  by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill s  Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former  since her coming to Highbury  she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst  She must have been a perpetual enemy  They never could have been all three together  without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax s peace in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill  perhaps  it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more   The evening of this day was very long  and melancholy  at Hartfield  The weather added what it could of gloom  A cold stormy rain set in  and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs  which the wind was despoiling  and the length of the day  which only made such cruel sights the longer visible   The weather affected Mr  Woodhouse  and he could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter s side  and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before  It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete  on the evening of Mrs  Weston s wedding-day; but Mr  Knightley had walked in then  soon after tea  and dissipated every melancholy fancy  Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield s attraction  as those sort of visits conveyed  might shortly be over  The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter  had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them  no pleasures had been lost —But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction  The prospect before her now  was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled—that might not be even partially brightened  If all took place that might take place among the circle of her friends  Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the spirits only of ruined happiness   The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and Mrs  Weston s heart and time would be occupied by it  They should lose her; and  probably  in great measure  her husband also —Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss Fairfax  it was reasonable to suppose  would soon cease to belong to Highbury  They would be married  and settled either at or near Enscombe  All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses  the loss of Donwell were to be added  what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach  Mr  Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!—No longer walking in at all hours  as if ever willing to change his own home for their s!—How was it to be endured  And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet s sake; if he were to be thought of hereafter  as finding in Harriet s society all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen  the first  the dearest  the friend  the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind  that it had been all her own work   When it came to such a pitch as this  she was not able to refrain from a start  or a heavy sigh  or even from walking about the room for a few seconds—and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn  was in the resolution of her own better conduct  and the hope that  however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past  it would yet find her more rational  more acquainted with herself  and leave her less to regret when it were gone       CHAPTER XIII  The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the same loneliness  and the same melancholy  seemed to reign at Hartfield—but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again  With all the eagerness which such a transition gives  Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible  Never had the exquisite sight  smell  sensation of nature  tranquil  warm  and brilliant after a storm  been more attractive to her  She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr  Perry s coming in soon after dinner  with a disengaged hour to give her father  she lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery —There  with spirits freshened  and thoughts a little relieved  she had taken a few turns  when she saw Mr  Knightley passing through the garden door  and coming towards her —It was the first intimation of his being returned from London  She had been thinking of him the moment before  as unquestionably sixteen miles distant —There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind  She must be collected and calm  In half a minute they were together  The  were quiet and constrained on each side  She asked after their mutual friends; they were all well —When had he left them —Only that morning  He must have had a wet ride —Yes —He meant to walk with her  she found  
 They walked together  He was silent  She thought he was often looking at her  and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give  And this belief produced another dread  Perhaps he wanted to speak to her  of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for encouragement to begin —She did not  could not  feel equal to lead the way to any such subject  He must do it all himself  Yet she could not bear this silence  With him it was most unnatural  She considered—resolved—and  trying to smile  began—    said he quietly  and looking at her; 
  After waiting a moment  as if to be sure she intended to say no more  he replied      Emma was quite relieved  and could presently say  with a little more composure    For a moment or two nothing was said  and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest  till she found her arm drawn within his  and pressed against his heart  and heard him thus saying  in a tone of great sensibility  speaking low    Her arm was pressed again  as he added  in a more broken and subdued accent  
—And in a louder  steadier tone  he concluded with  
 Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure  excited by such tender consideration  replied     cried he  looking eagerly at her  
—but checking himself—
  said Emma  trying to be lively  but really confused—
 He listened in perfect silence  She wished him to speak  but he would not  She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion  She went on  however    She had hoped for an answer here—for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and  as far as she could judge  deep in thought  At last  and tolerably in his usual tone  he said     said Emma; 
  returned Mr  Knightley  with energy  
   Emma could say no more  They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet  and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject  if possible  She made her plan; she would speak of something totally different—the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for breath to begin  when Mr  Knightley startled her  by saying     she eagerly cried  
  Emma could not bear to give him pain  He was wishing to confide in her—perhaps to consult her;—cost her what it would  she would listen  She might assist his resolution  or reconcile him to it; she might give just praise to Harriet  or  by representing to him his own independence  relieve him from that state of indecision  which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his —They had reached the house    —replied Emma—quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke—
 And  after proceeding a few steps  she added—
 —repeated Mr  Knightley —
 He stopped in his earnestness to look the question  and the expression of his eyes overpowered her    said he  
—She could really say nothing —
 he cried  with great animation; 
 Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment  The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream  was perhaps the most prominent feeling    he soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere  decided  intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing —
 While he spoke  Emma s mind was most busy  and  with all the wonderful velocity of thought  had been able—and yet without losing a word—to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet s hopes had been entirely groundless  a mistake  a delusion  as complete a delusion as any of her own—that Harriet was nothing; that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her agitation  her doubts  her reluctance  her discouragement  had been all received as discouragement from herself —And not only was there time for these convictions  with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet s secret had not escaped her  and to resolve that it need not  and should not —It was all the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet  as infinitely the most worthy of the two—or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever  without vouchsafing any motive  because he could not marry them both  Emma had it not  She felt for Harriet  with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad  opposing all that could be probable or reasonable  entered her brain  She had led her friend astray  and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings  and as strong as it had ever been before  in reprobating any such alliance for him  as most unequal and degrading  Her way was clear  though not quite smooth —She spoke then  on being so entreated —What did she say —Just what she ought  of course  A lady always does —She said enough to shew there need not be despair—and to invite him to say more himself  He had despaired at one period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence  as for the time crushed every hope;—she had begun by refusing to hear him —The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;—her proposal of taking another turn  her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to  might be a little extraordinary!—She felt its inconsistency; but Mr  Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it  and seek no farther explanation   Seldom  very seldom  does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised  or a little mistaken; but where  as in this case  though the conduct is mistaken  the feelings are not  it may not be very material —Mr  Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed  or a heart more disposed to accept of his   He had  in fact  been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence  He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it  He had come  in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill s engagement  with no selfish view  no view at all  but of endeavouring  if she allowed him an opening  to soothe or to counsel her —The rest had been the work of the moment  the immediate effect of what he heard  on his feelings  The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill  of her having a heart completely disengaged from him  had given birth to the hope  that  in time  he might gain her affection himself;—but it had been no present hope—he had only  in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment  aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her —The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting —The affection  which he had been asking to be allowed to create  if he could  was already his!—Within half an hour  he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind  to something so like perfect happiness  that it could bear no other name   Her change was equal —This one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved  had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance  jealousy  or distrust —On his side  there had been a long-standing jealousy  old as the arrival  or even the expectation  of Frank Churchill —He had been in love with Emma  and jealous of Frank Churchill  from about the same period  one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other  It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country —The Box Hill party had decided him on going away  He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted  encouraged attentions —He had gone to learn to be indifferent —But he had gone to a wrong place  There was too much domestic happiness in his brother s house; woman wore too amiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma—differing only in those striking inferiorities  which always brought the other in brilliancy before him  for much to have been done  even had his time been longer —He had stayed on  however  vigorously  day after day—till this very morning s post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax —Then  with the gladness which must be felt  nay  which he did not scruple to feel  having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma  was there so much fond solicitude  so much keen anxiety for her  that he could stay no longer  He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner  to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures  faultless in spite of all her faults  bore the discovery   He had found her agitated and low —Frank Churchill was a villain — He heard her declare that she had never loved him  Frank Churchill s character was not desperate —She was his own Emma  by hand and word  when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then  he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow       CHAPTER XIV  What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out!—she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering;—she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness  and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away   They sat down to tea—the same party round the same table—how often it had been collected!—and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn  and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun!—But never in such a state of spirits  never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house  or even the attentive daughter   Poor Mr  Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming  and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride —Could he have seen the heart  he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil  without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either  he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr  Perry  and talked on with much self-contentment  totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return   As long as Mr  Knightley remained with them  Emma s fever continued; but when he was gone  she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued—and in the course of the sleepless night  which was the tax for such an evening  she found one or two such very serious points to consider  as made her feel  that even her happiness must have some alloy  Her father—and Harriet  She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost  was the question  With respect to her father  it was a question soon answered  She hardly knew yet what Mr  Knightley would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father —She even wept over the idea of it  as a sin of thought  While he lived  it must be only an engagement; but she flattered herself  that if divested of the danger of drawing her away  it might become an increase of comfort to him —How to do her best by Harriet  was of more difficult decision;—how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy —On these subjects  her perplexity and distress were very great—and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it —She could only resolve at last  that she would still avoid a meeting with her  and communicate all that need be told by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury  and—indulging in one scheme more—nearly resolve  that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square —Isabella had been pleased with Harriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement —She did not think it in Harriet s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety  by the streets  the shops  and the children —At any rate  it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself  from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the evil day  when they must all be together again   She rose early  and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which left her so very serious  so nearly sad  that Mr  Knightley  in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast  did not arrive at all too soon; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him  literally and figuratively  was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before   He had not left her long  by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else  when a letter was brought her from Randalls—a very thick letter;—she guessed what it must contain  and deprecated the necessity of reading it —She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations  she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself—and as for understanding any thing he wrote  she was sure she was incapable of it —It must be waded through  however  She opened the packet; it was too surely so;—a note from Mrs  Weston to herself  ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs  Weston                                                                                  [To Mrs  Weston ]                                                         WINDSOR-JULY  MY DEAR MADAM   I shall be very glad to look it over 
but it seems long  I will take it home with me at night 
I would rather be talking to you 
but as it seems a matter of justice  it shall be done 
Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago  Emma  it would not have been taken with such indifference 
Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his way  One man s style must not be the rule of another s  We will not be severe 
It will be natural for me 
to speak my opinion aloud as I read  By doing it  I shall feel that I am near you  It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—
Not at all  I should wish it 
He trifles here 
as to the temptation  He knows he is wrong  and has nothing rational to urge —Bad —He ought not to have formed the engagement — His father s disposition: —he is unjust  however  to his father  Mr  Weston s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions; but Mr  Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it —Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here 
And I have not forgotten 
how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would  You pass it over very handsomely—but you were perfectly right 
I was not quite impartial in my judgment  Emma:—but yet  I think—had you not been in the case—I should still have distrusted him 
Very bad—though it might have been worse —Playing a most dangerous game  Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal —No judge of his own manners by you —Always deceived in fact by his own wishes  and regardless of little besides his own convenience —Fancying you to have fathomed his secret  Natural enough!—his own mind full of intrigue  that he should suspect it in others —Mystery; Finesse—how they pervert the understanding! My Emma  does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other 
You had better go on 
the pianoforte! Ah! That was the act of a very  very young man  one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure  A boyish scheme  indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument s coming if she could 
I perfectly agree with you  sir 
You did behave very shamefully  You never wrote a truer line 
This is very bad —He had induced her to place herself  for his sake  in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness  and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily —She must have had much more to contend with  in carrying on the correspondence  than he could  He should have respected even unreasonable scruples  had there been such; but hers were all reasonable  We must look to her one fault  and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement  to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment 
There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends  the Eltons 
His feelings are natural —What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!—She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each—she dissolved it —What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!—Well  he must be a most extraordinary—
Nay  nay  read on —You will find how very much he suffers 
I hope he does 
 Smallridge! —What does this mean  What is all this 
She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs  Smallridge s children—a dear friend of Mrs  Elton s—a neighbour of Maple Grove; and  by the bye  I wonder how Mrs  Elton bears the disappointment 
Say nothing  my dear Emma  while you oblige me to read—not even of Mrs  Elton  Only one page more  I shall soon have done  What a letter the man writes!
I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him 
Well  there is feeling here —He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill —Certainly  I can have no doubt of his being fond of her   Dearer  much dearer than ever   I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation —He is a very liberal thanker  with his thousands and tens of thousands — Happier than I deserve   Come  he knows himself there   Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune  —Those were Miss Woodhouse s words  were they — And a fine ending—and there is the letter  The child of good fortune! That was your name for him  was it 
You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still you must  at least I hope you must  think the better of him for it  I hope it does him some service with you 
Yes  certainly it does  He has had great faults  faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he is  beyond a doubt  really attached to Miss Fairfax  and will soon  it may be hoped  have the advantage of being constantly with her  I am very ready to believe his character will improve  and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants  And now  let me talk to you of something else  I have another person s interest at present so much at heart  that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill  Ever since I left you this morning  Emma  my mind has been hard at work on one subject 
While her dear father lived  any change of condition must be impossible for her  She could never quit him 
Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for 
I am sure William Larkins will not like it  You must get his consent before you ask mine 
Beg her to walk up;
This is most kind  indeed!—Miss Woodhouse  it is impossible for me to express—I hope you will believe—Excuse me for being so entirely without words 
         You know all other things give place 
 And again  on Emma s merely turning her head to look at Mrs  Bates s knitting  she added  in a half whisper    Emma could not doubt  It was a palpable display  repeated on every possible occasion  When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs  Weston  she found herself abruptly addressed with   —And when Mrs  Bates was saying something to Emma  whispered farther  
  she shortly afterwards began  
 Soon after this Miss Bates came in  and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself  resulting  she supposed  from doubt of what might be said  and impatience to say every thing       And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma—
 Miss Bates looked about her  so happily—!   Emma would not have smiled for the world  and only said     said Emma  
  was the abrupt answer  which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs  Elton s side —
 she continued  
     It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words  not to Mrs  Elton  but to Miss Woodhouse  as the latter plainly saw  The wish of distinguishing her  as far as civility permitted  was very evident  though it could not often proceed beyond a look   Mr  Elton made his appearance  His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity    Mr  Elton was so hot and tired  that all this wit seemed thrown away  His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering  and the walk he had had for nothing    said he  
  cried his wife —
  Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary  indeed  and that she had not a syllable to say for him    said Mrs  Elton   feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do   
  continued Mr  Elton  
 Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly  In all probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr  Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr  Elton  if not towards William Larkins   She was pleased  on taking leave  to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room  to go with her even downstairs; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of  to say     cried Jane  with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure—
  cried Emma warmly  and taking her hand  
       replied Emma  smiling—
 The smile was returned as Jane answered         CHAPTER XVII  Mrs  Weston s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma  it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl  She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston  She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her  hereafter  with either of Isabella s sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best  It would be a great comfort to Mr  Weston  as he grew older—and even Mr  Weston might be growing older ten years hence—to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense  the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs  Weston—no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach  should not have their powers in exercise again    she continued—
  replied Mr  Knightley  
  cried Emma; 
  Emma laughed  and replied:    cried Emma  
       she added presently  laughing and blushing—
 Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her  to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies—her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject —She could not enter on it —Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them  This  on his side  might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy  and a suspicion  from some appearances  that their friendship were declining  She was aware herself  that  parting under any other circumstances  they certainly should have corresponded more  and that her intelligence would not have rested  as it now almost wholly did  on Isabella s letters  He might observe that it was so  The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him  was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy   Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits  which appeared perfectly natural  as there was a dentist to be consulted; but  since that business had been over  she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before —Isabella  to be sure  was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children  it would not have escaped her  Emma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on  by Harriet s being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least  Mr  and Mrs  John Knightley were to come down in August  and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back    said Mr  Knightley  
 It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage  Emma accepted it with a very eager hand  with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it  and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned    continued Mr  Knightley  
  replied Emma  when she had read the letter  
   interrupted she  with a sort of serious smile—
   she cried with more thorough gaiety  
  he cried  
   The time was coming when the news must spread farther  and other persons  reception of it tried  As soon as Mrs  Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr  Woodhouse s visits  Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause  resolved first to announce it at home  and then at Randalls —But how to break it to her father at last!—She had bound herself to do it  in such an hour of Mr  Knightley s absence  or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her  and she must have put it off; but Mr  Knightley was to come at such a time  and follow up the beginning she was to make —She was forced to speak  and to speak cheerfully too  She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him  by a melancholy tone herself  She must not appear to think it a misfortune —With all the spirits she could command  she prepared him first for something strange  and then  in a few words  said  that if his consent and approbation could be obtained—which  she trusted  would be attended with no difficulty  since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she and Mr  Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person s company whom she knew he loved  next to his daughters and Mrs  Weston  best in the world   Poor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him  and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it  She was reminded  more than once  of having always said she would never marry  and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella  and poor Miss Taylor —But it would not do  Emma hung about him affectionately  and smiled  and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs  Weston  whose marriages taking them from Hartfield  had  indeed  made a melancholy change: but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr  Knightley always at hand  when he were once got used to the idea —Did he not love Mr  Knightley very much —He would not deny that he did  she was sure —Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr  Knightley —Who was so useful to him  who so ready to write his letters  who so glad to assist him —Who so cheerful  so attentive  so attached to him —Would not he like to have him always on the spot —Yes  That was all very true  Mr  Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see him every day;—but they did see him every day as it was —Why could not they go on as they had done   Mr  Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome  the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest —To Emma s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr  Knightley s  whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to by each  on every fair occasion —They had all the assistance which Isabella could give  by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs  Weston was ready  on the first meeting  to consider the subject in the most serviceable light—first  as a settled  and  secondly  as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr  Woodhouse s mind —It was agreed upon  as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it  he began to think that some time or other—in another year or two  perhaps—it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place   Mrs  Weston was acting no part  feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event —She had been extremely surprized  never more so  than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all  and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost —She had such a regard for Mr  Knightley  as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper  suitable  and unexceptionable a connexion  and in one respect  one point of the highest importance  so peculiarly eligible  so singularly fortunate  that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature  and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it  and wished it long ago —How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr  Knightley could know and bear with Mr  Woodhouse  so as to make such an arrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr  Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband s plans and her own  for a marriage between Frank and Emma  How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by Mr  Weston than by herself—but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying— Mrs  Weston  with her baby on her knee  indulging in such reflections as these  was one of the happiest women in the world  If any thing could increase her delight  it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps   The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr  Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind —He saw the advantages of the match  and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it    said he  
 He went to Highbury the next morning  and satisfied himself on that point  He told her the news  Was not she like a daughter  his eldest daughter —he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present  it passed  of course  to Mrs  Cole  Mrs  Perry  and Mrs  Elton  immediately afterwards  It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls  how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves  as the evening wonder in many a family circle  with great sagacity   In general  it was a very well approved match  Some might think him  and others might think her  the most in luck  One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell  and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet  upon the whole  there was no serious objection raised  except in one habitation  the Vicarage —There  the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction  Mr  Elton cared little about it  compared with his wife; he only hoped  and supposed 
 and  on the point of living at Hartfield  could daringly exclaim  
—But Mrs  Elton was very much discomposed indeed —
     CHAPTER XVIII  Time passed on  A few more to-morrows  and the party from London would be arriving  It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one morning  as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her  when Mr  Knightley came in  and distressing thoughts were put by  After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then  in a graver tone  began with        said he  composing his features  
   he replied  
 He paused a moment  again smiling  with his eyes fixed on her face  
 Her cheeks flushed at the name  and she felt afraid of something  though she knew not what    cried he  
   Emma gave a start  which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes  in eager gaze  said    continued Mr  Knightley; 
 She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement     she replied  exerting herself  
  answered Mr  Knightley  with smiling but determined decision  
  she cried —
—Then having recourse to her workbasket  in excuse for leaning down her face  and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing  she added  
  He stopped —Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply  To speak  she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness  She must wait a moment  or he would think her mad  Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while  he added    He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering     replied Mr  Knightley; 
 Emma could not help laughing as she answered   The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr  Knightley and Robert Martin was  at this moment  so strong to Emma s feelings  and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet s side  so fresh the sound of those words  spoken with such emphasis    cried Mr  Knightley  
   he replied  speaking very distinctly  
  replied Emma  with the brightest smiles  
     cried Emma  shaking her head —
 She checked herself  however  and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved   Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father  She was not sorry  She wanted to be alone  Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder  which made it impossible for her to be collected  She was in dancing  singing  exclaiming spirits; and till she had moved about  and talked to herself  and laughed and reflected  she could be fit for nothing rational   Her father s business was to announce James s being gone out to put the horses to  preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she had  therefore  an immediate excuse for disappearing   The joy  the gratitude  the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined  The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet s welfare  she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security —What had she to wish for  Nothing  but to grow more worthy of him  whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own  Nothing  but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future   Serious she was  very serious in her thankfulness  and in her resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh  sometimes in the very midst of them  She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart—such a Harriet!  Now there would be pleasure in her returning—Every thing would be a pleasure  It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin   High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities  was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr  Knightley would soon be over  The disguise  equivocation  mystery  so hateful to her to practise  might soon be over  She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty   In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not always listening  but always agreeing to what he said; and  whether in speech or silence  conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day  or poor Mrs  Weston would be disappointed   They arrived —Mrs  Weston was alone in the drawing-room:—but hardly had they been told of the baby  and Mr  Woodhouse received the thanks for coming  which he asked for  when a glimpse was caught through the blind  of two figures passing near the window    said Mrs  Weston  
 In half a minute they were in the room  Emma was extremely glad to see him—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing recollections on each side  They met readily and smiling  but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down again  there was for some time such a blank in the circle  that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged  which she had long felt  of seeing Frank Churchill once more  and of seeing him with Jane  would yield its proportion of pleasure  When Mr  Weston joined the party  however  and when the baby was fetched  there was no longer a want of subject or animation—or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say     cried Emma  most happy to begin  
 He thanked her with all his heart  and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness    said he  turning his eyes towards Jane  
 But his spirits were soon rising again  and with laughing eyes  after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells  he named the name of Dixon —Emma blushed  and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing    she cried  
  he answered  
     resumed he  
 Emma spoke her pity so very kindly  that with a sudden accession of gay thought  he cried    then sinking his voice  and looking demure for the moment—
 He paused —She coloured and laughed —
 Emma was delighted  and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane  and his next words were     replied Emma  archly; 
  But he laughed so heartily at the recollection  that Emma could not help saying      He bowed    she presently added  with a look of true sensibility  
  he answered  warmly  
   The others had been talking of the child  Mrs  Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under  the evening before  from the infant s appearing not quite well  She believed she had been foolish  but it had alarmed her  and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr  Perry  Perhaps she ought to be ashamed  but Mr  Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself —In ten minutes  however  the child had been perfectly well again  This was her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr  Woodhouse  who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry  and only regretted that she had not done it   Frank Churchill caught the name    said he to Emma  and trying  as he spoke  to catch Miss Fairfax s eye  
 Emma soon recollected  and understood him; and while she joined in the laugh  it was evident from Jane s countenance that she too was really hearing him  though trying to seem deaf    he cried  
 Jane was forced to smile completely  for a moment; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him  and said in a conscious  low  yet steady voice    He had a great deal to say in return  and very entertainingly; but Emma s feelings were chiefly with Jane  in the argument; and on leaving Randalls  and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men  she felt  that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill  and really regarding him as she did with friendship  she had never been more sensible of Mr  Knightley s high superiority of character  The happiness of this most happy day  received its completion  in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced       CHAPTER XIX  If Emma had still  at intervals  an anxious feeling for Harriet  a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr  Knightley  and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination  it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty  A very few days brought the party from London  and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet  than she became perfectly satisfied—unaccountable as it was!—that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr  Knightley  and was now forming all her views of happiness   Harriet was a little distressed—did look a little foolish at first: but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly  and self-deceived  before  her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words  and leave her without a care for the past  and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for  as to her friend s approbation  Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature  by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations —Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley s  and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight  But what did such particulars explain —The fact was  as Emma could now acknowledge  that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible —Beyond this  it must ever be unintelligible to Emma   The event  however  was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so —Harriet s parentage became known  She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman  rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers  and decent enough to have always wished for concealment —Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!—It was likely to be as untainted  perhaps  as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr  Knightley—or for the Churchills—or even for Mr  Elton!—The stain of illegitimacy  unbleached by nobility or wealth  would have been a stain indeed   No objection was raised on the father s side; the young man was treated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin  who was now introduced at Hartfield  she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend  She had no doubt of Harriet s happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him  and in the home he offered  there would be the hope of more  of security  stability  and improvement  She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her  and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety  and occupied enough for cheerfulness  She would be never led into temptation  nor left for it to find her out  She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world  to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;—or  if not quite the luckiest  to yield only to herself   Harriet  necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins  was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted —The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and  fortunately  what ought to be  and must be  seemed already beginning  and in the most gradual  natural manner   Before the end of September  Emma attended Harriet to church  and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction  as no remembrances  even connected with Mr  Elton as he stood before them  could impair —Perhaps  indeed  at that time she scarcely saw Mr  Elton  but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself —Robert Martin and Harriet Smith  the latest couple engaged of the three  were the first to be married   Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury  and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells —The Mr  Churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for November   The intermediate month was the one fixed on  as far as they dared  by Emma and Mr  Knightley —They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield  to allow them the fortnight s absence in a tour to the seaside  which was the plan —John and Isabella  and every other friend  were agreed in approving it  But Mr  Woodhouse—how was Mr  Woodhouse to be induced to consent —he  who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event   When first sounded on the subject  he was so miserable  that they were almost hopeless —A second allusion  indeed  gave less pain —He began to think it was to be  and that he could not prevent it—a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation  Still  however  he was not happy  Nay  he appeared so much otherwise  that his daughter s courage failed  She could not bear to see him suffering  to know him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr  Knightleys  that when once the event were over  his distress would be soon over too  she hesitated—she could not proceed   In this state of suspense they were befriended  not by any sudden illumination of Mr  Woodhouse s mind  or any wonderful change of his nervous system  but by the operation of the same system in another way —Mrs  Weston s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys—evidently by the ingenuity of man  Other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered —Pilfering was housebreaking to Mr  Woodhouse s fears —He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his son-in-law s protection  would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life  The strength  resolution  and presence of mind of the Mr  Knightleys  commanded his fullest dependence  While either of them protected him and his  Hartfield was safe —But Mr  John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November   The result of this distress was  that  with a much more voluntary  cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment  she was able to fix her wedding-day—and Mr  Elton was called on  within a month from the marriage of Mr  and Mrs  Robert Martin  to join the hands of Mr  Knightley and Miss Woodhouse   The wedding was very much like other weddings  where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs  Elton  from the particulars detailed by her husband  thought it all extremely shabby  and very inferior to her own —
